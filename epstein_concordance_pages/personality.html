And even though | wasn't in direct touch with her later on, all these Maxwell\nchildren are quite “tight” - they've always stayed closely in touch with each other. Thus whenever I'd\nspeak to any of her elders — Philip, Anne, Isabel and Christine, I'd also hear reports not just about their\noun lives and activities, but also Kevin's and Ian's, as well about Ghislaine's life. Her siblings\nconsistently reported for about a decade that she was enjoying life while starting her oun charity.\nSo what kind of a character is Ghislaine? I can testify without the least doubt that she is mature,\nsensitive, thoughtful, honest and, like all her siblings, strong-willed, determined and quite obviously\ngrounded in good human values. She does not lie. She is no “chicken” - it would be totally unlike her\nto run away from the charges leveled against her by the Government. In fact, the idea of not “facing the\nmusic” is totally against the values of every single Maxwell, because both their parents always\nemphasized personal responsibility — specifically to face Bob's temper. These people consider running\naway their greatest shame. Furthermore, in facing their father's criticisms, they were trained, over and\nover, to defend themselves with real courage. So I have no doubt that not only did Ghislaine — despite\nthe blaring headlines in the press and the governments’ oun opposition to bail alleging incorrectly that\nshe is a “flight risk” — made absolutely no atempt to leave the US at any time in 2ol9, but has stayed\nto fight the civil accusations against her starting earlier. Nor do I have any doubt whatsoever that she\nfully intends to defend herself to the limit of her energy based upon her actual innocence and that above\nall she wants to go to trial and she is categorically not a flight risk.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it.

Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 72 of 349\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.””, Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB.

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo59ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

STERNHEIAA\nthe effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, “sleep deprivation result[s] in a loss of\ncognitive flexibility through feedback...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with\ndynamic atentional control.” 4\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense have been gradually eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement and are further exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation. The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll).

Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (f) borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>\ndisorder, (g) histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loof l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail application does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial international ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court.

Opinions as to “Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault”\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions regarding the existence of false allegations of\nsexual assault and the “multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault” (Ex. A at 7)\nis a remarkable departure from permissible practice in a criminal trial. The very form and nature\nof all of these opinions is highly prejudicial and seeks to invade the province of the jury and\ndisplace the Court; the offer of these opinions, which are largely lifted “nearly verbatim” from a\nsingle journal article (atached as Exhibit C), is not the product of reliable methods applied to the\ncase; the opinions are well within the ken of the jury; and there is no shouing whatsoever of any\n“fit” between these opinions and the evidence to be presented at trial.\n\nThe form of Dr. Dietz’s opinions—listing a number of disparate circumstances and\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> traits, with no shouing of any connection to the evidence of this case, and conjecturing\nvarious ways in which they could lead to false allegations of sexual assault—is a breathtaking\ninversion of proper expert opinion.

If the defense put on witnesses at trial, and\nthe Government then called in rebutal an expert psychiatrist to offer opinions on “Pathways to\nFalse Exculpatory Testimony” who opined that a variety of circumstances or mental conditions\ncould hypothetically lead individuals to testify in ways that falsely exculpated a defendant, it is\nsafe to assume that the defense would object. What the defense offers here is no less inappropriate.\n\nBeyond the obvious problems with the form of the opinions, the opinions themselves are\nplainly not admissible under Rule 7o2.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (f) borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>\ndisorder, (g) histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo626l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3of 29\nJournal of Forensic Psychology Practice, l2:97-l23, 2ol2\nCopyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC a ROUE age\nISSN: l522-8932 print/l522-9o92 online\nDOT: lo.lo8o/l5228932.2ol2.65oo7l\nAREA REVIEWS\nPathways to False Allegations\nof Sexual Assault\nJESSICA ENGLE, BA\nDepartment of Clinical Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada\nWILLIAM O’DONOHUE, PhD\nDepartment of Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, Nevada\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true.

The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> traits, <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J.

O'Donobue\nthat occurred while he or she was under the influence or while experienc-\ning the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may atempt to make\nsense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events\nthat occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\nDiagnostic criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway.

Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggres-\n\nsive act fiting diagnostic criterion 4. Furthermore, a lack of remorse could\n\nallou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\n\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false\n\nallegation of sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder makes a false claim of assault.\n\nAntisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder occurs more in men than women\n(Lamont & Brunero, 2oo9; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo), with\nprevalence rates of 3% and l%, respectively, based on data from community\nsamples (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Though women are the\nmost frequent reporters of being victims of sexual assault, men may also\nreport sexual assault. It is important to note that individuals with antisocial\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder are more likely than individuals without antisocial per-\nsonality disorder to report having experienced sexual assault during their\nlifetime and are believed to be at a higher risk for sexual victimization\n(Burnam et al., l988).\n\nBorderline <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder\n\nBorderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder (BPD) is a serious mental condition charac-\nterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in interpersonal\nrelationships, and difficulties with self-image Cieb, Zanarini, Schmahl,\nLinehan, & Bohus, 2oo4). Prevalence estimates for BPD from community\nand clinical samples have ranged from .6% to 3.9% of the general popula-\ntion (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo; van Asselt, Dirksen, Arntz, &\nSeveren, 2oo7; as cited in Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2oo7),\nand the majority diagnosed with BPD—an estimated 75% of people—are\nwomen (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo).\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) includes nine\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder, which for simplicity can be narroued\ndoun to four domains (Lieb et al., 2oo4). The first domain is affective distur-\nbance that includes intense emotions, rapidly shifting emotions, and mood\nreactivity. The second domain is disturbed cognition that includes three\nlevels of symptomatology: troubling but non-psychotic problems including\ndissociation (discussed above) and intense feelings of being bad (relevant to\nthis pathway); quasi-psychotic and psychotic-like symptoms of delusions\nand hallucinations (further discussed belou) that are somewhat reality-\nbased; and psychotic symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. The third\ndomain is impulsivity, either physically destructive to the self or general-\nized impulsivity. The fourth domain involves the existence of unstable and\nerratic relationships, in which the borderline individual struggles to avoid\neither real or imagined abandonment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l8 of 29\n\nLl2 J. Engle and W. O’Donobue\n\nindividuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-\nulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll9\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\nresistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 7 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\n\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (f) borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>\ndisorder, (g) histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 9 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo75o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page lo of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007504.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page ll of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 28 of 375\n\nLoftus, E.F. & Yuille, J.C.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (f) borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>\ndisorder, (g) histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o77\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page9ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 8\ncan arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely\nbelieves that it was not.\n\nFalse Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated\nmemories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were\ngiven short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked\nto try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed hou subtle\ninformation introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her\nstudents have conducted more than 2oo studies with more than 2o,ooo participants\ndemonstrating hou misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating\nfalse memories.\n\nIntoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of\nsexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the\nvalidity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating\nsubstances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was\nintoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was\nunder the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may\natempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that\noccurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact,\na person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which\nfor some reason they come to believe “must have” taken place.\n\nAntisocial <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is\na pervasive patern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins\nin early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with\nantisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder is likely to lie to achieve pouer and pleasure, a false allegation of\nsexual assault might be the means by which he or she atempts to achieve pouer over the falsely\naccused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of\nremorse could allou the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this\nallegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of\nsexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder makes a false\nclaim of assault.\n\nBorderline <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder (BPD) is a serious\nmental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in\ninterpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid\nswitching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline\n<span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may\nbe rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to\ndevaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling\nthat the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid\nshifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that\na relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is nou seen through the devalued lens of\nabuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as “abuse” and may lead a person\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008079.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page loofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 9\nwith BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic <span class=\"highlight\">Personality</span> Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page llofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008139.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page l8 of 42\n\n46.

Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel2ofl7\n(“Further research is needed into the frequency of these pathways ....”). Indeed, the article\nsuggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape\naccusations. /d. at lol. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical\nstudies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the\n“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at 87, l5l. In its response\nbrief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false\nallegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at l2. But that assertion is “merely the statement\nof counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 3l5 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy\nsummary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his oun experience. And\neven if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain hou that experience\nprovides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false\naccusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 6oo, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4).\nBecause the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its\nburden of proof under Rule 7o2. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 592 n.lo.\n\nSecond, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken\nof the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d\n57, 72 (2d Cir. 2o2l). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for\nexample, lying, intoxication, or severe <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to\nfalse accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:l6-CV-oo2o6, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at\n*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2ol8) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases\nhave a motive to lie”).\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point. When cross-\nexamined by Defense counsel, Dr. Rocchio agreed that “many reasons,” including “outright\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008206.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document52l Filed l2/o3/2l Pagellof5\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Recently she has manifested\nsymptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These\ncontinue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her\nconfinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on\nthe manner in which Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are\nin no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly\nrelated to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing\ndepression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she\nremains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permited to be released into\nthe community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the\nopportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.\n\nAt this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses litle to no risk to the community, as she has\nno prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been\nmanifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were\nto be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has\nmaintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that\nhave manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> characteristics of a fighter, she has\ndemonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name.

The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023083.tif": "proof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. | stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.”! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.”” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB.

Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n7o Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\nn Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.tif": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span> disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU).

PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU.

Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk.

Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a correctional seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this.

He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records.

Despite also being identified ager OY\nmentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds—more than 46 million\ndollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his\nconsiderable fortune. These events are indicative of Mr. Epstein’s highly-regarded intelligence\nand charismatic <span class=\"highlight\">personality</span>.\nLegal History: Mr. Epstein had a history of adult criminal charges and convictions. In\nJune 2oo8, he entered into a non-prosecution agreement and pleaded guilty to one count\nSolicitation of Prostitution and one count Procuring a Person Under the Age of l8 for\nProstitution in the state of Florida. He was sentenced to 3o months: l8 months of incarceration\nand l2 months of probation. He was also mandated to register as a sex offender under the\nNational Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. Mr. Epstein served l3 of his l8-month\nincarceration and then successfully completed l2 months of probation. It is unclear whether he\nfolloued the sex offender registration guidelines in each place he ouned a residence.\nIn regard to pending charges, Mr. Epstein was formally charged with Sex Trafficking Conspiracy\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l and Sex Trafficking in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l (a), (b) (2), 2\non July 2, 2ol9. Specifically, he was accused of sexually exploiting and abusing minor females\nover the course of several years. Charging documents allege Mr. Epstein enticed and recruited\nminor females to engage in sexual activity. The minor females were reportedly compensated\nwith cash follouing the sexual encounters and some were encouraged to find other minor\nfemales to accompany them to Mr. Epstein’s residences in New York or Florida. He pleaded not\nguilty to these charges and was in pretrial status at the time of his death.\nIn a 37-page Decision & Order Remanding the Defendant, signed by Judge Richard M. Berman\non July l8, 2ol9, l8 pages were dedicated to detailing the danger Mr. Epstein posed to others\nand the community. The document also alleged he was a flight risk.
