B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’).

(Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> as a basis to deny _ extradition.

In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of the person sought shall be\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> to persons who have acquired French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

The international ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> appear as one\nof the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\n“Ms Maxwell’s history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of\nflight. Ms Maxwell has substantial international ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States. She holds multiple foreign citizenships, has familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant\nvalue. In particular, she is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to\nextradite its citizens”.\n\n3.

Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-l) sets out\nlegislative provisions pertaining to extradition.\n\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states\nthat extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition\nis sought (« Extradition is not granted: l° When the person sought has the French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, the later being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is\nrequested. »»”’),\n\n54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an international\nconvention stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France l996”, which supersedes French law\nas mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n56. Article 3(l) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a\nperson who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the\nUnited States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if,\nin its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of the person sought\nshall be the <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n27 Tn French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordee : l° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite francaise, cete\nderniere etant appreciee a l'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\n28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure: “In the absence of an international convention stipulating\notherwise, the conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter.\nThese provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by international conventions”. (In\nFrench, « En l'absence de convention internationale en stipulant autrement, les conditions, la procedure et les\neffets de l'extradition sont determines par les dispositions du present chapitre. Ces dispositions s'appliquent\negalement aux points qui n'auraient pas ete reglementes par les conventions internationales »).\n° The Extradition treaty between the USA and France was signed in Paris on April 23, l996 and entered into force\non February l, 2oo2 (by Decree No. 2oo2-ll7 of 29 January 2oo2).\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l7\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l9 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n57. If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of the person sought, Article\n3(2) requires the requested State to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if\nso requested by the requesting State.\n\n58. Consequently, the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not\ncontain any prohibition on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it merely states that\nthere is no obligation upon the requested State to grant the extradition of a person who\nis one of its nationals.\n\n59. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA must therefore be distinguished\nfrom several international agreements on extradition ratified by France, which, by\ncontrast, contain a clear rule against the extradition of French citizens*?.\n\n6o. For example, France has made the follouing declaration pursuant to Article 6 of the\nEuropean Convention on Extradition l957, which gives Contracting States “the right to\nrefuse extradition of nationals”:\n\n“Extradition shall be refused when the person sought had French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> at the time\nof the alleged offence’.\n\n6l. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European Convention on\nExtradition”.\n\n62. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA is similar to other international\nagreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against the\nextradition of nationals. These are generally treaties signed with Common law\njurisdictions, which do not oppose the extradition of their nationals*’.\n\n3° See, for example, the Extradition treaty between France and Morocco, or the Extradition treaty between France\nand China.\n3! See France’s instrument of ratification of the European Convention on Extradition, deposited on lo February\nl986.\n32 The European Convention on Extradition l957 is an instrument of the Council of Europe which was signed in\nParis on December l3, l957 and came into force on April l8\", l96o. The European Convention on Extradition\nis open to signature by non-Council of Europe States, as such it was ratified by South Africa, Israel, and the\nRepublic of Korea. It was ratified by France on February lo\", l986.\n33 For example, the Extradition Treaty between France and Canada, signed in Otawa on l7 November l988,\ncontains a similar provision to the United States Treaty: “The requested State shall not be bound to extradite its\noun nationals. <span class=\"highlight\">Nationality</span> shall be determined as of the date of the offence for which extradition is requested”\n(Article 3).\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l8\n\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l43", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n69. Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> in the execution of a EAW. As such, <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an international amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported international treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 23 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\na United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\nprosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the\nFrench government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all\nthe relevant facts were commited in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also\nlocated in the USA.\n\n79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench competent authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition\nrequest, it would be difficult for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to\ndeny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”\n\n8o. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, and has\nsubstantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French\ngovernment as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.\n\n8l. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding\nWaiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail\nconditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive\nnot to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> as a ban to\nextradition.\n\nWilliam Julie\n37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 2o\nyears, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases. Louer court decisions granting extradition\nwere quashed only twice for procedural deficiencies not at issue in this case.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 335l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 22\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 2o of 36\nto other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in\nExhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the\nextradition of a person who had French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> at the time of the commission of the acts for\nwhich extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries\nis of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States\nand France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France\nsystematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial\nauthorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any\nanticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be\nrecognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.\n\nThe defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French\nauthorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition\nof a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from\nin that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.\nFor example, in 2oo6, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in\nto French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to commiting a murder in the United States.\nDespite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law\nenforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials.

In United\nStates v. Broun, No. 99-l23o(L), 2oo2 WL 34244994 (2d Cir.

(Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> as a basis to deny _ extradition.

In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25.

These provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by\ninternational conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international\nagreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties\nor agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an\nauthority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by\nthe other party’).

(Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> as a basis to deny _ extradition.

In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition.

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of the person sought shall be\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant international treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

If the\nperson is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not\napply.\n\nl2. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have\nexpressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to\nqualify the national affiliation of the requested person.\n\nl3. Furthermore, it is a well-knoun principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions\nthat exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> ban being an\nexception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application\nto a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.\n\nl4. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law\n\nl5. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact\nnot intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but\nonly in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the\ncommission of the alleged crime.\n\nl6. In other words, the rule that “<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> shall be assessed at the time of the offence for\nwhich extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> to persons who have acquired French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> after commiting an\noffence, in order to avoid fraudulent <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> applications of offenders seeking to\nescape extradition.\n\n3\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

France has no difficulty with deporting individuals who have lost French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> by\napplication of Article 25 of the Civil Code, which enumerates the list of crimes that may\ngive rise to a deprivation of citizenship. For example, a dual French-Algerian citizen\nnamed Djamel Beghal was recently deported to Algeria after he was convicted of\nterrorist offences and subsequently deprived of his French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span>’.\n\n24. While in custody in France, Djamel Beghal was also convicted in absentia to a term of\nprison in Algeria, but his extradition initially seemed impossible, not because he used\nto be a French citizen, but because the case law of the ECtHR specifically prohibits\nState parties from deporting persons deprived of their <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> to the State of which\nthey remain a national, when there is a risk of torture or degrading treatment?. Beghal\nwas eventually deported to Algeria where he was arrested upon landing for the purpose\nof standing trial. In this case, the French government’s decision to deprive Djamel\nBeghal of his French <span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> was clearly intended to allou for his removal from\nFrance, whether through extradition or deportation, as both means of removal were\nconceivable at the time. Had there not been a risk of violation of the ECHR at the time\nof the Algerian extradition request, he may well have been extradited as opposed to\ndeported a few years later, when that risk was eliminated.\n\n25. In any case, the deportation of formerly French citizens shous that the loss of French\n<span class=\"highlight\">nationality</span> prevents any retroactive application of domestic provisions which are\nintended to protect French nationals, be it from deportation or extradition.\n\n? htps://www.lemonde. fr/societe/article/2ol8/o7/l 6/incertitude-sur-le-sort-de-l-islamiste-djamel-beghal-qui-sort-\nde-prison-lundi_5332o53_ 3224. html\n> ECtHR 3 December 2oo9, Daoudi v.
