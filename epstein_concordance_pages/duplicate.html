Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage lo\nBruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol5) (“Even if Defendant had the financial capacity\nto replicate a private jail within his oun home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of\nconditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant,\nor that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.”)); Borodin,\nl36 F. Supp. 2d at l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool) (Nickerson, J.) (“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\n<span class=\"highlight\">duplicate</span> a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6l of 348\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to <span class=\"highlight\">duplicate</span> anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting <span class=\"highlight\">duplicate</span> prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding <span class=\"highlight\">duplicate</span> records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an unrelated employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003919.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 227 Filed o4/2l/2l Page2of3\nPage 2\n\nin question include, among other things, depositions of potential witnesses.' If the defense were\nto put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose\npermissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the\ndefense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,\nincluding to cross-examine trial witnesses.\n\nMoreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the\nGovernment submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to\noffer these materials under certain circumstances. For example, it is well established that a\ncriminal defendant who testifies in her oun defense may be impeached with materials that would\notherwise be subject to suppression. United States v. Trzaska, ll F.3d lol9, lo26 (2d Cir. l997)\n(“The Supreme Court has held that illegally acquired evidence may be used to impeach defendants\nwho testify in their oun defense.”) (citing Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 64-66 (l954)).\nAs the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusionary rule must be balanced with the truth-seeking\nfunctions of a trial:\n\nIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an\n\naffirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another\n\nto say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which\n\nevidence in the Government’s possession was obtained to his oun\n\nadvantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction\n\nof his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be\n\na perversion of the Fourth Amendment.\n' The Government further notes that many of the materials in the file in question are duplicates of\nmaterials the Government has obtained through other sources. For example, the file contains\nmaterials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law enforcement agencies. At\ntrial, the Government is likely to offer documents it has obtained during its investigation through\nother sources, even though those materials happen to be contained in <span class=\"highlight\">duplicate</span> in the file in\nquestion.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 62 of 349\nLourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal\nhigh school massage recruits that would be difficult to <span class=\"highlight\">duplicate</span> anywhere else,” which supported\nthe conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole\npurpose. Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive.

These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify.

Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act.

The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated.
