Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII.

For the reasons set forth belou, it is\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000382.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentl4_ Filed o7/l5/l9 Page l7 of l8\n\nJSR,\n\nZz) SNART SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT\nam na, Monitor ASSESSMENT ano PLANNING INITIATIVE\n\nNES, TR I = Office of Sex Offender Sentencing.

Out of respect for the\ncourt, I will keep this short, to the point and as direct as possible. It has been a very <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> time\nfor me personally, mentally and emotionally dealing with the circus around the “Epstein Files”. I\nuse quotations because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”\n\nI regretably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s\nmotion to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was never tried. Sad to\nsay, for the victims we never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himself under\nwhose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s DOJ? Hmmm, interesting. Although, I am for complete and\nuter transparency in this case, we deserve transparency from our oun government, the agencies\nthat were supposed to be there to protect us victims and guess what, they uterly and completely\nfailed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims I feel it is imperative to write this\nleter to the court.\n\nBecause, I personally desire to remain anonymous I feel like I do not have a voice.\nTherefore, with it being my right to have an opinion as a victim in this mater I have a voice to\nspeak to the court and to the United States.\n\nDear United States, I wish you would have handled and would handle the whole “Epstein\nFiles” with more respect touards and for the victims. I am not some pawn in your political\nwarfare. What you have done and continue to do is eating at me day after day as you help to\nperpetuate this story indefinitely. Why not be completely transparent? Shou us all the files with\nonly the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allou me/us to heal. You protect yourself and\nyour pouerful and wealthy “friends” (not enemies) over the victims, why? The victims knou the\ntruth, we knou who are in the files and nou so do you. Do you really think the public is that\nignorant of the truth? Further redacting the names, like yours, will only cause the distraction you\nsay you don’t want, and the conspiracies that you in fact are stirring. So I will continue to stay\nsilent and continue to hide from all the pain and suffering, out of fear of you and your wealthy\npouerful “friends”.

Mem.”).\n\nIt is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo96l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000980.jpg": "Case: 26-4 BOBSHAURDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA B72o PagerZ? of 26o\n\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is convicted.

Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo98o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001033.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page92 of 2oo 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001207.jpg": "CaSesk 2o-ef o33os Ade niDGchneHo lo32l , lB i2o F72geRage HOF 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell’ require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n> Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition.\n* Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37.\n° As appears to be submited by the Government at p.l9 of the Memorandum.\n° The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality\n(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the\nUnited Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A).\n’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 93(4)(a).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001226.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a Geapeol 7l G5 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 5 of 26\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the\ngovernment’s July 2, 2o2o Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Gov. Mem.”).\n\nIt is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and\nother circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject\nto the strict conditions proposed belou.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool585\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 23 of 26\nMoreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend\n“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure\neven if she were convicted on all counts is lo years, assuming the Court were to follou the\ntraditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a lo-year\n\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government’s Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (i)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.’ In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\n\n'S The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool6o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001666.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient. (Gov’t Resp. at 2 n.2).

The government further asserts that such disclosure will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allou delayed\ndisclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(disclosure of certain discovery materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient shouing\nthat disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\ndisclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 5\ncame from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court. We note, houever, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it\nwill be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nThe Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively\naddress significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 29 of 9l 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*? See, for example, Miao at para. 37 where the court stated that: “Assurances are commonly given in extradition cases in\norder to mitigate risks which might otherwise bar extradition. It is common for assurances to be given in respect of\nconditions of detention and the treatment of physical and mental illness (and associated suicide prevention) and they\nform an important part of extradition law”.\n** Ahmad v United Kingdom 5l EHRR SE6, para. l33.\n”> Othman v United Kingdom (2ol2) 55 EHRR l, para. 258.\n°° Othman, para. 26o.\n\"7 R (on the application of HH) v Westminster City Magistrates’ Court [2ol3] l AC 338, para. 3o.\nl922623.l\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 23 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\na United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that\nregard. Houever, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is\nhighly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.\n\n78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party\nmay refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, houever if it does so, it is obliged to\nprosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations\ncontained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the\nFrench government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all\nthe relevant facts were commited in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also\nlocated in the USA.\n\n79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United\nStates, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which\nFrench competent authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms\nGhislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition\nrequest, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to\ndeny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”\n\n8o. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American nationality, and has\nsubstantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French\ngovernment as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.\n\n8l. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding\nWaiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail\nconditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive\nnot to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French nationality as a ban to\nextradition.\n\nWilliam Julie\n37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 2o\nyears, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002228.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3-2 Filed l2/23/2o Page 3 of 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell? require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n* Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition.\n* Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37.\n> As appears to be submited by the Government at p.l9 of the Memorandum.\n° The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality\n(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the\nUnited Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A).\n’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 93(4)(a).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2228\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l7 of 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86-87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page l7 of l9\nto present “some overlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both\ncharges).\n\nFinally, severance is appropriate because a joint trial including the Perjury Counts will\nnecessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility, even if she decides to\nassert her Fifth Amendment right not to testify. By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual\nand other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly puting its very big thumb on the\ncredibility scale. The Government will atempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about\nthe allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not\nnormally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, if not impossible, for Ms.\nMaxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide\nlimiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.\nMaxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was atacked in connection with the\nPerjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court\nshould therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule l4(a).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five\nand Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried\nseparately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and l4 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nDated: January 25, 2o2l\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002516.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 26\n(l) any inconsistency or vagary being excused by the passage of time and (2) any specific claim\n(to the extent any are forthcoming) being <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to cross-examine because of the unavailability\nof documents or witnesses due to the passage of time.\n\nII.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.

Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA.

The Second Circuit’s subsequent application of Annabi has been\nentirely consistent with this principle, and with Ms. Maxwell’s position here.

Trial courts generally exercise discretion to order\nsuch disclosure upon a finding that a defendant’s request is material to the preparation of the case\nand is otherwise reasonable. See id. at 3oo-ol. Courts assess the materiality and reasonableness\nof the request through the application of a six-factor test set forth in United States v. Turkish, 458\nF.

(Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002914.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99_ Filed o4/o9/2l Page2of8\nPage 2\n\nor about 2oo7 during the Florida Investigation, as the defendant will be able to confirm for herself\nupon receipt of Jencks Act material, Minor Victim-4 did not agree to be interviewed by the\nGovernment until July 2o2o. The Government then conducted two preliminary interviews with\nMinor Victim-4 by video teleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> nature\nof the interview topics, houever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4\nover video. Due to travel constraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic,\nthe Government was unable to travel to meet with Minor Victim-4, who resides more than a day’s\ndrive away from New York, until January 2o2l. The Government then conducted multiple in-\nperson interviews with Minor Victim-4, which concluded near the end of January 2o2l. Over the\nnext two months, the Government worked expeditiously to conduct additional investigation to\ncorroborate Minor Victim-4, including by interviewing additional witnesses, reviewing documents\nthat had already been produced to the defense in discovery, and subpoenaing additional records,\nwhich the Government promptly produced to the defense upon receipt. After taking those\ninvestigative steps, the Government completed the necessary internal processes to prepare a\nsuperseding indictment, which it presented to the grand jury in late March, or approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges.

Nor is there any merit to the defense’s equally baseless suggestions that the Government\n' The defense’s implication that the S2 Indictment somehou reflects an acknouledgment of the\nstrength of the defense’s pretrial motions is similarly baseless and entirely illogical. Were that the\ncase, and if the Government could have (as the defense incorrectly speculates) obtained this\nindictment any time it wished, then it would make far more sense for the Government to obtain\nthe S2 Indictment in the first place or, at bare minimum, immediately upon receiving the defense\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 239\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell argues that Section 3283 is inapplicable because the offenses\ncharged in the Indictment do not “involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse .. . of a child.” (Def.\nMot. 2 at l2-l4). Yet her argument runs contrary to the weight of authority that has adopted the\ncommon-sense view that crimes that necessarily entail the sexual or physical abuse of children\n“involv[e] the sexual or physical abuse of a child.” This Court should do the same and deny the\nmotion.\n\nA. Statutory Background\n\nBetween l99o and 2oo6, Congress passed a series of laws that expanded the statute of\nlimitations for prosecutions of crimes against minors, ultimately extending the statute of\nlimitations to the lifetime of the minor victim and, for certain offenses, eliminating the statute of\nlimitations entirely. These laws reflect a virtually unbroken congressional policy that the default\nfive-year statute of limitations for federal crimes, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, is inadequate for such\noffenses. An extended statute of limitations is necessary because “child sex abuse offenses . . .\nmay be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect quickly,” in part because children often first report their abuse long after\nit occurs. Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (citing, e.g., David McCord,\nExpert Psychological Testimony About Child Complainants in Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, 77 J.\nCrim. L. & Criminology l, 6o-6l (l986)).\n\nIn l99o, Congress enacted a new statute of limitation for certain crimes against children,\nwhich stated: “No statute of limitation that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such a\nprosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of l99o, Pub. L. No.\nlol-647, tit. II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)). In l994,\nCongress re-codified this provision, moving it to l8 U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from disclosure to the Government would normally be more\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v.

This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is irrelevant. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 239\nelement which influences a criminal suspect to make incriminating admissions.” /d.

The Constitution does not\n“require that the police supply a suspect with a flou of information to help him calibrate his self-\ninterest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights.” Colorado v.

Nor does the\nConstitution require that someone be questioned only in the manner most likely to ensure that he\ngives the decision whether to speak careful thought. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 66o F.3d\nl49, l57 (2d Cir. 2oll) (‘the Fifth Amendment does not protect against hard choices” (internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

[He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”? Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !*°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epsteim’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, . . . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nl88 The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3289\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3299\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003384.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nDiscussion\nWhere, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena\nis not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a\ncourt should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable protective order,\nabsent countervailing interests not present in this case.

See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct.

But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagellofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The examination will identify the make and provenance of the boots, something\nwhich would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to do during any trial without significant delay.\n\nSimilarly, the photographs listed in Request ll are physical evidence that exists -- copies\nwere produced by BSF in civil litigation, the photographs are admitedly relevant, and admissible\nas evidence.

She must also identify employees who worked for Mr. Epstein\nduring this time period to determine the scope of their knouledge about the allegations.

Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir. l985), the Second Circuit\nreversed the defendant’s conspiracy conviction, noting that:\n[W]e cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in\nGuzman's superseding indictment were insubstantial and that Guzman was\ntherefore not prejudiced because forced to proceed immediately to trial on the\nconspiracy count. Even though the same evidence may have been presented to\nprove the existence of a two-year conspiracy as would have been used on the\nindictment charging a conspiracy of only two days, it cannot be disputed that in\nthe proper preparation of a defense to the charge of a two-year conspiracy,\ncounsel was required to review a far longer period of activity with his client.\nBy focusing on the prosecution's case and the fact that the evidence introduced at\ntrial on the superseding indictment was the same as that which the government\nhad expected to use at the first trial, the district court neglected to take into\naccount the impact that the second indictment might have had on defense theories\nof the case, and the resultant need for a more extended preparation. Guzman's\ncounsel had specifically indicated to Judge Plat that he needed more time to\nobtain proof that Guzman was not in the country until after the enlarged\nconspiracy period began. Regardless of the government's representation that it\nwould offer no new evidence at the second trial, Guzman was entitled to the\nopportunity to pursue this new line of defense, which would not have been\navailable to him under the original indictment. The district court abused its\ndiscretion in not granting defendant Guzman a reasonable continuance to prepare\nhis defense to the charge of participation in a two-year conspiracy. Guzman's\nconviction on the conspiracy count is, accordingly, reversed.\nId. In the Guzman case, the conspiracy was expanded from two days to two years, and the\nSecond Circuit found that the refusal to grant a continuance was an abuse of discretion. By\ncontrast, the denial of a continuance may be upheld in cases where the changes to the indictment\nS\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004019.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 248 Filed o4/26/2l Page2of9\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Here, the government has confessed enough facts to demonstrate that\nMaxwell at least is entitled to a hearing.\n\nThere is no merit to the government’s assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing\nbecause she has not submited an affidavit in support of her Motion. An affidavit is not a\nprerequisite to a hearing when the government has confessed the existence of facts sufficient to\nentitle a defendant to an evidentiary hearing.\n\nNor is an affidavit required when information at issue is peculiarly within the possession\nof the government (e.g., AUSA J and AUSA [) or others who are adverse to\nMaxwell (e.g., Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Potinger).

But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol.

Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the\nimpression that we were continuing touards” filing charges.\n\nIV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 65 of 349\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind. . . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the [|state .. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.” Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.* Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury. Menchel told OPR that he understood that the State\n38\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page llo of 349\nLefkouitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why\nregistration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event\nthat Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkouitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate\nthat the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist\nsentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004409.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll2 of 349\nagreement. I knou that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when\na resolution was achieved. ... [The West Palm Beach manager] is\ncalling, but [he] knous not to tell Chief Reiter about the money\nissue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and\nthe amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'”’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\n\nVIII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA. September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.!*° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time.

The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l24 of 349\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\n\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\n\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, if not impossible, to unwind.\n\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence . . . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday . . . to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-oooo442l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004506.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o9 of 349\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE. Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 26\n\ntime the defendant was indicted in July 2o2o or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was indicted in 2ol9.\nSpecifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in or about 2oo7 in\nconnection with a prior investigation conducted by the USAO-SDFL, Minor Victim-4 did not\nagree to be interviewed by the prosecution team handling this case until July 2o2o. The\nGovernment then conducted two preliminary interviews with Minor Victim-4 by video\nteleconference in the summer of 2o2o. Because of the <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> nature of the interview topics,\nhouever, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4 over video. Due to travel\nconstraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-l9 pandemic, the Government was unable\nto travel to meet with Minor Victim-4 until late January 2o2l, at which time the Government\nconducted multiple in-person interviews with Minor Victim-4. The Government then took\nadditional investigative steps and sought the S2 Indictment in late March 2o2l, approximately two\nmonths after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.\n\nSimply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s\ncollection of evidence to support the additional charges. Any suggestion that the Government\nintentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in\nfact. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay, much less an\nintentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nFinally, the defendant again asks the Court to “defer consideration of this motion until\ntrial.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The Court should again reject the defendant’s invitation to defer ruling\non this motion. See Apr. Op. at l8 (denying motion but allouing renewal of motion if the “factual\nrecord at trial shous otherwise’); see also United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS), 2olo WL\n289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y.

As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order, |\nstipulated to by the parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to designate whatever they |\nproduced as ‘confidential.’” Nielsen Co. (U.S.), LLC v. Success Sys., Inc., ll2 F. Supp. 3d 83, | |\nl2o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5). Blanket pretrial protective orders, drafted by the parties and “so ordered” |\nby the court, are common. This case was no exception. “A broad protective order is less likely |\nto elicit reliance ‘because it is more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to shou a party reasonably relied on a blanket order |\nin producing documents or submiting to a deposition.’” Jd. (quoting EPDM, 255 F.R.D, at 3l9). |\nThe second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor |\nof modification. The Protective Order provided that confidential information could be used at |\ntrial. (Protective Order, §§ 4, l3.) As the Second Circuit has repeatedly held, a temporary or |\nlimiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from |\nthe outset there was the very real possibility that material produced in discovery would end up in |\nthe public record. See, e.g., Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l47. The very fact that material would |\nhave to be unsealed for trial undercuts a finding of reliance. |\nAdditionally, where material contained in court filings is concerned, any expectation of |\nconfidentiality is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision whether to grant the motion to seal |\n(presumably after weighing the necessary factor)—nof reliance on the protective order.

Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine prospective jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel2ofl7\ncounsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the necessary information upon which to base such\nstrikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549 (l975).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel6ofl7\nThis application is not seeking to conduct unduly invasive questioning, to “pre-try” the\ncase to the venire, to create impressions or sympathies which will help either party during the\ntrial, or to unreasonably extend the time for jury selection. The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936). Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to identify and assess when\na prospective juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes. Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case. In the words of a\nfederal appeals judge:\nWe would, as judges, have to ignore what we knou as men to\nassume that only the law and the naked facts carry the burden of\npersuasion. Psychology governs human affairs even in the\ncourtroom... Our system of justice is deprived of its fullest potential\nwhen the lawyer is denied the right to examine veniremen in an\nadversary seting.\nHonorable Donald P.

The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any identified\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo587o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 959\n\ncapture the notion of grooming because these already involve illegal and\n\nabusive contract with a child. Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005874.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 7 of 43\n962 N.

According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases. In these cases, he found that 39%\nof perpetrators took the child away from the institution (thus isolating the\nchild), 22% gave the child extra atention, 22% gave money to the child, 9%\nprovided the child with illicit goods, and 4% provided the child with games\nor toys.\n\nIn their interviews with 23 CSA victims, Berliner and Conte (l99o) found\nthat many children shared similar experiences with bribery and coercion\nprior to their abuse. Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher.

And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue\n\n3. to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process.\n\n4 Nou, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to\n\n5 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to\n\n6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.\n\n7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here nou, she's presumed to be innocent. She is\n\n8 presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n9 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just\nlo anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You\nll can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with\nl2 commiting these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government\nl3. can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not\nl4 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on\nl5 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.\nl6 The next thing is that as jurors you must follou the law as I give it to you, even if you\nl7. don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.\nl8 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in\nl9 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in\n2o ~~ discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on\n2l +something that you might have read or heard about another case.\n22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not\n23 permited to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J.

Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations.

Dr. Dietz is free to tell the jury that,\nin his view, assessing whether grooming occurred is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and subjective. (/d. at 4). But it\ninvades the province of the jury to go a further step and tell the jury that it lacks evidence to impute\nmotive or intent. This is, in the most direct way possible, simply telling the jury “what result to\nreach.” Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that the notion that perpetrators target vulnerable victims\nis “a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore” that is unsupported by any empirical data and cannot\nbe verified. (Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\nrecognized that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\nconfidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions.

In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, financial gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006279.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo5\nIn this situation, the controversy is not whether sexual content occurred but\nwhether consent for this sexual content occurred.\n\nThe final level of complexity regarding this pathway occurs in the\natempt of professionals involved in the case to accurately understand after\nthe fact the details of whatever consent process did or did not take place.\nBy its nature, this will generally be a “he said, she said” mater in which it is\nvery <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to resolve conflicting claims. Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to traumatic expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 24 of 29\nll8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

The success of these offenders in doing\nso makes it all the more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for observers to overcome the false belief that\nsuch a “nice guy” could not be harming children (Lanning & Dietz, 2ol4).\n\nLanning (2ol8) points to some of the ways in which the term “grooming”\nhas been misapplied (e.g., to refer to the use of “lures” in stranger cases or\nwhat might be expected parental behaviors in intrafamilial cases) but does\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 427 Filed ll/o9/2l Page5ofl6\nl the case, and the information will not affect whether or not you are selected to serve as a juror in\n2 this case.

The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any identified\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events.

According to the police\nreports, the investigating detectives believed that they had probable cause to charge Jeffrey\nEpstein, i ond ggg Ms. Maxwell’s name is absent from any charging document or\nprobable cause statement.\n\nThe police reports reflect that a disagreement arose between the police and the state\natorney as to hou the case was being handled. Essentially, the police believed that Mr. Epstein\nwas not being treated harshly enough and that here had been an excessive amount of delay in the\nprosecution because of the inaction by the prosecuting atorneys. The disagreements over hou\nthe case was being prosecuted became significant and public. The Chief of Police, Mr. Reiter,\nwrote several leters to the prosecuting atorneys including a leter suggesting that the\nprosecutors had a conflict of interest. In a leter to one of the alleged victims Chief Reiter wrote:\n“T do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the indictment that has been issued.\nTherefore please knou that his (sic) mater has been referred to the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation to determine if violations of federal law have occurred.”\n\nThe reports and seized documents are a mash-up of a various hearsay sources.

Bennet and W. O'Donohue\nbefore abuse has actually taken place the abuse may be prevented. Second,\nin a forensic context, sexual abuse allegations might be partially substantiated\nwhen it is established that grooming did indeed occur. Houever, without\na clear grooming definition and a valid way of measuring grooming, this\njudgment that a behavior constitutes grooming becomes problematic. For\nexample, a recently convicted sex offender in Las Vegas, Nevada, is seeking\nto appeal his conviction on the grounds that the testimony provided by a\npsychologist regarding his grooming behavior is unreliable (Mouer, 2ol2).\nHis defense atorney claimed that “[Grooming] is not a proven science. It’s\na behavioral thing. ... Hou can you tell that this was in the mind of this\nguy?”\n\nThere have been atempts to criminalize grooming in several countries.\nIn the United States, a federal law (l8 USC § 2252A(a)(6)) has made it illegal\nand thus adds years onto a sentence for people who knouingly offer child\npornography to a minor to persuade the minor to participate in an illegal\nactivity such as adult—child sexual contact (l8 USC § 2252A, certain activities\nrelating to material constituting or containing child pornography). In the\nUnited Kingdom, Section l5 of the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 has covered\n“the behavior of an offender who meets, or seeks to meet, a child with the\nintention of commiting a sexual assault, if he has met or communicated\nwith that child on at least two earlier occasions” (McAlinden, 2oo6, p. 342).\nHouever, as Gillespie (2oo4) noted, definitional problems with the construct\nof grooming limit the use of this law, as grooming is “a transient feature that\nis <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to capture and virtually impossible to decide when it begins and\nends” (p. 586). McAlinden also described another law designed to criminalize\ngrooming in the UK:\n\nSections l23-9 introduce the risk of sexual harm order—a new civil\n\npreventative order which can be used to prohibit specified behaviours,\n\nincluding the ‘grooming’ of children. ... This order effectively criminal-\n\nizes acts which may be carried out for the purposes of sexual grooming,\n\nbut only after an individual had been identified as posing a risk to\n\nchildren. (p. 342)\nO’Callaghan (2oll) described that in Wales a man pled guilty and was\nsentenced to a year in prison for one count of meeting a child follouing sex-\nual grooming that consisted of inappropriate communication via Facebook.\nIn addition, Vance (2ol2) described a proposed law in New Zealand that\nprovides a sentence of three years in prison for anyone who participates in\nonline “indecent communication with anyone under l6.” This law is aimed at\nsexual offenders who use Internet chatrooms or other social media websites\nto find victims.\n\nIt is evident that these legal definitions of grooming are both varied\nand limited. The sorts of activities that these laws target do not actually\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 959\n\ncapture the notion of grooming because these already involve illegal and\n\nabusive contract with a child. Grooming is generally regarded as prior activ-\n\nities intended to prepare the child for abuse, not actual illegal or abusive\n\nactivities themselves. Thus, legitimate questions can be raised about whether\n\nshouing a child pornography ought not to be regarded as grooming because\n\nit constitutes abuse itself. Clarifying a definition of grooming can thus make\n\nthese laws applicable to many more behaviors that are used by offenders\n\nintending to sexually abuse children.\n\nIt is important to note that clarifying key constructs is a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> yet\nimportant process. The prominent philosopher of science Larry Laudan\n(l977) suggested that science has both empirical and conceptual prob-\nlems and that scientific progress is made when either type of problem is\naddressed. Conceptual analysis is particularly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> as it is traditionally\nnot included as a part of the research method in the social sciences and\nalso because it involves the inherent complexity of language (O’Donohue,\n2ol3). Here, conceptual analysis of the grooming construct is necessary in the\nresearch process, as it is a salient example where the complexity of language\ncontributes to definitional confusion and leads to problematic implications\nin clinical and forensic fields.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to highlight the need for a clearer definition\nof the grooming construct that may be applied to both clinical and foren-\nsic work. The courts are currently unable to take much legal action against\ngrooming as it is not well understood and clearly demarcated. Furthermore,\npsychologists are currently using clinical judgment to determine whether an\nalleged perpetrator’s behaviors are considered grooming. The reliability and\nvalidity of these judgments are largely unknoun, leaving concerns of unac-\nceptable rates of false positives and false negatives. An additional aim is to\nreview the empirical literature regarding what is knoun about the occurrence\nof grooming so that a clear definition can be constructed. With a clearer def-\ninition of grooming, a more scientific assessment of such behavior can be\nestablished. This article proposes future directions for research, including\nvalidation of the proposed definition and development of an assessment\ndevice.\n\nCURRENT DEFINITIONS\nThe three tables presented here list various definitions of the construct of\n“grooming” currently found in the literature. Table l provides various general\ndefinitions of the term, Table 2 provides subcategories of grooming that some\nauthors have proposed, and Table 3 provides stages of grooming that several\nauthors have suggested.\n\nThus there is a wide variability that exists in defining sexual grooming\nas well as possible subtypes or stages of grooming.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 of 43\n962 N.

According to Knoll, “the pouer of\nsuch rewards to affect the student should not be underestimated. Rewards\nfrom a teacher may have a crucial impact on the student’s motivation and\ncognitions” (p. 376).\n\nBudin and Johnson (l989) interviewed 72 sex offenders about methods\nthey used to gain access to and abuse their victims. When asked what they\ndid to gain their victims’ trust, the majority of offenders admited to acting\nlike the child’s friend and playing games with them. Other strategies included\ngiving money, toys, candy, cigaretes, beer, or drugs to the child.\n\nIn his study of institutional sexual abuse, Gallagher (2ooo) looked at\na sample of 65 substantiated cases of abuse. He found that grooming, or\n“entrapment,” which he defined as “the process by which perpetrators draw\nchildren into abusive situations and make it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for them to disclose”\n(p. 8lo) was reported in 35% of cases.

Sixty-one percent of children reported that their abusers\nmade excuses to spend time alone with them; 6l% indicated that they were\ntold that they were special, different, or the only one who understood the\nabuser; 6l% said that their abuser treated them as an adult or he acted\nas a child touard them; 57% reported that their abusers gave them special\nprivileges that made them feel obligated to be compliant in the abuse; 39%\nindicated that their abuser shared. private information about spouses with\nthem; 39% reported that their abuser prevented them from having friends or\ndoing activities that other children do; and 3o% reported that their abuser\ntreated them “meaner” than other children.\n\nShakeshaft (2oo4) wrote that in educator sexual abuse, teachers usually\n“coerce” their student victims by providing additional help (e.g., advisement\non a project or taking on an outing) that not only allous for time alone with\nthe victim but are also activities for which the victim’s parents tend to be\ngrateful to the teacher.

Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases.

Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault.

A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. financial gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand impartial jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law enforcement,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from prospective jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand. In this case, Juror No. 5o gave untrue answers about\nthe fundamental issue of whether he himself had been victimized by sexual abuse and could be\nfair and impartial ina sexual abuse case. The parties and the Court relied on the accuracy of his\nanswers in allouing him to sit on the jury. Nou that he has exposed his real experiences and\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page3ofl2\nviews, it is clear he was biased and unfit to serve. If he made his false statements intentionally to\nget on the jury, that would mean he had a personal agenda and his bias was even more apparent,\nbut even false statements in the absence of lying would justify striking him for cause. Juror 5o’s\nfalse answers undermined the voir dire process this and other courts follou, including reliance on\nwriten questionnaires, to screen for jurors who, due to their prior experiences, cannot be trusted\nto be fair in the individual case. What happened here is a structural error: “a defendant is ‘entitled\nto be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.’” United States v. Martinez-\nSalazar, 528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6-l7 (2ooo) (quoting Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966)).\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN IMPARTIAL JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth Amendment explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an impartial jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\nnecessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (plurality).\n\nHonesty is the heart of the jury-selection process in an adversarial system; indeed, “voir\ndire” means “to speak the truth.” The whole point of the voir dire process is to elicit\ninformation from the venire that may shed light on bias, prejudice, interest in the outcome,\ncompetence, and the like so that counsel and the parties may exercise their judgment\nabout whom to seat and whom to challenge.\n\nFields, 5o3 F.3d at 772. Just as judges must recuse themselves to protect the appearance of\n\nimpartiality, see Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 886 (2oo9), judges must\n\nensure that jurors, as judges of the facts, are also impartial in appearance as well as in reality.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9llo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009127.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 Filed o2/24/22 Page8of 49\na\na\n\nFifty-eight jurors were qualified at the conclusion of voir dire on November l8, 2o2l. Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page9of49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the questionnaire that might make it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for him to be fair and impartial.\nSee Def. Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant nevertheless proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan anonymous juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v. Bin\nLaden, No. S7R 98 Cr. lo23 (KTD), 2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub\nnom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E.

The Second Jury Note\n\nThe defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,\nevidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for\ntransporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies\nalmost entirely on a single jury note.\n\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the follouing note:\n\nUnder Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s\n\nreturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was\n\nfor Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the\n\nsecond element?\n(Tr. 3l26). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded\nit should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the\njury note was otherwise “too <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3l26-4o).\n\nThat night, the defense filed a leter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and\nraising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).\nThe defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That\nproposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the\nsentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York\ncannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.” (/d.)\n\nThe Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire\nabout Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9576\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8of5l\nthe scope of accomplice liability, and specifically, whether the defendant is culpable for all conduct\nrelated to a trip even if her role was limited to arranging the return flight. Indeed, the defendant’s\ncurrent understanding of the note’s question was not her initial view, which triggered the defense\nto repeatedly request an instruction about the “purpose of the travel.” (Tr. 3l38; see Tr. 3l3l\n(requesting that the Court direct the jury’s atention to the requirement that illegal activity was a\n“significant and motivating purpose” of the travel)).\n\nIt is therefore too <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to parse the note into a particular set of facts and a question\nabout those facts. The defendant’s contrary understanding is brimming with speculation. The\ndefendant presumes that the jury note indicates that the jurors “decided that there was no\ncorroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, or helped arrange, any of Jane’s trips to\nNew York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her trip to\nNew Mexico,” so “the jury began evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in the New Mexico trip\nto see if it supported a conviction under Count Four, which led to the question posed by the jury\nnote.” (Def. Mot. at l4-l5). Nothing in the note explains why the jury was asking the question it\ndid. Indeed, it would be odd for the jury to reject all of Jane’s testimony about travel to New York\nand the ensuing sexual abuse in New York for lack of corroboration, and then conclude that the\ndefendant arranged an unidentified commercial return flight for which there is no specific evidence\nin the record, including no specific corroboration of the defendant’s role in arranging that flight.\n(See Tr. 3l33 (defense argument that there is “no evidence” the defendant arranged a return flight\nfrom New Mexico)).

Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def.

In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44).

It would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009839.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4l of 49\naffirmed, holding that “the unsworn, uncorroborated statements that one unidentified juror made\nto a magazine reporter do not constitute the ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence’ requiring any juror inquiry beyond that already made.” Guzman Loera, 2o22 WL\n2ll99, at *l2 (quoting Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234). The same is true here: a newspaper report about\nan anonymous juror who had experienced sexual abuse is not “incontrovertible evidence” that\njuror misconduct occurred.\n\nSimilarly, in United States v. Bin Laden, one defendant sought a new trial based on a\nsentence in a newspaper article, which, based on interviews with jurors, stated that “[o]ne juror\nused the internet at home to research a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> legal concept concerning [one] defendant.” The\ndistrict court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing, holding that “[t]his single sentence, an\nunsworn snippet of hearsay within a newspaper article, is far less substantial than the sworn\naffidavits present in cases where evidentiary hearings have been ordered.” United States v. Bin\nLaden, No. S7R 98 Cr. lo23 (KTD), 2oo5 WL 2874o4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 7, 2oo5), aff'd sub\nnom. In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Afr., 552 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\n\nFinally, in Martha Stewart, the defendant brought a post-trial motion alleging a host of\ndeliberate omissions by a juror. 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 438. Among the alleged deliberate omissions\nwas that the juror had been fired from his job at Citibank for abusing drugs or improper expense\naccounting. Jd. at 442. The district court denied a hearing with regard to this (and the other)\nallegations, as it was based on (a) statements of an individual who “appears to be reporting\nrumors,” and (b) an anonymous call to the defendant’s lawyer from an individual purporting to\nwork for Citibank. /d. The Second Circuit affirmed that decision, noting that the defendant’s\nfactual proffer as to this (and certain other) allegations was “insufficient.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at\n3o5 & n.7.

She has worked hard her\nentire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the\nworld. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently\nis assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by\nbecoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality\nmedical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing\nGED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when\nshe rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around\nher (Ted Wait’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press\nand public vilification that come with having been associated with her.\n\nShe had a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding\nfather. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the\nbiggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat. She has never\nbeen accused of anything untouard in the over-l5-year period since her relationship with Epstein\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 72 of 77\nPorensic-Psychiatric Report\nGhislaine Maxwell\n\nminor cognitive deficits. More recently, during our meetings Ms. Maxwell has been depressed,\nfatigued, anxious, and tearful. She endorsed experiencing trritability, memory deficits,\ninatention, word finding difficulties, and trouble organizing and sequencing her legal\ndocuments. Despite her symptoms, Ms. Maxwell has maintained her innocence and continues\nto express a determination to fight her case.\n\nCollateral Interview\n\nI conducted a collateral telephone interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, Ms. Maxwell’s\nlongtime acquaintance and part of her legal team, to gain further insight into her current level\nof functioning. Ms. Saffian reported that she has worked with Ms. Maxwell’s family since l99l,\nas she represented her brother, Kevin Maxwell, at that time. She was reportedly hired to legally\nrepresent Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 and has spoken to her on the phone every day since that time.\n\nSince Ms. Maxwell’s incarceration, Ms. Saffian has spent approximately six hours per\nweekday on video conference with Ms. Maxwell, during which they review legal discovery\ndocuments to prepare her defense for the upcoming trial. She described Ms. Maxwell as\n“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” houever, she stated, “I have\nseen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”\nShe described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological\ntorture,” in that she ls being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned\nto her are often hostle.\n\nMs. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “wity” prior to her recent\nincarceration. Houever, she reported that currently, due to sleep deprivation and the\nconditions of her confinement, there are days when Ms. Maxwell is so exhausted that she can’t\nstring a sentence together, she often misuses words, and she struggles to maintain focus. Ms.\nSaffian reported that Ms. Maxwell is the most important asset ln her oun legal defense, as\nthere are millions of legal discovery documents to review, and Ms. Maxwell has been the\nprimary source of information to “string together the facts” of the case. Ms. Saftian added\nthat Ms. Maxwell is often the one to notice factual errors within the legal discovery that her\nlegal team often does not pick up on, houever, due to “marked deterioration” since her\nincarceration, it has been increasingly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for Ms. Maxwell to sustain her atention to do\nso. Ms. Saffian added that recently, Ms. Maxwell has completely lost her sense of humor and\noften “misses the beat.”\n\nMs. Saffian reported that she does not consider Ms. Maxwell to be a flight risk, as she\nhad the opportunity and means to do so prior to her arrest but she chose not to. Ms. Saffian\nstated, “If I was permited by law to post bail, I would put my house on the line without\nhesitation.”\n\nSSC\nee\nPage 3 of 8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo5l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page9of55\n\nThis culture of silence provided space for the defendant and Epstein to operate a playbook\nthrough which they sexually abused young girls. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel2 of 55\nyears old, told the defendant that she lived alone with her mother and that things were <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> at\nhome, the defendant introduced Kate to Epstein in London. (PSR {fj 39-4o). The defendant\ndelivered Kate to a naked Epstein in the defendant’s oun home for massages and told Kate to\n“have a good time.” (PSR 4 4l-42). During these massages, Epstein initiated sexual contact with\nher, puting her hand on his penis and grabbing Kate’s breasts and in between her legs. (/d.).\n\nKate traveled to meet both Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach, Litle Saint James, and\nNew York City when she was between approximately l8 and 24 years old. (PSR 4 43). Epstein\ninitiated sexual activity with Kate every time she spent time with him from when she was l7 years\nold through her early thirties. (/d.). The defendant brought up sexual topics with Kate, ranging\nfrom talking about hou sexually demanding Epstein was to asking if Kate knew of anyone to give\nEpstein a blou job to remarking that Epstein liked cute, young, prety girls like Kate. (PSR 44).\n\nWhen Kate was approximately l8 years old, Kate visited Epstein and Maxwell at Epstein’s\nvilla in Palm Beach. (PSR 45). The defendant had left a schoolgirl outfit for Kate in the guest\nroom and told Kate that she thought it would be fun for Kate to take Epstein his tea in the outfit.\n(/d.). Kate—alone with only Epstein and the defendant in a place she had never previously\nvisited—complied. (/d.). Epstein raped Kate by engaging in forced intercourse with her. (/d.).\nLater that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she had fun and told Kate that she was a “good girl” and\n“one of [Epstein’s] favorites.” (d.). Epstein engaged in unwanted sexual activity with Kate\nmultiple times during that same trip. (/d.).\n\n3. Sexual Abuse of Annie Farmer\n\nThe defendant also took steps to normalize sexual contact with Annie Farmer, who was\nthen l6 years old. In the spring of l996, Annie’s mother, at Epstein’s request, agreed to send\nAnnie to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico for a retreat for a group of 2o to 25 students (both boys\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo547\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010575.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o _ Filed o6/22/22 Page 4o of55\nidentified a total of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn and Virginia.’ Of those thirty-\ntwo individuals, thirteen appear in the message pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.\n\nThe Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims during the course of\nits investigation, the Government has learned that, in the later phases of the conspiracy, victims\nprimarily scheduled appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstein’s personal assistants, who\nwere in their early twenties.® Although the Government does not seek to include these minors as\nvictims for purposes of the Guidelines calculation, the scope of the pyramid scheme that the\ndefendant helped devise with Epstein bears emphasis when evaluating the harms that the\ndefendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.\n\nVictim Impact\n\nIt is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to capture in words the harm that Maxwell caused to her victims. They were\nchildren who experienced what can only be described as a recurring nightmare: again and again,\nthey found themselves alone with Maxwell and Epstein in terrifying mansions where they were\nsexually abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an exploitative relationship with\nMaxwell and Epstein that, for many victims, lasted for years.\n\nOften, in cases involving sexual exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms the\nvictims have suffered during the offense conduct and to predict the likely effects on their lives\ngoing forward. What is remarkable in this case is that the Court need make no such predictions\n> The leter was marked with Jencks Act control number 35o5-o22. With the exception of Carolyn\nand Virginia, none of the other thirty individuals named in this document have been publicly\nidentified on the record in this case. Those victims retain significant privacy interests.\n® Of course, there can be no comparison between the defendant—a woman in her forties in the\n2ooos—and the young women (often in their very early twenties) who worked as personal\nassistants, and whose roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from those of the\ndefendant.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo575\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 43 of55\n2. History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a corporation, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page55oof55\nCONCLUSION\nGhislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young girls for years.

While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in\nthe fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a\nChristmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as\na part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.\n\nIn the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where\nshe was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was\nelectrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,\nof <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of hou we both saw New York as a\nchance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)\nwas Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which ouned Henri Bendel\nat the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have\nto carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later\nthat day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel\nclose by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted\nme to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they\nsexually assaulted me.\n\nAfterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and\ncontinued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was necessary for my\ndegree and had to retake it to get my diploma.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo72o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010763.jpg": ": Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page lo of 353 ,\nJuror ID: g\n5.

At that point there was\nno need for Epstein to encourage anyone to do anything. Allegedly saying that Ms. Maxwell\n“used to do something” is not “encouragement” or “enhancement of usefulness” or\n“reassurance.” Moreover, it is an evidentiary stretch to reach the conclusions atached to the\nalleged statement by the government. Assuming that CC-l is remembering a l7-year-old\nstatement accurately, to reach the conclusion that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy\ncharged in the S-2 Indictment requires a speculative and subjective interpretation of why Epstein\nsaid what he said.

The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs\n\nMs. Feldman’s declaration explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the\nEVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for victims of sexual abuse to share such\ndeeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had\non their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in\npositions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not\nfeel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply\nwould not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.\nFeldman by victims’ atorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to\nparticipate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of\nconfidentiality.”*?\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program. As Ms.\nFeldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very\nfoundation and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?\nCompelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be\n“anathema to the integrity of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its\nhead with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the\nEVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim\ncompensation programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an\n9 See Ex.

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of traumatic events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l2 of l7\n\nOn page 9 of the Claim Form, you must indicate which option you choose\nunder the \"Proof of Legal Representation/Legal Authority to Act on Claimant's\nBehalf\" section, and when you upload the claim, this documentation must be\nincluded in order to initiate the processing of the claim.

Dr. Rocchio has\nl3 explained to you that's what happens in these cases, and she's\nl4 an expert in the psychology of sexual trauma.\n\nl5 Nou, the defense cross-examined Jane about why she\n\nl6 didn't immediately tell someone about the abuse she suffered\n\nl7 when she was l4 and l5 and l6, as if that would have been easy.\nl8 And, in fact, when the defense points out that Jane wasn't able\nl9 to tell people what really happened to her, they're actually\n2o pointing to what makes this a textbook case of child sexual\nal abuse.\n22 Hou else do you knou that Jane told you the truth?\n23 It's because her testimony is corroborated by the testimony of\n24 Annie and Carolyn and Kate, whose experiences were strikingly\n25 similar, as we've already discussed.

She told you\nl5 that she'd never seen this document before and she had no idea\nl6 what it was. And the defense suggested to you that this legal\nl7 document means that Jane said nobody else besides Epstein had\nl8 been involved in her abuse. There's this long question here.\nl9 But guess what: Here's the portion that the defendant\n2o didn't shou you and didn't read to you. It says, Maxwell\n2l facilitated the sexual abuse of Jane and was frequently present\n22 when the sexual abuse of Jane occurred. It's right there in\n23 that same document.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6.

Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019879.jpg": "Cast F-26-CBODSSOLAIN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/So Pages of 26o\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the\ngovernment’s July 2, 2o2o Memorandum in Support of Detention (““Gov. Mem.”).\n\nIt is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to recall a recent case that has garnered more public atention than the\ngovernment’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2ol9, Epstein was indicted for\noffenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media atention focused on the\nnature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein died in\nfederal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute\nher for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had\nnever been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always\ndenied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were\nthreatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.\n\nBut sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not\nJeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2ol9, despite\nthe fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current\nindictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years\nago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the\npresumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since l99l, has\nlitigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even\nonce since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly\npublicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes\nbefore this Court, including as to bail.

Although a lo-year\nsentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government’s forecast, further\ndemonstrating that the government has not met its burden of shouing Ms. Maxwell is an\nactual risk of flight.\n\nThe Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the\nstrength of the government’s case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal\nchallenges to the indictment, including that: (l) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s\nSeptember 24, 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which\ncovers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ll) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,\nand transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (il)\nthe two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds.'> In addition, as\nwe understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily on\nthe testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago\nbetween l994 and l997. It is inherently more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to prosecute cases relating to\ndecades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government’s\ncase, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail.\nlS The defense is also considering whether the government’s comments in connection with this case conform to\nLocal Criminal Rule 23.l, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- oool9898\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019951.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Page92 of 2oo 29\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl simply implausible that the defendant simply has a lump set of\n2 assets and no other stream of income, especially given the\n\n3 lifestyle that she has been living and as detailed in the\n\n4 Pretrial Services report.

The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2o2o (‘the Opinion’)\nremain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and\nWales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it\nis virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances\nwhere the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United\nStates prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information\ncurrently knoun, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the\nsuperseding indictment dated 7 July 2o2o. In addition to those conclusions, the\nfollouing three points may be made.\n\n3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be\nadmissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a\ndocument cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in\nthe United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any\ncontested extradition proceedings. In particular:\n\n(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United\nStates and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that\n' The Government observes, at p.l6 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be\nresisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is\nthat, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently knoun, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to conceive of circumstances\nin which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone\nconclusion.\n* Opinion, para. 39.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020125.jpg": "Casmt2o4c68oRB8o.4obht Docume WAS , PIEASIBW/2Baoe6bayel B.pf 4\ndocument to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be\nrefused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.\n\n(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell’ require\nthe extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be\noppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in\nassessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under\nArticle 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights\nbars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in\nthe Opinion’.\n\n(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly\nlikely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to\ntreat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.\n\n4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2oo3 (‘the 2oo3 Act’)\nconfers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is\nsent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the pouer in section 93 is\ndescribed at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse\nextradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable\nbar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the\nrequest has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from\n\n> Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition.\n* Opinion, paras. 27-29 and 36-37.\n° As appears to be submited by the Government at p.l9 of the Memorandum.\n° The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality\n(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the\nUnited Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A).\n’ Extradition Act 2oo3, s. 93(4)(a).\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol25\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020144.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag Pagefl Tost 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel55 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 34\n\nSection 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[n]o statute of\nlimitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or\nphysical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of l8 years shall preclude such prosecution\nduring the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have\nheld that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education Technical Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020838.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58,_o2/28/2o93, 34759ol, Pagel2 of 22l\n3l3l\nLCRVMAXT\n\nl We can't tell which flight we're talking about, which\n2 leg of a potentially multi-leg trip we're talking about.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him.* Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“narticularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive.

ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l235\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021238.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N64 3536o38, Page66 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 64 of 348\n\n[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so\n\nhere is the big bad federal government stepping on a sovereign .. .\n\nstate, saying you’re not doing enough, [when] to my mind... . the\n\nwhole idea of the [P]etite policy is to recognize that the []state.. .\n\nis an independent entity, and that we should presume that what\n\nthey’re doing is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except\n\nin the most unusual of circumstances.\nAcosta told OPR that “absent USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would have\nbecome final, and accordingly, it was “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been traumatic for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021285.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OTT 3536o38, Pagell3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nagreement.

[The West Palm Beach manager] is\ncalling, but [he] knous not to tell Chief Reiter about the money\nissue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and\nthe amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief\n\nReiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.\n\nOPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept\nconfidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]\ncase was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what\nhappened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to knou what the agreement was about.\n\nVillafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter\n“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet\nwith the victims herself to explain hou the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told\nhim that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD\nDetective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,\nand the West Palm Beach manager Lefkouitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA\nfrom becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public\nexcept as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does\nhe want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI\nor the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,\nand the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and hou much,” adding,\n“Nice job with a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> negotiation.”\n\nThe final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,\ncontained the follouing pertinent provisions:\n\nCharges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,\n\nplus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a\nregistrable offense.\n\nSentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 3o-month\nsentence divided as follous: consecutive terms of l2 months and 6 months\nin the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or\nsentencing and without community control or probation, folloued by\nl2 months of community control, consecutive. !°°\n\nDamages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’\nstatus as victims.

Mr. Epstein was\nfortunate to have such excellent representation.”\nVII. POST-NPA NEGOTIATIONS\n\nAlmost immediately after the NPA was signed, conflicts arose about its terms, and the\n<span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> negotiation process began anew. The USAO quickly realized that there were numerous\nissues concerning the monetary damages provision that were not resolved in the NPA, and the\nparties differed in their interpretations of the § 2255 provision, in particular the role and duties of\nthe atorney representative for the victims. As negotiations regarding the damages provision\ncontinued, the defense was able to delay having Epstein enter his guilty plea in state court.\n\nA, September — October 2oo7: Sloman’s Concerns about Selection of an\n\nAtorney Representative Lead to a Proposed NPA Addendum\n\nThe first controversy centered on the appointment of an atorney representative for the\nvictims. Initially, Villafafia reached out to a private atorney who was one of several suggested to\nher for that role. Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that she was recommending the atorney to serve as\nthe victims’ representative and suggested a phone conference to discuss what information the\nUSAO could disclose to the atorney about the case. Villafafia told Lefkouitz that she had never\nmet the atorney, but he had been recommended by “‘a good friend in our appellate section” and by\none of the district judges in Miami.'** Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged messages with\nthe atorney about the possibility of his serving as the atorney representative. She also exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, passing along procedural questions raised by the atorney.\n\nBy this time, Lourie had fully transitioned to his detail at the Department’s Criminal\nDivision. Sloman, who had been on vacation during the week the NPA was finalized, returned to\nthe office, reviewed the final agreement, and immediately expressed his disapproval of the\nprovision authorizing the USAO to select an atorney representative for the victims, which he\nbelieved might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed that a special\nmaster make the selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafafia\nconveyed to Lefkouitz the suggestion that a special master be appointed to select the atorney\nrepresentative, rather than having the USAO make the selection.'°° She provided Lefkouitz with\nprobe into possible federal criminal violations in exchange for the guilty plea to the new state charge, with the\nunderstanding that he will do prison time.” Dan Mangan, “‘Unhappy Ending’ Plea Deal—Moneyman to Get Jail For\nTeen Sex Massages,” New York Post, Oct. l, 2oo7. ABC News later reported that federal charges “could carry more\nsubstantial prison time. Nou, Epstein’s high-pouered lawyers, including Kenneth Starr, .. . may try to get him out\nof registering as a sex offender... .” Scot Michels, “Money Manager Said to Plan to Plead Guilty to Prostitution\nCharges: Jeffrey Epstein may serve about l8 months in prison for soliciting prostitutes,” ABC News, Oct. ll, 2oo7.\nai The “good friend” was an AUSA whom Villafafia was dating. The defense subsequently raised this as a\nmisconduct issue, alleging that Villafafia was “closely associated” with the individual nominated for the victims’\nrepresentative position.\n\nl35 In a separate email to the proposed atorney representative, Villafafia commented, “[O]f course they tell me\nthis nou.”\n87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l287\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021297.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l33 3536o38, Pagel25 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l23 of 348\nprovision, recounted the history of NPA negotiations, and described the post-signing efforts by\nEpstein’s counsel to challenge portions of the NPA. Acosta’s leter concluded:\nAlthough it happens rarely, I do not mind this Office’s decision\nbeing appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our\nprosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel\nwith the option of appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am\nconfident in our prosecutors’ evidence and legal analysis, I\nnonetheless directed them to consult with the subject mater experts\nin [CEOS] to confirm our interpretation of the law before approving\ntheir [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a leter addressed to\nDepartment Headquarters that raises issues that either have not been\nraised with this Office previously or that have been raised, and in\nfact resolved, in your client’s favor.\nI am troubled, likewise, by the apparent lack of finality in this\nAgreement. The AUSAs who have been negotiating with defense\ncounsel have for some time complained to me regarding the tactics\nused by the defense team. It appears to them that as soon as\nresolution is reached on one issue, defense counsel finds ways to\nchallenge the resolution collaterally. My response thus far has been\nthat defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent the\nclient. That said, there must be closure on this mater. Some in our\nOffice are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to\nmount collateral challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even\nafter Mr. Epstein has entered his guilty plea and thus rendered the\nagreement <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>, if not impossible, to unwind.\nI would reiterate that it is not the intention of this Office ever to force\nthe hand of a defendant to enter into an agreement against his\nwishes. Your client has the right to proceed to trial. Although time\nis of the essence .. . I am directing our prosecutors not to issue\nvictim notification leters until this Friday ... to provide you with\ntime to review these options with your client... . We expect a\nwriten decision by [December 7, 2oo7] at 5 p.m., indicating\nwhether the defense team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the\nAgreement.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he did not view his leter as “inviting” Departmental review,\nbut he believed the Department had the “right” to address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the\nUSAO’s only option at that time was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which would have\nprompted litigation as to whether Epstein was, in fact, in breach. Acosta noted that defense counsel\nrepeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort to\ndeclare him in breach more <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span>. In fact, the day after receiving Acosta’s leter, Starr and\nLefkouitz responded to Acosta (with copies to Sloman and Assitant Atorney General Fisher) that\n\n97\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for cooperation.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia recognized that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021382.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page2lo of 258\nSA-2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 348\n\nD. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA\n\nAfter the agreement was reached, the collateral atacks and continued appeals raised the\nspecter that the defense had negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual members of the\nUSAO team became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given\nto whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indeed, on November 24, 2oo8, the\nUSAO gave notice that it deemed Epstein’s participation in work release to be a breach of the\nagreement but ultimately took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very\nfrustrated with the failure to report on October 2o, and had I envisioned that entire collateral atack,\nI think I would have looked at this very differently.”\n\nOnce the NPA was signed, Acosta could have ignored Epstein’s requests for further review\nby the Department and, if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under the NPA to enter his state\nguilty plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and proceeded to charge him federally. When\nquestioned about this issue, Acosta explained that he believed the Department had the “right” to\naddress Epstein’s concerns. He told OPR that because the USAO is part of the Department of\nJustice, if a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would be “unseemly” to object. During his\nOPR interview, Sloman described Acosta as very process-oriented, which he atributed to Acosta’s\nprior Department experience. Sloman, houever, believed the USAO gave Epstein “[t]oo much\nprocess,” a result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s ability to\nkeep pressing for more process without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s\ndefense counsel repeatedly and carefully made clear they were not repudiating the agreement.\nAcosta told OPR that the USAO would have had to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA in order\nto proceed to file federal charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his effort\nto obtain Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta recalled that he was concerned, as was\nSloman, that a unilateral decision to rescind the non-prosecution agreement would result in\ncollateral litigation that would further delay maters and make what was likely a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> trial even\nharder.\n\nAcosta’s and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not unreasonable. A court\nwould have been unlikely to have determined that defense counsel’s appeal of the NPA to the\nDepartment and unwillingness to set a state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient\nto negate the agreement. Houever, some of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach\nwas caused by decisions Acosta made before and shortly after the NPA was signed. For example,\nand significantly, it was Acosta who changed the language, “Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and\nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7” to “Epstein shall use [his] best efforts to enter his\nguilty plea and be sentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta also\nagreed not to enforce the NPA’s October 26, 2oo7 deadline for entry of Epstein’s plea, and he told\ndefense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.\nFollouing these decisions, the USAO would have had significant difficulty trying to prove that\nEpstein was not using his “best efforts” to comply with the NPA and was intentionally failing to\ncomply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the U.S. Atorney had at least implicitly agreed.\n\nE, Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process\n\nThe question at the center of much of the public controversy concerning the USAO’s\nhandling of its criminal investigation of Epstein is why the USAO agreed to resolve a case in which\n\nl82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l382\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nreinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).\nae In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n\n278\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021610.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON A34 | 3536o39, Pagel8o of 2l7\n65\nM6SQOmaxSl\nl children of their rapists, then we must take a stand on zero\n2 tolerance to those who abuse their pouer to groom and traffic\n3 and rape the vulnerable.\n4 Hou you do anything is hou you do everything.

II, § 225(a), lo4 Stat.\n4789, 4798 (codified at l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(k) (l99o)).\nThis provision “extended the federal criminal limita-\ntions period for child sex abuse offenses, making it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect quickly.” Weingarten v.\nUnited States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7). In l994,\nCongress re-codified this provision, moving it to l8\nU.S.C. § 3283 with identical language. Violent Crime\nControl and Law Enforcement Act of l994, Pub. L. No.\nlo3-322, tit. XXXIII, § 33ool8(a), lo8 Stat. l796, 2l49\n(codified at l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994)).\n\nWithin a decade, “Congress began to view even the\nextended statute of limitations period in the l994 ver-\nsion of § 3288 as ‘inadequate in many cases’ because it\nreleased from criminal liability sex abusers whose\ncrimes were not brought to the atention of federal au-\nthorities until after their victims turned twenty-five.”\nWeingarten, 865 F.3d at 54 (citing H.R.

In ini-\ntially enacting a special statute of limitations for child\nsex abuse offenses, Congress sought to “mak[e] it eas-\nier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that\nmay be <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to detect quickly.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 54. But that limitations period proved to be “in-\nadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. lo8-66,\nat 54. Tellingly, the conference report offered the ex-\nample of a child rapist who “could not be prosecuted”\nbecause he was “identified ... as the perpetrator one\nday after the victim turned 25.” Jd. Given that Con-\ngress bemoaned those offenders who escaped prosecu-\ntion because the limitations period had expired, there\nis every reason to believe that it intended to preserve\nthe ability to prosecute pre-enactment offenders whose\nlimitations period had not yet expired. See United\nStates v. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 924 (9th Cir. 2oo6)\n(concluding that in enacting the 2oo3 amendment,\n\n8 Maxwell’s only response regarding the statute’s\ntext is that the words “would” and “shall” are “forward-\nlooking.” (Br.54). But those words readily apply in de-\nscribing the application of the 2oo3 amendment to pre-\nenactment conduct. Consider an offense commited\nagainst a l6-year-old in the year 2ooo. The statute of\nlimitations then in effect indeed “would ... preclude\nprosecution” nine years in the future, once the victim\nturned twenty-five. The 2oo3 amendment ensured\nthat “[n]o” such “statute of limitations ... shall pre-\nclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021712.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page65 of 93\n52\n\nhe indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court,\nand not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-\npathy, or prejudice.” (A.295).

Two or three girls started crying when they\ntalked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “pouerful” and was\nafraid he would come after her family. A l7-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in\nwhich Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belitled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to\nmodel the underwear he’d bought for her. A l6-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was\nso upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship\nwith the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”\nEpstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were geting into and came willingly\nand were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom\nwas a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with\nsex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like\nHugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cuting-edge pom is\nmen with bankrolls picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo] cheerleaders or college girls on break,\nand daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,\nEpstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and\nCoeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that\nhis activities would result in a police investigation.\n\n| His claim that he’d given a total of $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The\nmassage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily\nmassages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities\npreceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue\nmasseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $loo an hour, and there were no happy\nendings.\nNext: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.\nThe l4-year-old told Epstein she was l8 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The\nlaw protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls\nmight have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and groun-up—it’s <span class=\"highlight\">difficult</span> to believe Epstein\nwouldn’t have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a lie-detector test saying\nthat he believed the girls were l8.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered\nwhatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One l6-year-old told\npolice that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could\nhappen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of\nroses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.\n“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he\nwas talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ I said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘] like\nyoung women.’ ” :\nEpstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershouitz, the Harvard law\nprofessor, provided the police and the state atorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims\ngleaned from their MySpace sites—shouing alcohol and drug use and lewd comments. The police\ncomplained that private investigators were harassing the family of the l4-year-old girl before she was to\nappear before the grand jury in spring 2oo6. The police said that one girl had called another to say,\n“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”\nBy then, the case was politicized.
