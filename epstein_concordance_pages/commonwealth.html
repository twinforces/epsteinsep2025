David Perry QC\n\nl.l. David Perry QC is a barrister and former head of chambers at 6K BW College Hill. From\nl99l to l997, he was one of the Standing Counsel to the Department of Trade and\nIndustry. From l997 to 2ool, he was Junior Treasury Counsel to the Croun at the Central\nCriminal Court and Senior Treasury Counsel from 2ool until 2oo6, when he ‘took silk’\n(i.e. was appointed Queen’s Counsel). He is a deputy High Court Judge and a judge of\nthe Court of Appeal of Jersey and Guernsey.\n\nl.2. Mr Perry prosecutes and defends and has extensive experience of extradition and mutual\nlegal assistance cases, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. He is a member of the\nEditorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and a joint editor of Blackstone’s Criminal\nPractice, a leading practitioners’ work.\n\n2. Extradition — Experience and Expertise\n\n2.l. Mr Perry is widely considered one of the UK’s pre-eminent extradition practitioners and\nis listed as such in the leading industry journals. He has acted on behalf of many overseas\ngovernments and appeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in the\nleading cases. He has acted as an expert consultant to the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> Secretariat on\ninternational co-operation and has advised overseas governments on the drafting and\nimplementation of their domestic legislation.\n\n3. Independent review of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements\n\n3.l. In 2oll/l2, together with Lord Justice Scot Baker and Anand Doobay, Mr Perry was\nappointed by the UK Government to conduct the Home Office’s Independent Review of\nthe UK’s extradition arrangements. The review formed the basis of changes to the\nExtradition Act 2oo3.\n\n3.2. The year-long review looked in detail at the follouing five areas:\n® the Home Secretary’s discretionary pouers to stop extradition.\n\ne the operation of the European Arrest Warrant, which deals with extradition\nrequests between European countries.\n\ne where a crime is mainly commited in the UK, whether the person should be tried\nin the UK.\n\ne whether the US-UK Extradition Treaty is unbalanced.\n\ne whether requesting countries should be required to provide sufficient evidence to\nprove an allegation.\n\n3.3. The report, totalling 488 pages and presented to the Home Secretary on 3o September\n2oll, made a series of recommendations in respect of the UK’s extradition arrangements.\nPart 7 of the report looked specifically at extradition arrangements between the United\nStates and United Kingdom under the 2oo3 UK-US Treaty on Extradition. It assessed the\neffectiveness of the tests used in each jurisdiction and laid out the authors’ observations\non the procedures under the treaty. Their conclusion was that the 2oo3 treaty was\noperating fairly and there was no basis to seek its renegotiation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ll4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003648.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 3o\nBLDS, LLC\nSPEECHES (Partial List)\nl.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\nUnited States Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe respectfully submit this leter to bring to the Court’s atention the recent decision by\nthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> of Pennsylvania v. William Henry Cosby\nJr., J-loo-2o2o (Jun. 3o, 2o2l), in which the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction and sentence\nbecause the District Atorney’s Office that prosecuted him failed to live up to its express promise\nnot to prosecute Mr. Cosby for the same crimes for which he was later convicted.! Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase presents a similar situation. As we argued in our supplemental pretrial motions currently\npending before the Court (Dkt. 293), the government has failed to abide by its promise not to\nprosecute Ms. Maxwell for the offenses for which she was immunized by the Epstein Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”). We submit that this decision provides support for Ms.\nMaxwell’s supplemental motion to dismiss Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the S2 Indictment\nfor violation of the NPA.\n\nIn Cosby, Andrea Constand alleged that Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her in his residence\nin January 2oo4. (Op. 4-5). Ms. Constand did not immediately report the assault to law\nenforcement authorities and continued to have contact with Mr. Cosby in the follouing months.\n(Id. at 5-7). In January 2oo5, approximately one year after the assault, Ms. Constand reported Mr.\nCosby’s conduct to the police. (/d. at 6). The Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office\ninvestigated the allegations, but then-District Atorney Bruce Castor determined that “there was\ninsufficient credible and admissible evidence” to bring criminal charges against Mr. Cosby.

Along with his top deputy prosecutor and experienced detectives,\nDistrict Atorney Castor thoroughly investigated Constand’s claim. In evaluating the\nlikelinood of a successful prosecution of Cosby, the district atorney foresaw difficulties\nwith Constand’s credibility as a witness based, in part, upon her decision not to file a\ncomplaint promptly. D.A. Castor further determined that a prosecution would be\nfrustrated because there was no corroborating forensic evidence and because testimony\nfrom other potential claimants against Cosby likely was inadmissible under governing\nlaws of evidence.

Factual and Procedural History\n\nIn the fall of 2oo2, Constand, a Canadian-born former professional basketball\nplayer, was employed as the Director of Basketball Operations at Temple University.

We granted allouance of appeal here as\nwell to consider the admissibility of that prior bad act evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 4o4(b).\nHouever, because our decision on the Castor declination issue disposes of this appeal,\nwe do not address the Rule 4o4(b) claim.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page ll of 8o\nwere illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as atempts by Constand\nand her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the\nauthorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A. Castor to conclude\nthat “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge\nagainst [] Cosby related to the Constand incident could be proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 6o.\n\nHaving determined that a criminal trial likely could not be won, D.A. Castor\ncontemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some\nform of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.\nTo aid Constand in that pursuit, “as the sovereign,” the district atorney “decided that [his\noffice] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then\nset off the chain of events that [he] thought as a Minister of Justice would gain some\njustice for Andrea Constand.” /d. at 63-64. By removing the threat of a criminal\nprosecution, D.A. Castor reasoned, Cosby would no longer be able in a civil lawsuit to\ninvoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for fear that his statements\ncould later be used against him by the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>. Mr. Castor would later testify that\nthis was his intent:\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution states that a person\n\nmay not be compelled to give evidence against themselves. So you can't\n\nsubpoena somebody and make them testify that they did something\n\nillegat—or evidence that would lead someone to conclude they did\n\nsomething illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to\n\nsanctions because you’re under subpoena.\n\nSo the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |\n\ndid in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby\n\nwould not be prosecuted no mater what. As a mater of law, that then made\n\nit so that he could not take the Fifth Amendment ever as a mater of law.\n\nSo | have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term\n\n“agreement,” but everybody has used the wrong word. | told [Cosby’s\n\natorney at the time, Walter] Phillips that | had decided that, because of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4823", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l2 of 8o\ndefects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to\n\nmake a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.\n\n| told him that | was making it as the sovereign <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> of\n\nPennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not\n\nbe alloued to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that\n\nAndrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of\n\nPennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was\n\nsubpoenaed, he would be required to testify.\n\nBut those two things were not connected one to the other. Mr. Cosby was\n\nnot geting prosecuted at all ever as far as | was concerned. And my belief\n\nwas that, as the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> and the representative of the sovereign,\n\nthat | had the pouer to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a\n\nmater of law Mr. Cosby would be unable to assert the Fifth Amendment in\n\na civil deposition.\n\n[Atorney] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than me—and\n\n| had 2o years on the job by that point—agreed with my legal assessment.\n\nAnd he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were\n\nrepresenting Mr. Cosby in the pending civil suit.\n\nId. at 64-66. Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district atorney further\nemphasized that it was “absolutely” his intent to remove “for all time” the possibility of\nprosecution, because “the ability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.”\nId. at 67.\n\nConsistent with his discussion with Atorney Phillips, D.A. Castor issued another\npress release, this time informing the public that he had decided not to prosecute Cosby.\nThe press release stated, in full:\n\nMontgomery County District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. has announced\n\nthat a joint investigation by his office and the Cheltenham Tounship Police\n\nDepartment into allegations against actor and comic Bill Cosby is\n\nconcluded.

Castor sent her an email, to which he atached his February l7, 2oo5 press\nrelease, stating the follouing:\n\nDear Risa,\n\n| certainly knou beter than to believe what | read in the newspaper, and |\n\nhave witnessed first hand your legal acumen. So you almost certainly knou\n\nthis already. |’m writing to you just in case you might have forgoten what\n\nwe did with Cosby back in 2oo5. Atached is my opinion from then.\n\nOnce we decided that the chances of prevailing in a criminal case were too\n\nremote to make an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve justice\n\nwas to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would have the best chance\n\nof prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby. With the agreement of [Atorney]\n\nPhillips and [Constand’s] lawyers, | wrote the atached as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending. Again, with the\n\nagreement of the defense lawyer and [Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally\n\nand specifically bound the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> that there would be no state\n\nprosecution of Cosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his\n\nFifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing him to\n\nsit for a deposition under oath. [Atorney Phillips] was speaking for Cosby’s\n\nside at the time, but he was in contact with Cosby’s civil lawyers who did\n\nnot deal with me directly that | recall. | only discovered today that [Atorney\n\nPhillips] had died. But those lawyers representing [Constand] civilly, whose\n\nnames | did not remember until | saw them in recent media accounts, were\n\npart of this agreement because they wanted to make Cosby testify. |\n\nbelieved at the time that they thought making him testify would solidify their\n\ncivil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>) to\n\npromise not to prosecute him. So in effect, that is what | did. | never made\n\nan important decision without discussing it with you during your tenure as\n\nFirst Assistant.\n\nKnouing the above, | can see no possibility that Cosby’s deposition could\n\nbe used in a state criminal case, because | would have to testify as to what\n\nhappened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression. | cannot\n\" Mr. Steele has since been elected District Atorney of Montgomery County.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4829", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l8 of 8o\nbelieve any state judge would allou that deposition into evidence, nor\nanything derived therefrom. In fact, that was the specific intent of all parties\ninvolved including the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> and the plaintiff's lawyers. Knouing\nthis, unless you can make out a case without that deposition and without\nanything the deposition led you to, | think Cosby would have an action\nagainst the County and maybe even against you personally. That is why |\nhave publically suggested looking for lies in the deposition as an alternative\nnou that we have learned of all these other victims we did not knou about\nat the time we had made the go, no-go decision on arresting Cosby. |\npublically suggested that the DA in California might try a common plan\nscheme or design case using [Constand’s] case as part of the res gestae in\ntheir case.

But | thought\nthe DA in California might have a shot because | would not have the pouer\nto bind another state’s prosecutor.\n\nSome of this, of course, is my opinion and using Cosby’s deposition in the\n\nCA case, might be a stretch, but one thing is fact: the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>,\n\ndefense, and civil plaintiffs lawyers were all in the agreement that the\n\natached decision from me stripped Cosby of this Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst self-incrimination, forcing him to be deposed. That led to Cosby\npaying [Constand] a lot of money, a large percentage of which went to her\nlawyers on a contingent fee basis. In my opinion, those facts will render\n\nCosby’s deposition inadmissible in any prosecution in Montgomery County\n\nfor the incident that occurred in January 2oo4 in Cheltenham Tounship.\n\nBruce\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh.

She requested a copy of any writen agreement not to\nprosecute Cosby. D.A. Castor replied with the follouing email:\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that we would not\n\nprosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers for [Constand] wanted and |\n\nagreed. The reason | agreed and the plaintiffs lawyers wanted it in writing\n\nis so that Cosby could not take the 5th Amendment to avoid being deposed\n\nor testifying. A sound strategy to employ. That meant to all involved,\n\nincluding Cosby’s lawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in\n\nthe civil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal prosecution for\n\nthe event we had him under investigation for in early 2oo5. | signed the\n\npress release for precisely this reason, at the request of [Constand’s]\n\ncounsel, and with the acquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo483o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 8o\ncomplete intent to bind the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> that anything Cosby said in the\n\ncivil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing him to be deposed\n\nand perhaps testify in a civil trial without him having the ability to “take the\n\n5th” | decided to create the best possible environment for [Constand] to\n\nprevail and be compensated.

Evidently, that strategy worked.\n\nThe atached, which was on leterhead and signed by me as District\n\nAtorney, the concept approved by [Constand’s] lawyers was a “writen\n\ndeclaration” from the Atorney for the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> there would be no\n\nprosecution based on anything Cosby said in the civil action.

D-7.\n\nDespite her predecessor’s concerns, D.A. Ferman and the investigators pressed\nforward, reopening the criminal case against Cosby. Members of the prosecutorial team\ntraveled to Canada and met with Constand, asking her to cooperate with their efforts to\nprosecute Cosby, even though she had specifically agreed not to do so as part of the civil\nsetlement. Investigators also began to identify, locate, and interview other women that\nhad claimed to have been assaulted by Cosby.\n\nNearly a decade after D.A.

Castor’s\npurported promise—made in his’ representative capacity on behalf of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>—that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> filed a\nresponse to the motion, to which Cosby replied.\n\nFrom February 2-3, 2ol6, the trial court conducted hearings on Cosby’s habeas\npetition, which it ultimately denied. Later, in its Pa.R.A.P. l925(a) opinion, the trial court\nexplained that “the only conclusion that was apparent” from the record “was that no\nagreement or promise not to prosecute ever existed, only the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.” Tr. Ct. Op. (“T.C.O.”), 5/l4/2ol9, at 62. In support of this conclusion, the trial\ncourt provided a lengthy summary of what it found to be the pertinent facts developed at\nthe habeas corpus hearing. Because our analysis in this case focuses upon the trial\ncourt’s interpretation of those testimonies, we reproduce that court’s synopsis here:\n\nOn January 24, 2oo5, then District Atorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr., issued a\n\nsigned press release announcing an investigation into Ms. Constand’s\n\nallegations. Mr. Castor testified that as the District Atorney in 2oo5, he\noversaw the investigation into Ms. Constand’s allegations. Ms. Ferman\nsupervised the investigation along with County Detective Richard Peffall\n\nand Detective Richard Schaffer of Cheltenham. Mr. Castor testified that “I\n\nassigned who | thought were our best people to the case. And | took an\n\nactive role as District Atorney because | thought | oued it to Canada to\n\nshou that, in America, we will investigate allegations against celebrities.”\n\nMr. Castor testified that Ms. Constand went to the Canadian police almost\n\nexactly one year after the alleged assault and that the case was ultimately\n\nreferred to Montgomery County. The lack of a prompt complaint was\nsignificant to Mr. Castor in terms of Ms. Constand’s credibility and in terms\n\nof law enforcement’s ability to collect physical evidence. He also placed\n\nsignificance on the fact that Ms. Constand told the Canadian authorities that\n\nshe contacted a lawyer in Philadelphia prior to speaking with them. He also\n\nreviewed Ms. Constand’s statements to police. Mr. Castor felt that there\n\nwere inconsistences in her statements. Mr. Castor did not recall press\n\nquotes atributed to him calling the case “weak” at a 2oo5 press conference.\nupon pre-arrest delay; and (3) a motion to disqualify the Montgomery County District\nAtorney’s Office.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - l9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4832", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 22 of 8o\nthe atmosphere or the legal conditions such that Mr. Cosby would never be\nalloued to assert the Fifth Amendment in the civil case.” He testified that\nshe did not come back to him with any objection from Ms. Constand’s\natorneys and that any objection from Ms. Constand’s atorneys would not\nhave matered anyway. He later testified that he did not have any specific\nrecollection of discussing his legal analysis with Ms. Ferman, but would be\nsurprised if he did not.\n\nMr. Castor testified that he could not recall any other case where he made\nthis type of binding legal analysis in Montgomery County. He testified that\nin a half dozen cases during his tenure in the District Atorney’s office,\nsomeone would atempt to assert the Fifth Amendment in a preexisting civil\ncase. The judge in that case would then call Mr. Castor to determine if he\nintended to prosecute the person asserting the privilege. He could confirm\nthat he did not and the claim of privilege would be denied. Mr. Castor was\nunable to name a case in which this happened.\n\nAfter making his decision not to prosecute, Mr. Castor personally issued a\nsecond, signed press release on February l7, 2oo5. Mr. Castor testified\nthat he signed the press release at the request of Ms. Constand’s atorneys\nin order to bind the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> so it “would be evidence that they could\nshou to a civil judge that Cosby is not geting prosecuted.” The press\nrelease stated, “After reviewing the above and consulting with County and\nCheltenham Detectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible and\nadmissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could\nbe sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.” Mr. Castor testified that this\nlanguage made it absolute that [Cosby] would never be prosecuted, “[s]o |\nused the present tense, [exists], .. . So I’m making it absolute. | said |\nfound that there was no evidence—there was insufficient credible and\nadmissible evidence in existence upon which any charge against [Cosby]\ncould be sustained. And the use of ‘exists’ and ‘could’ | meant to be\nabsolute.”\n\nThe press release specifically cautioned the parties that the decision could\nbe revisited, “District Atorney Castor cautions all parties to this mater that\nhe will reconsider this decision should the need arise.” He testified that\ninclusion of this sentence, warning that the decision could be revisited, in\nthe paragraph about a civil case and the use of the word “this,” was intended\nto make clear that it applied to the civil case and not to the prosecution. Mr.\nCastor testified that this sentence was meant to advise the parties that if\nthey criticized his decision, he would contact the media and explain that Ms.\nConstand’s actions damaged her credibility, which would severely hamper\nher civil case. He testified that once he was certain a prosecution was not\nviable “| operated under the certainty that a civil suit was coming and set up\nthe dominoes to fall in such a way that Mr. Cosby would be required to\ntestify.” He included the language “much exists in this investigation that\ncould be used by others to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4834", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 8o\nless than flatering light,” as a threat to Ms. Constand and her atorneys\nshould they atack his office. In a 2ol6 Philadelphia Inquirer article, in\nreference to this same sentence, Castor stated, “I put in there that if any\nevidence surfaced that was admissible | would revisit the issue. And\nevidently, that is what the D.A. is doing.” He testified that he remembered\nmaking that statement but that it referred to the possibility of a prosecution\nbased on other victims in Montgomery County or perjury.\n\nHe testified that the press release was intended for three audiences, the\nmedia, the greater legal community, and the litigants. He testified about\nwhat meaning he hoped that each audience would glean from the press\nrelease. He did not intend for any of the three groups to understand the\nentirety of what he meant. The media was to understand only that [Cosby]\nwould not be arrested. Lawyers would parse every word and understand\nthat he was saying there was enough evidence to arrest [Cosby] but that\nMr. Castor thought the evidence was not credible or admissible. The third\naudience was the litigants, and they were to understand that they did not\nwant to damage the civil case. He then stated that the litigants would\nunderstand the entirety of the press release, the legal community most of it\nand the press litle of it.\nMr. Castor testified that in November of 2ol4 he was contacted by the\nmedia as a result of a joke a comedian made about [Cosby]. Again, in the\nsummer of 2ol5 after the civil depositions were released, media\napproached Mr. Castor. He testified that he told every reporter that he\nspoke to in this time frame that the reason he had declined the charges was\nto strip Mr. Cosby of his Fifth Amendment privilege. He testified that he did\nnot learn the investigation had been reopened until he read in the paper that\n[Cosby] was arrested in December 2ol5, but there was media speculation\nin September 2ol5 that an arrest might be imminent.\nOn September 23, 2ol5, apparently in response to this media speculation,\nunprompted and unsolicited, Mr. Castor sent an email to then District\nAtorney Risa Vetri Ferman. His email indicated, in pertinent part,\n\nI’m writing you just in case you might have forgoten what we\n\ndid with Cosby back in 2oo5. .. Once we decided that the\n\nchances of prevailing in a criminal case were too remote to\n\nmake an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve\n\njustice was to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would\n\nhave the best chance of prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby.\n\nWith the agreement of [Atorney Phillips] and [Constand’s]\n\nlawyer, | wrote the atached [press release] as the ONLY\n\ncomment | would make while the civil case was pending.\n\nAgain, with the agreement of the defense lawyer and\n\n[Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally and specifically bound the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> that there would be no state prosecution of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4835", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 24 of 8o\nCosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth\nAmendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing\nhim to sit for a deposition under oath. ...

The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject\nto suppression.\nMs. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by leter of September 25,\n2ol5, requesting a copy of the “writen declaration” indicating that [Cosby]\nwould not be prosecuted. In her leter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first\n| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past\nWednesday. The first | heard of a writen declaration documenting the\nagreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/l5 and published today\nby Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with\ncounsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us\nwith any information about such an agreement.”\nMr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,\n\nThe atached Press Release is the writen determination that\n\nwe would not prosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers\n\nfor the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed\n\nand the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so Cosby could not\n\ntake the 5\" Amendment to avoid being deposed or\n\ntestifying. ... That meant to all involved, including Cosby’s\n\nlawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in the\n\ncivil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal\n\nprosecution for the event we had him under investigation for\n\nin early 2oo5. | signed the press release for precisely this\n\nreason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the\n\nacquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and complete\n\nintent to bind the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> that anything Cosby said in\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4836", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 25 of 8o\n\nthe civil case could not be used against him, thereby forcing\n\nhim to be deposed and perhaps testify in a civil trial without\n\nthe ability to “take the 5.” | decided to create the best\n\npossible environment for the Plaintiff to prevail and be\n\ncompensated.

[nJaturally, if a\n\nprosecution could be made out without using what Cosby\n\nsaid, or anything derived from what Cosby said, | believed\n\nthen and continue to believe that a prosecution is not\n\nprecluded.\nMr. Castor testified that he intended to confer transactional immunity upon\n[Cosby] and that his pouer to do so as the sovereign was derived from\ncommon law not from the statutes of Pennsylvania. In his final email to Ms.\nFerman, Mr. Castor stated, “Il never agreed we would not prosecute Cosby.”\nAs noted, Ms. Constand’s civil atorneys also testified at the hearing.\nDolores Troiani, Esq. testified that during the 2oo5 investigation, she had\nno contact with the District Atorney’s office and limited contact with the\nCheltenham Police Department. Bebe Kivitz, Esq. testified that during the\n2oo5 investigation she had limited contact with then-First Assistant District\nAtorney Ferman. The possibility of a civil suit was never discussed with\nanyone from the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> or anyone representing [Cosby] during the\ncriminal investigation. At no time did anyone from Cheltenham Police, or\nthe District Atorney's Office, convey to Ms. Troiani, or Ms. Kivitz, that\n[Cosby] would never be prosecuted. They learned that the criminal case\nwas declined from a reporter who came to Ms. Troiani’s office in the evening\nof February l7, 2oo5 seeking comment about what Bruce Castor had done.\nThe reporter informed her that Mr. Castor had issued a press release in\nwhich he declined prosecution. Ms. Troiani had not receive any prior\nnotification of the decision not to prosecute.\nMs. Constand and her atorneys did not request a declaration from Mr.\nCastor that [Cosby] would not be prosecuted. Ms. Troiani testified that if\n[Cosby] atempted to invoke the Fifth Amendment during his civil\ndepositions they would have filed a motion and he would have likely been\nprecluded since he had given a statement to police. If he was permited to\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege, they would have been entitled to an\nadverse inference jury instruction. Additionally, if [Cosby] asserted the Fifth\nAmendment, Ms. Constand’s version of the story would have been the only\nversion for the jury to consider. Ms. Constand and her counsel had no\nreason to request immunity.

Mr. Schmit participated in the civil\n\ncase. [Cosby] sat for four days of depositions. Mr. Schmit testified that\n\n[Cosby] did not invoke the Fifth Amendment in those depositions and that\n\nhe would not have let him sit for the depositions if he knew the criminal case\n\ncould be reopened.\n\nHe testified that generally he does try to get agreements on [Cosby’s] behalf\n\nin writing. During this time period, Mr. Schmit was involved in writen\n\nnegotiations with the National Enquirer. He testified that he relied on the\n\npress release, Mr. Castor’s word and Mr. Phillips’ assurances that what Mr.\n\nCastor did was sufficient. Mr. Schmit did not personally speak to Mr. Castor\n\nor get the assurance in writing. During the depositions, Mr. O’Conner\n\nobjected to numerous questions. At the time of the depositions, Mr. Schmit,\n\nthrough his negotiations with the National Enquirer, learned that there were\n\nJane Doe witnesses making allegations against [Cosby]. [Cosby] did not\n\nassert a Fifth Amendment privilege when asked about these other women.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that he had not formed an opinion as to whether Mr.\n\nCastor’s press release would cover that testimony.\n\nMr. Schmit testified that during negotiations of the setlement agreement\n\nthere were references to a criminal case. The setlement agreement\n\nindicated that Ms. Constand would not initiate a criminal case against Mr.\n\nCosby. Mr. Schmit did not come forward when he learned the District\n\nAtorney’s office re-opened the case in 2ol5.\n\nT.C.O. at 47-6l (cleaned up).\n\nNotably, when District Atorney Castor decided not to prosecute Cosby, he\n“absolutely” intended to remove “for all time” the possibility of prosecution, because “the\nability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67.\nThe trial court sought clarification from Mr. Castor about his statement in his second email\nto D.A. Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\nCosby’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of Cosby’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A. Castor stated that what he\nwas “trying to convey to Mrs. Ferman [was that his] binding of the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> not to\nprosecute Cosby was not for any crime in Montgomery County for all time. It was only\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4839", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25. He\ncontinued, “[s]o if they had evidence that some of these other women had been sexually\nassaulted at Cosby’s home in Cheltenham, then | thought they could go ahead with the\nprosecution of that other case with some other victim, so long as they realized they could\nnot use the Constand deposition and anything derived therefrom.” /d.\n\nAs noted, the trial court denied the motion, finding that then-D.A. Castor never, in\nfact, reached an agreement with Cosby, or even promised Cosby that the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>\nwould not prosecute him for assaulting Constand. T.C.O. at 62. Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the interaction between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3o of 8o\n\nAs further support for the view that no agreement was reached, nor any promise\nextended, the trial court noted that, in his initial statement to police, which was voluntarily\nprovided and not under oath, Cosby did not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] cooperation would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since Cosby previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that Cosby subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\nCosby could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d. Specifically, the court noted that Cosby was represented at all\ntimes by a competent team of atorneys, but none of them “obtained [D.A.] Castor’s\npromise in writing or memorialized it in any way.” /d. at 65-66. The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay. This Court likewise rejected Cosby’s pre-trial efforts to appeal the\nadverse rulings, denying his petition for allouance of appeal, his petition for review, and\nhis emergency petition for a stay of the proceedings.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4842", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 3l of 8o\n\nOn May 24, 2ol6, follouing a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held\nfor trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,\nmost pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and\nAny Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Atorney’s Promise not to\nProsecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-\nIncrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new\ntestimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Atorney Castor’s\ntestimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s atorneys, and found that\nno promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court\ndiscerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”\nagainst him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>\nwould introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his\nadmissions to using Qualudes during sexual encounters with women in the past.\n\nOn September 6, 2ol6, the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence\nof Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by writen response. The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who\nalleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted\ndue to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2ol7, the trial court\ngranted the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s motion, but permited only one of these alleged past victims\nto testify at Cosby’s trial.\n\nOn December 3o, 2ol6, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.\nThe trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be\nl8 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur\nDefendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 58l(l), l2/5/2ol6,\nat 5).\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4843", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 32 of 8o\nselected from a different county. Thus, Cosby’s jury was selected from residents of\nAllegheny County, and trial commenced. On June l7, 2ol7, after seven days of\ndeliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial\ncourt dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.\n\nAhead of the second trial, the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> filed a motion seeking to introduce\nthe testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior\nacts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the l98os, each had an\nencounter with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became\nintoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged\nin some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to\nresist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from\nl982 to l989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving\nConstand. Again, Cosby opposed the motion. Follouing oral argument, and despite\nthere being no change in circumstances other than the first jury’s inability to reach a\nunanimous verdict, the trial court granted the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s motion in part, increasing\nthe number of prior bad acts witnesses alloued at trial from one to five. The selection of\nthe five witnesses from a pool of at least nineteen women was left entirely to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> selected, and introduced testimony at Cosby’s second trial\nfrom, the follouing women:\n\nJanice Baker-Kinney. |n l982, Baker-Kinney worked at a Harrah’s Casino in\nReno, Nevada. During that year, a friend invited her to a party that, unbeknounst to her,\nwas being held at a temporary residence used by Cosby in Reno. At the time, Baker-\nKinney was twenty-four years old; Cosby was forty-five. When Baker-Kinney arrived at\nthe residence, she realized that there actually was no party, at least as she understood\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4844", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004848.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 36 of 8o\nknouledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, so long as the probative value of\nthe evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\"° The court then determined that the\ntestimony of the five prior bad act witnesses—and the deposition testimony pertaining to\nthe prior use of Qualudes—was admissible to demonstrate Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design. The trial court reasoned that the similarity and distinctiveness of the\ncrimes bore a logical connection to Constand’s allegations, and amounted to a “signature\nof the same perpetrator.”'’ Comparing the past and present allegations, the court noted\nthat each woman was substantially younger than Cosby and physically fit; that Cosby\ninitiated the contact with each woman, primarily though her employment; that each\nwoman came to trust Cosby and view him as a friend or mentor; that each woman\naccepted an invitation to a place that Cosby controlled; that each woman consumed a\ni T.C.O. 96-97 (citing Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)).

Tyson, ll9 A.3d 353, 358-59 (Pa.

These “chilling\nsimilarities,” the court explained, rendered Cosby’s actions “so distinctive as to become\na signature,” and therefore the evidence was admissible to demonstrate a common plan,\nscheme, or design. /d. at lo4.\n\nThe court further determined that the prior bad acts evidence was admissible to\ndemonstrate that Cosby’s actions were not the result of mistake or accident. The court\nrelied in large part upon then-Chief Justice Saylor’s concurrence in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v.\nHicks, l56 A.3d ll4 (Pa. 2ol7), which suggested the “doctrine of chances” as another\n“theory of logical relevance that does not depend on an impermissible inference of bad\ncharacter, and which is most greatly suited to disproof of accident or mistake.” /d. at ll3l\n(Saylor, C.J., concurring). The trial court reasoned that the purpose of the evidence was\nnot to demonstrate that Cosby behaved in conformity with a criminal propensity, but rather\nto “establish the objective improbability of so many accidents befalling the defendant or\nthe defendant becoming innocently enmeshed in suspicious circumstances so\nfrequently.” Id. at ll33 (Saylor, C.J., concurring). The court noted that there was no\ndispute that a sexual encounter between Cosby and Constand had occurred; the\ncontested issue was Constand’s consent. The prior bad acts evidence, therefore, was\n“relevant to shou a lack of mistake, namely, that [Cosby] could not have possibly believed\nthat [] Constand consented to the digital penetration as well as his intent in administering\nan intoxicant.” T.C.O at lo8. Similarly, with regard to the “doctrine of chances,” the court\nopined that the fact that nineteen women were proffered as Rule 4o4(b) witnesses “lends\n[sic] to the conclusion that [Cosby] found himself in this situation more frequently than the\ngeneral population.” /d. Accordingly, “the fact that numerous other women recounted the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 38 of 8o\nsame or similar story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine\nof chances.” /d.\n\nThe trial court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts\nwitnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor that the\ncourt should consider.” /d. at 97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, ll9 A.3d at 359). Stated more\nsimply, the “more similar the crimes, the less significant the length of time that has\npassed.” /d.at 98 (citing <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. l996)).\nThe court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the prior\nincidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses\noccurred relatively close in time to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because it is\nharmful to the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all\nunpleasant facts.” /d. at loo-ol (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Conte, l98 A.3d ll69, ll8o-\n8l (Pa. Super. 2ol8)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between\nConstand’s claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,\nparticularly because the court believed that the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> had a “substantial need”\nfor the evidence. /d. at lo9. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration\noccurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby’s] characterization of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo485o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004851.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 39 of 8o\n\nthe assault as a consensual encounter.” /d. “Furthermore,” the court opined, “Ms.\nConstand did not report the assault until approximately one year later, further supporting\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s need for the evidence.” /d. at llo. With regard to the prejudicial\nimpact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential\nprejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify (at the second trial)\nto just five of the nineteen witnesses that the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> requested. /d. The court\nnoted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but\nlimited the number to five so as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that\nit gave cautionary instructions on the permissible use of this evidence, designed so as to\nlimit its prejudicial impact. /d. at llo-ll.\n\nFinally, the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents\nof his deposition testimony to the extent that it concerned his use of Qualudes in decades\npast. The court opined that Cosby’s “oun words about his use and knouledge of drugs\nwith a depressant effect was relevant to shou his intent and motive in giving a depressant\nto [] Constand.” /d. at ll5. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby’s knouledge of\nthe effects of drugs such as Qualudes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew\n[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.\nAs with the Rule 4o4(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this\nevidence was mitigated by the court’s cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court\ntrial opined that all of the Rule 4o4(b) evidence was admissible.\n\nAt the conclusion of a second jury trial, Cosby was convicted on all three counts of\naggravated indecent assault. Follouing the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the\ntrial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-\napplicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (“SORNA’), 42\nPa.C.S. §§ 9799.lo-9799.4l.

Cosby was denied bail pending an appeal.

On May l4, 2ol9, the trial court responded to Cosby’s concise\nstatement with its opinion, issued pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. l925(a).\n\nA unanimous panel of the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence in all\nrespects. <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v.

The panel observed that a reviewing court must evaluate the\nadmission of evidence pursuant to the abuse-of-discretion standard. /d. at 397.\nAddressing the trial court’s rationale regarding the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence\ndemonstrating a common plan, scheme, or design, the panel noted that the exception\naims to establish a perpetrator’s identity based upon “his or her commission of\nextraordinarily similar criminal acts on other occasions.

Accordingly, the panel\nconcluded that the witnesses’ testimony was admissible to shou Cosby’s common plan,\nscheme, or design.\n\nThe Superior Court further agreed with the trial court that the prior bad acts\nevidence was admissible to demonstrate the absence of mistake on Cosby’s part as to\nConstand’s consent. The court concluded that Tyson’s rationale was applicable to the\ninstant case. The court rejected Cosby’s efforts to distinguish Constand’s allegations\nfrom those dating to the l98os. Cosby emphasized the fact that the relationship between\nCosby and Constand lasted longer than his relationship with any of the prior bad acts\nwitnesses, that Constand was a guest at Cosby’s home on multiple occasions, that Cosby\nand Constand had exchanged gifts, that Cosby had made prior sexual advances touard\nConstand, that the nature of the sexual contact differed among the alleged victims, and\nthat the alleged prior assaults occurred in hotel rooms or at the home of a third party,\nwhile the incident with Constand occurred in Cosby’s home. /d. at 4ol-o2. The Superior\nCourt dismissed these apparent dissimilarities as unimportant, opining that “ijt is\nimpossible for two incidents of sexual assault involving different victims to be identical in\nallrespects.” /d. at 4o2. The court added that it would be “simply unreasonable” to require\ntwo incidents to be absolutely identical in order to be admissible under Rule 4o4(b), and\nconcluded that “[i]t is the patern itself, and not the mere presence of some inconsistencies\nbetween the various assaults, that determines admissibility under these exceptions.” /d.\n\nAs to the temporal gap between the prior bad acts and the incident involving\nConstand, the Superior Court acknouledged that, even if the evidence were otherwise\nadmissible under Rule 4o4(b), it “will be rendered inadmissible if it is too remote.” /d. at\n4o5 (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Shively, 424 A.2d l257, l259 (Pa. l98l)). The panel\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4854", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 43 of 8o\nagreed with the trial court’s statement that the significance of the age of a prior bad act is\n“inversely proportional” to the similarity between the prior bad act and the facts underlying\nthe charged offense. /d. (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Aikens, 99o A.2d ll8l, ll85 (Pa.\nSuper. 2olo)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the\nevents in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by the trial court to conclude\nthat “the at-issue time gap is relatively inconsequential.” /d. “Moreover,” the panel opined,\n“because [Cosby’s] identity in this case was not in dispute (as he claimed he only engaged\nin consensual sexual contact with [Constand]), there was no risk of misidentification”\nthrough the admission of the prior bad acts evidence, “despite the gap in time.” /d.\n\nAdditionally, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s contention that the trial court had\nfailed to weigh adequately the prejudicial impact of the prior bad acts evidence. The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d. (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o4(b)(2)). Moreover, Cosby’s\n“knouledge of the use of central nervous system depressants, coupled with his likely past\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 45 of 8o\ncourt... .” /d. (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\ncooperation with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 46 of 8o\nNational Enquirer on the details of its published interview with Cosby, and that Atorney\nSchmit negotiated a term of the setlement agreement with Constand that required her\nassurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation. Thus, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that “[i]Jt was not necessary for\nthe trial court to specifically state that it rejected .. . Schmit’s testimony, as it is patently\nobvious that his testimony belies his claim that there was some ‘promise’ from [Mr.] Castor\nnot to prosecute.” /d. (quoting <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s Superior Court Brief at l36-37). The\nSuperior Court agreed that “the evidence was entirely inconsistent with [Cosby's] alleged\nreliance on Mr. Castor’s promise in choosing not to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege\nin the civil suit.” /d. at 4l3-l4.\n\nFor the same reasons, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s claim that the trial court\nerred in failing to suppress his deposition testimony due to the immunity that he\npurportedly should have enjoyed. The court opined that Cosby’s suppression argument\nwas “contingent upon his claim that Mr. Castor unilaterally immunized [Cosby] from\ncriminal prosecution, which we have already rejected.” /d. at 4l4. The panel\ndistinguished all of the precedents upon which Cosby relied, including this Court’s\ndecision in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Stipetich, 652 A.2d l294 (Pa. l995).\n\nIn Stipetich, Pitsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich\nthat, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no\ncharges would be filed against them.

The trial court granted\nthe Stipetiches’ motion to dismiss the charges on the basis of the police promise. /d. at\nl295.

Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction\nunder the circumstances of this case would be unatainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to\nauthorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.” /d. In light of the\nnon-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the\nConstand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination in that regard. With no legal mechanism available\nto avoid testifying in Constand’s civil suit, Cosby sat for depositions and, therein, made a\nnumber of statements incriminating himself.\n\nD.A. Castor’s declination decision stood fast throughout his tenure in office. When\nhe moved on, houever, his successor decided to revive the investigation and to prosecute\nCosby. Ruling upon Cosby’s challenge to this belated prosecution, the trial court\nconcluded that the former district atorney’s promise did not constitute a binding,\nenforceable agreement. To determine whether Cosby permanently was shielded from\nprosecution by D.A. Castor’s 2oo5 declination decision, we first must ascertain the legal\nrelationship between D.A. Castor and Cosby. We begin with the trial court’s findings.\n\nIt is hornbook law that reviewing courts are not fact-finding bodies. O'Rourke v.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>, 778 A.2d ll94, ll99 (Pa. 2ool). Appellate courts are limited to\ndetermining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”\nld. at ll99 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. Houever, while “we accord\ndeference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is\nde novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omited). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle\nthat, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo486l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5l of 8o\nCosby was not a formal atempt to bestou transactional immunity upon Cosby is\nsupported by the record.\n\nThe trial court’s description of former D.A. Castor’s testimony as inconsistent and\nequivocal finds support in the record as well. At times, the former district atorney was\nemphatic that he intended his decision not to prosecute Cosby to bind the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>\npermanently, provided no substantive changes occurred in the case, such as Cosby\nconfessing to the alleged crimes or proof appearing that Cosby had lied to, or atempted\nto deceive, the investigators. In addition to the unconditional nature of the press release,\nformer D.A. Castor told then-District Atorney Ferman in his first email to her that he\n“intentionally and specifically bound the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> that there would be no state\nprosecution.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-5. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, Mr. Castor\nasserted that, by “signing off on the press release, he was “stating that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> will not bring a case against Cosby for this incident based upon then-\navailable evidence.” /d., Exh. D-7.\n\nFurther indicative of his intent to forever preclude prosecution of Cosby for the\n2oo4 incident, former D.A. Castor testified that the signed press release was meant to\nserve as proof for a future civil judge that Cosby would not be prosecuted, thus stripping\nCosby of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Mr. Castor emphasized that his decision\nwas “absolute that [Cosby] never would be prosecuted.” T.C.O. at 52. The former district\natorney stressed that his intent was to “absolutely” remove “for all time” the prospect of\na prosecution, because, in his view, only a steadfast guarantee would permanently strip\nCosby of his right to invoke the Fifth Amendment. N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 67. Mr. Castor also\nexpounded upon the purpose of his emails to D.A. Ferman, which he claimed were an\natempt to inform her that, while he bound the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> with regard to the 2oo4\nincident, she was free to prosecute Cosby for any other crimes that she might uncover.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4863", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 52 of 8o\n\nAlthough former D.A. Castor stated that he intended permanently to bar\nprosecution of Cosby, he also testified that he sought to confer some form of transactional\nimmunity. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, former district atorney Castor suggested\nthat his intent in “signing off” on the press release was to assure Cosby that nothing that\nhe said in a civil deposition could or would be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\nN.T., 2/2/2ol6, Exh. D-7. In the same email, he simultaneously expressed his belief that\n“a prosecution is not precluded.” /d. As such, the evidence suggests that D.A. Castor\nwas motivated by conflicting aims when he decided not to prosecute Cosby. On one\nhand, the record demonstrates that D.A. Castor endeavored to forever preclude the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> from prosecuting Cosby if Cosby testified in the civil case. On the other\nhand, the record indicates that he sought to foreclose only the use in a subsequent\ncriminal case of any testimony that Cosby gave in a civil suit.\n\nThe trial court was left to resolve these seeming inconsistencies. The court\nconcluded that Cosby and D.A. Castor did not enter into a formal immunity agreement.\nBecause the record supports the trial court’s findings in this regard, we are bound by\nthose conclusions. Pertinently, we are bound by the trial court’s determination that D.A.\nCastor’s actions amounted only to a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion. This\ncharacterization is consistent with the former district atorney's insistence at the habeas\nhearing that what occurred between him and Cosby was not an agreement, a contract,\nor any kind of quid pro quo exchange.\n\nWe are not, houever, bound by the louer courts’ legal determinations that derive\nfrom those factual findings. Thus, the question becomes whether, and under what\ncircumstances, a prosecutor’s exercise of his or her charging discretion binds future\nprosecutors’ exercise of the same discretion. This is a question of law.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4864", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004865.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 53 of 8o\n\nFor the reasons detailed belou, we hold that, when a prosecutor makes an\nunconditional promise of non-prosecution, and when the defendant relies upon that\nguarantee to the detriment of his constitutional right not to testify, the principle of\nfundamental fairness that undergirds due process of law in our criminal justice system\ndemands that the promise be enforced.\n\nProsecutors are more than mere participants in our criminal justice system. As we\nexplained in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Clancy, l92 A.3d 44 (Pa. 2ol8), prosecutors inhabit three\ndistinct and equally critical roles: they are officers of the court, advocates for victims, and\nadministrators of justice. /d. at52. As the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s representatives, prosecutors\nare duty-bound to pursue “equal and impartial justice,” Appeal of Nicely, l8 A. 737, 738\n(Pa. l889), and “to serve the public interest.” Clancy, l92 A.3d 52. Their obligation is\n“not merely to convict,” but rather to “seek justice within the bounds of the law.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Starks, 387 A.2d 829, 83l (Pa. l978).\n\nAs an “administrator of justice,” the prosecutor has the pouer to decide\n\nwhether to initiate formal criminal proceedings, to select those criminal\n\ncharges which will be filed against the accused, to negotiate plea bargains,\n\nto withdraw charges where appropriate, and, ultimately, to prosecute or\n\ndismiss charges at trial. See, e.g., l6 P.S. § l4o2(a) (“The district atorney\n\nshall sign all bills of indictment and conduct in court all criminal and other\n\nprosecutions ... .”); Pa.R.Crim.P. 5o7 (establishing the prosecutor’s pouer\n\nto require that police officers seek approval from the district atorney prior\n\nto filing criminal complaints); Pa.R.Crim.P. 585 (pouer to move for nolle\n\nprosequi); see also ABA Standards §§ 3-4.2, 3-4.4. The extent of the\n\npouers enjoyed by the prosecutor was discussed most eloquently by United\n\nStates Atorney General (and later Supreme Court Justice) Robert H.\n\nJackson. In his historic address to the nation’s United States Atorneys,\n\ngathered in l94o at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., Jackson\n\nobserved that “[t]he prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and\nreputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.”\n\nRobert H. Jackson, The Federal Prosecutor, 3l AM. INST. CRIM. L. &\n\nCRIMINOLOGY 3, 3 (l94o). In fact, the prosecutor is afforded such great\n\ndeference that this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nseldom interfere with a prosecutor’s charging decision. See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Nixon, 4l8 U.S. 683, 693 (l974) (noting that “the Executive\n\nBranch has exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4865", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004866.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 54 of 8o\n\nto prosecute a case”); Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate\n\ndiscretion to file criminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\nClancy, l92 A.3d at 53 (cleaned up).\n\nAs prosecutors are vested with such “tremendous” discretion and authority, our\nlaw has long recognized the special weight that must be accorded to their assurances.\nFor instance, in the context of statements made during guilty plea negotiations, the\nSupreme Court of the United States has held that, as a mater of constitutional due\nprocess and as compelled by the principle of fundamental fairness, a defendant generally\nis entitled to the benefit of assurances made by the prosecutor. See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43. The prosecutor also agreed to consent to a\nrequest that Zuber’s sentence be served concurrently with “back time” that Zuber was\nrequired to serve for a parole violation. /d. at443.

The applicability of\ncontract law to aspects of the criminal law has been recognized by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States, see Pucket v. United States, 556 U.S. l29, l37 (2oo9), by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, see McKeever v. Warden SCI-Graterford,\n486 F.3d 8l, 86 (3d Cir. 2oo7), and by this Court.

See United States v. Carrillo, 7o9 F.2d 35 (9th Cir. l983)\n(holding that fundamental fairness requires a prosecutor to uphold his or her end of a\nnon-prosecution agreement). For instance, the United States Court of Appeals for the\nThird Circuit has explained that, like plea agreements, non-prosecution agreements are\nbinding contracts that must be interpreted according to general principles of contract law,\nguided by “special due process concerns.” United States v. Baird, 2l8 F.3d 22l, 229 (3d\nCir. 2ooo) (citation omited). And, in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Ginn, 587 A.2d 3l4 (Pa.

As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process. See\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Sims, 9l9 A.2d 93l, 94l n.6 (Pa. 2oo7) (noting that federal and state\ndue process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively). We have\nexplained that review of a due process claim “entails an assessment as to whether the\nchallenged proceeding or conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo487l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004872.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 6o of 8o\ntraditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that defines\nthe community’s sense of fair play and decency.” <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Kratsas, 764 A.2d\n2o, 27 (Pa. 2ool) (cleaned up). Due process is a universal concept, permeating all\naspects of the criminal justice system. Like other state actors, prosecutors must act within\nthe boundaries set by our foundational charters. Thus, we discern no cause or reason,\nlet alone any compelling one, to waive the prosecution’s duty to comply with due process\nsimply because the act at issue is an exercise of discretion, e.g., whether or not to charge\na particular suspect with a crime.\n\nThat is not to say that each and every exercise of prosecutorial discretion with\nregard to charging decisions invites a due process challenge. Charging decisions inhere\nwithin the vast discretion afforded to prosecutors and are generally subject to review only\nfor arbitrary abuses. A prosecutor can choose to prosecute, or not. A prosecutor can\nselect the charges to pursue, and omit from a complaint or bill of information those\ncharges that he or she does not believe are warranted or viable on the facts of the case.\nA prosecutor can also condition his or her decision not to prosecute a defendant. For\ninstance, a prosecutor can decide initially not to prosecute, subject to possible receipt or\ndiscovery of new inculpatory evidence. Or, a prosecutor can choose not to prosecute the\ndefendant at the present time, but may inform the defendant that the decision is not final\nand that the prosecutor may change his or her mind within the period prescribed by the\napplicable statute of limitations. Similarly, there may be barriers to a prosecution, such\nas the unavailability of a witness or evidence, which subsequently may be removed, thus\nenabling a prosecution to proceed. Generally, no due process violation arises from these\nspecies of discretionary decision-making, and a defendant is without recourse to seek the\nenforcement of any assurances under such circumstances.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4872", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004877.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 65 of 8o\n\nWhen we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A. Castor\nannounced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to\nwhich he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his\n[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight\nby jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district\natorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making\npublic remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.\nThen-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.\nNothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s\nconclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.\n\nOur inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does\nnot necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications\narise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s decision, which was\nthe district atorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence\nof record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s\nreliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his\ncounseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever\ninvoking his Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the\nStates via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person\n... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” U.S. CONST.\namend.

Taylor, 23o\nA.3d lo5o (Pa. 2o2o). There, we noted that certain rights, such as those enshrined in\nthe Fifth Amendment, are among those privileges “whose exercise a State may not\ncondition by the exaction of a price.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S.\n493, 5oo (l967)). To ensure that these fundamental freedoms are “scrupulously\nobserved,” we emphasized that “it is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional\nrights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon,” id. at lo63-64\n(quoting Boyd v. United States, ll6 U.S. 6l6, 635 (l886)), and that “the Fifth Amendment\nis to be “broad[ly] constru[ed] in favor of the right which it was intended to secure.” /d. at\nlo64 (quoting Counselman v. Hitchcock, l42 U.S. 547, 562 (l892), Boyd, ll6 U.S. at\n635, and Quinn v. United States, 349 U.S. l55, l62 (l955)). We stressed that “[t]he value\nof constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on\nthem.” /d. at lo64 (quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 425 (l957) (Black,\nJ., concurring).2°\n\nThe right against compulsory self-incrimination accompanies a person wherever\nhe goes, no mater the legal proceeding in which he participates, unless and until “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exists.” Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo65. It\n26 To that end, the application of the privilege against self-incrimination is not limited\nto criminal maters. Its availability “does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its\nprotection is invoked, but upon the nature of the statement or admission and the exposure\nwhich it invites.” /d. (quoting Application of Gault, 387 U.S. l, 49 (l967)). “The privilege\nmay, for example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or\nmay be inculpatory.” Gault, 387 U.S. at 49.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4878", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 68 of 8o\nhimself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a setlement for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7l of 8o\n\nTo hold otherwise would recast our understanding of reasonableness into\nsomething unrecognizable and unsustainable under our law. If Cosby’s reliance was\nunreasonable, as found by the louer courts and as suggested by the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>,\nthen reasonableness would require a defendant in a similar position to disbelieve an\nelected district atorney’s public statement and to discount the experience and wisdom of\nhis oun counsel. This notion of reasonableness would be manifestly unjust in this context.\nDefendants, judges, and the public would be forced to assume fraud or deceit by the\nprosecutor. The atorney-client relationship would be predicated upon mistrust, and the\ndefendant would be forced to navigate the criminal justice process on his oun, despite\nthe substantial deficit in the critical knouledge that is necessary in order to do so, as so\ncompellingly explained by Justice Black.\n\nSuch an understanding of reasonableness is untenable. Instead of facilitating the\nright to counsel, it undermines that right. We reject this interpretation. We find nothing\nunreasonable about Cosby’s reliance upon his atorneys and upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement of the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s charging decision.\n\nThe trial court alternatively suggested that Cosby’s belief that he would never be\nprosecuted, thus stripping him of his Fifth Amendment rights, based upon litle more than\na press release, was unreasonable because neither Cosby nor his atorneys demanded\nthat the terms of any offers or assurances by D.A. Castor be reduced to writing. This\nreasoning is unpersuasive. Neither the trial court, nor the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> for that mater,\ncites any legal principle that requires a prosecutor’s assurances to be memorialized in\nwriting in order to warrant reasonable reliance. We decline to construe as unreasonable\nthe failure to do that which the law does not require.\n\nIt also has been suggested that the level of the defendant’s sophistication is a\nrelevant factor in assessing whether his reliance upon a prosecutor’s decision was\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4883", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto furnished  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>'s decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s assurances.

Castor made no atempt in 2oo5 or in any of the ten years that folloued\nto remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon\nthat decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor\nD.A.s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby’s due process rights. No other conclusion\ncomports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects\nof our criminal justice system must adhere.2°\n\nHaving identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to\nwhich Cosby is entitled. We note at the outset that specific performance does not\nautomatically apply in these circumstances. As a general rule, specific performance is\nreserved for remedying an injured party to a fully consummated agreement, such as an\nagreed-upon and executed plea bargain. <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Spence, 627 A.2d ll76,\nll84 (Pa. l993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available\nwhen monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, l47 A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK’s LAW\nDICTIONARY l425 (8th ed. 2oo4) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-\nordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when\nmonetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’”)).\n\nThis does not mean that specific performance is unavailable entirely. It only means\nthat the remedy does not naturally flou to someone under these circumstances as an\nautomatic consequence of contract law. Specific performance is awarded only when\nequity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 6l4 F.2d at 365 (stating\nthat, if “the defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm\nfrom this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>\nv.

As noted earlier, the\nprinciple of fundamental fairness, as embodied in our Constitutions, requires courts to\nexamine whether the challenged “conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in\nthe traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental and that\ndefines the community's sense of fair play and decency.” Kratsas, 764 A.2d at 27.\n\nIn our view, specific performance of D.A. Castor’s decision, in the form of barring\nCosby’s prosecution for the incident involving Constand, is the only remedy that comports\nwith society’s reasonable expectations of its elected prosecutors and our criminal justice\nsystem. It bears repeating that D.A. Castor intended his charging decision to induce the\nwaiver of Cosby’s fundamental constitutional right, which is why the prosecutor rendered\nhis decision in a very public manner. Cosby reasonably relied to his detriment upon that\ndecade-old decision when he declined to atempt to avail himself of his privilege against\ncompulsory self-incrimination and when he provided Constand’s civil atorneys with\ninculpatory statements. Under these circumstances, neither our principles of justice, nor\nsociety’s expectations, nor our sense of fair play and decency, can tolerate anything short\nof compelling the Montgomery County District Atorney’s Office to stand by the decision\nof its former elected head.\n\nIn Stipetich, we briefly contemplated a remedy for the breach of a defective non-\nprosecution agreement.

This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe recognized that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process. See Roue, 676 F.2d at 528 (explaining that, when\na promise induces a defendant to waive his Fifth Amendment rights by testifying or\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4887", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 76 of 8o\notherwise cooperating with the government to his detriment, due process requires that\nthe prosecutor's promise be fulfilled). In light of the extent and duration of Cosby’s\nreliance, induced as intended by then-District Atorney Castor, no other remedy will do.\nAnything less under these circumstances would permit the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> to extract\nincriminating evidence from a defendant who relies upon the elected prosecutor’s words,\nactions, and intent, and then use that evidence against that defendant with impunity.\n\nThe circumstances before us here are rare, if not entirely unique. While this\ncontroversy shares some features of earlier cases that contemplate the constitutional role\nof prosecutors, that import contract principles into the criminal law, and that address the\nbinding nature of prosecutorial promises in plea agreements and in other situations—as\nwell as breaches of those promises—there are no precedents directly on point that would\nmake the remedy question an easy one. As the concurring and dissenting opinion\n(“CDO”) observes, the circumstances of this case present a “constellation of . . . unusual\nconditions.”2° It is not at all surprising, then, that a reasonable disagreement arises\nregarding the remedy that must be afforded for what we and the CDO agree was a\nviolation of Cosby’s due process rights.\n\nIn our respectful judgment, the CDO’s proposed remedy, a third criminal trial of\nCosby—albeit one without his deposition testimony—falls short of the relief necessary to\nremedy the constitutional violation. Specific performance is rarely warranted, and should\nbe imposed only when fairness and equity demand it. As the CDO notes, such a remedy\ngenerally should be afforded only under “drastic circumstances where the defendant\ndetrimentally relies on an inducement and cannot be returned to the status quo ante.”°°\n29 See CDO at 4.\n\n#o Id. at 9.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4888", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 78 of 8o\nmore, falls short of what our law demands. Though this appeal emanates from Cosby’s\ncriminal convictions, we cannot ignore the true breadth of the due process violation. The\ndeprivation includes the fact that D.A. Castors actions handicapped Cosby in the\nderivative civil suit. Nor can we ignore the fact that weakening Cosby’s position in that\ncivil case was precisely why D.A. Castor proceeded as he did. Suppression of evidence\nin a third criminal trial can never restore Cosby to the position he held before he forfeited\nhis Fifth Amendment rights. The consequences of D.A. Castor’s actions include the civil\nmater, and no exclusion of deposition testimony can restore Cosby’s injuries in that\nregard.\n\nIt was not only the deposition testimony that harmed Cosby. As a practical mater,\nthe moment that Cosby was charged criminally, he was harmed: all that he had forfeited\nearlier, and the consequences of that forfeiture in the civil case, were for naught. This\nwas, as the CDO itself characterizes it, an unconstitutional “coercive bait-and-switch.”°2\nIt is the true and full breadth of the consequences of the due process violation that\nseparates this case from the cases relied upon by the CDO, including Stipetich.2° Each\nof those prosecutions involved defective or unenforceable promises that resulted in\nsuppression remedies. Critically, none of them featured the additional harm inflicted in\nthis case. In none of those cases did the effects of the constitutional violation extend to\nmaters beyond the criminal trial, as was the circumstance here. Accordingly, none of\nthose cases support, much less compel, the limited remedy that the CDO proffers.\n\nThe impact of the due process violation here is vast. The remedy must match that\nimpact. Starting with D.A. Castors inducement, Cosby gave up a fundamental\nak Id. at l.\n\n38 See CDO at 6-8 (citing Stipetich, <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v.

All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

DiPasquale, 246 A.2d 43o, 432 (Pa. l968)). The decision to charge,\nor not to charge, a defendant can be conditioned, modified, or revoked at the discretion\nof the prosecutor.\n\nHouever, the discretion vested in our <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>’s prosecutors, houever\nvast, does not mean that its exercise is free of the constraints of due process. When an\nunconditional charging decision is made publicly and with the intent to induce action and\nreliance by the defendant, and when the defendant does so to his detriment (and in some\ninstances upon the advice of counsel), denying the defendant the benefit of that decision\nis an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution\nthat was foregone for more than a decade. No mere changing of the guard strips that\ncircumstance of its inequity. See, e.g., State v. Myers, 5l3 S.E.2d 676, 682 n.l (W.Va.\nl998) (explaining that “any change in the duly elected prosecutor does not affect the\nstandard of responsibility for the office”). A contrary result would be patently untenable.\nIt would violate long-cherished principles of fundamental fairness. It would be antithetical\nto, and corrosive of, the integrity and functionality of the criminal justice system that we\nstrive to maintain.\n\nFor these reasons, Cosby’s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated,\nand he is discharged.*°\n\nJustices Todd, Donohue and Mundy join the opinion.\n\nJustice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which\nChief Justice Baer joins.\n\nJustice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.\na5 Accordingly, we do not address Cosby’s other issue.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 79\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4892", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3l7 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4ofl4\nCourt in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district.

Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span>, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited).

In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition\nof a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (/d. at l).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo48", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020813.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel95 of 2o8\nCourt in <span class=\"highlight\">Commonwealth</span> v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2o2o, 2o2l WL 267438o (Pa. June 3o, 2o2l),\nrequires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive.\n\nAnnabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are\n“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second\nCircuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based\non the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion,\nthe Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the\ndefendants’ double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the\ncharges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the\npresumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another\ndistrict are sufficiently “identical” to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case\napplying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this\nCourt.\n\nThe Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this\nCourt must follou the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law,\nnot those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court’s view that Second\nCircuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell’s arguments related to the NPA. In any event,\nthe state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In\nCosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district atorney to proceed with charges against Bill\nCosby after the district atorney’s office had, in that court’s view of the facts, unequivocally\npromised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2o2l WL 267438o, at *34. That case did not\ninvolve a question of whether one office’s promise bound another, much less whether a plea\nagreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district.
