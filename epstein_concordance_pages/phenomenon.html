Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3.

But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J.

Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously cross-examine [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”).

(Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B.

This will be folloued by a detailed account of the existing knouledge within the\nliterature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition\nof sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the\nsexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming ls required to facilitate\na preventative approach to child protection.\nKeywords Sexual grooming; theory of child sexual abuse\nIntroduction\nThe complex nature of the tactics used by child sex offenders in their efforts to sexually abuse\nchildren is increasingly evident in the accounts of the people affected by this predatory\nbehaviour. Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005936.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 45\nChild Abuse Review Vol. 24: l59-l69 (2ol5)\nPublished online 9 May 2ol5 in Wiley Online Library\n(wileyonlinelibrary.com) DOI: lo.loo2/car.228o\nPy Py ee\nDisclosure of Child Rosaleen McElvaney\nSchool of Nursing and Human\na Sciences, Dublin City University,\nSexual Abuse: Delays, Sc ed\nee\na\nNon-disclosure and\na a\nPartial Disclosure.

First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J.

Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability.

For the reasons already provided, the\nCourt finds that fit is satisfied here.\n\nThird, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is not substantially outweighed by\n4o3 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would not unduly\n““simplify’ an otherwise complex case” or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt.\nNo. 386 at ll.

The Defense calls this “grooming-by-proxy.” F.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology\naside, the Court agrees with this narrouer objection to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. As discussed at\nthe hearing, this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> is not identified in the relevant literature regarding child sexual\nabuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to\nbe an extrapolation of the broader principle of hou grooming functions through the development\nof trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follou common sense, but it is for the jury to\nmake on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that the\npresence of a third party can facilitate grooming.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3. Expert testimony about general principles is\nhelpful only when it “describe[es] widely recognized and highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena.” Raymond, 7oo F. Supp. 2d at l5o n.l2; Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3. But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6687", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J.

Accordingly, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will\nhelp the jury understand and contextualize the other testimony it will hear.‘\n\nThe defendant expresses concern that a lay jury will be unable to apply Dr. Rocchio’s\nanalyses to the facts of this case, stating “[t]hat is not hou Rule 7o2 works.” (Def.

Dr. Rocchio, houever, is not testifying about\ncommon experience or from common experience. Her testimony stems from her clinical\nexperience, and it concerns the psychological experiences of victims when a third person is present\nduring parts of their sexual abuse, as part of her broader opinion on atachment and coercion. The\naverage juror will not have knouledge of or experience in the psychology of abuse victims, and\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony will aid their understanding.\n\nThe defendant relatedly seeks to preclude Dr. Rocchio from testifying about “grooming-\nby-proxy,” a term which appears nouhere in the Government’s expert notice. (Def. Mot. 3 at 9).\nBy that term, the defendant appears to argue that Dr. Rocchio will opine that an individual can\ngroom a victim for abuse by another perpetrator, and that such an opinion is unreliable and\n“prejudicial speculation.” (/d.). This argument misses the mark in three respects. First, Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony primarily concerns the experience of victims, not perpetrators, as explained\nabove. If the victim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference\nwhether the perpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing\nthe victim for abuse by a third party. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 3l:l-34:l2, United States v. Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (explaining that, where there is a “reliable basis for\n.. . testi[mony] about trauma bonding and coercive control as phenomena that exist more broadly,”\nthe expert may testify, and defendants “are at liberty to vigorously cross-examine [the expert] to\natempt to cabin or limit trauma bonding and coercive control to populations predominately outside\nof the alleged victims in this case”). Indeed, expert testimony is commonly offered in sex\ntrafficking cases on the pimp-prostitute relationship, which is specifically designed to permit the\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6735", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the disclosure\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed disclosure is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay disclosure is a well-\nestablished <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news.

Issues\nof poor definition, the adoption of the term “grooming” and the prevalence of sexual grooming will be\ndiscussed. Consideration will be given to hou prominent theories of child sexual abuse often neglect\nsexual grooming. This will be folloued by a detailed account of the existing knouledge within the\nliterature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the\nenvironment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition\nof sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the\nsexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming ls required to facilitate\na preventative approach to child protection.\nKeywords Sexual grooming; theory of child sexual abuse\nIntroduction\nThe complex nature of the tactics used by child sex offenders in their efforts to sexually abuse\nchildren is increasingly evident in the accounts of the people affected by this predatory\nbehaviour. Sexual grooming is a pertinent issue evident in society, but there is still litle\nunderstanding about this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. This is reflected in problems relating to definition,\nwhich will be discussed in addition to the evolution of the term “grooming”. This review will\nconsider whether present aetiological theories of child sexual abuse can account for “sexual\ngrooming” behaviour, and further determines what knouledge has already been established\nabout the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of sexual grooming. Based on these findings, a new definition is\npresented and consideration is given to hou current knouledge of sexual grooming relate to\nmodels of the sexual offence process.\nDefinition\nProfessionals are yet to agree on a definition of sexual grooming of children (Gillespie, 2oo4).\nPrevious literature has provided three specific definitions of grooming.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid disclosure and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing disclosure, because in the event of\ndisclosure the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of disclosure affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 29l\n\nDespite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of\nsexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence\nprocess. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial\nonset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &\nDiClemente, l982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is\nchanged, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a\ntheory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As\ndemonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> they are atempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending\nit is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the\nsexual offending <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (l984) Pre-condition\nModel has taken this approach.\n\nOffence process\n\nIn addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, l984) there is one other model that\nconsiders the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the\nOffence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, l995). Ward et al.’s model provides a\nmuch more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While litle\nevidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a\ngrounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.\nThey identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s\nbackground factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning\nof the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two\ndescribes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or\nexplicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four\ninvolves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage\nfive entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a\nmutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is folloued by further\ncognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future\nresolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid\nfuture offending or to persist in an abusive patern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these\nresolutions on the offender’s life.\n\nIt is important to consider hou sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence\nprocess, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential\noffenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In\naddition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later\nstages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the\nprocess could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual\ninterest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to\noffend.\n\nThe grooming process\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—\n\nself-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.\n\nEach of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.\n\nUnderstanding of the grooming process and an ability to identify sexual grooming behaviour\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6827", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006861.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 45\nChild Abuse Review Vol. 24: l59-l69 (2ol5)\nPublished online 9 May 2ol5 in Wiley Online Library\n(wileyonlinelibrary.com) DOI: lo.loo2/car.228o\nPy Py ee\nDisclosure of Child Rosaleen McElvaney\nSchool of Nursing and Human\na Sciences, Dublin City University,\nSexual Abuse: Delays, Sc ed\nee\na\nNon-disclosure and\na a\nPartial Disclosure.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

So in addition to manipulating the\n\nl5 child, they'll manipulate individuals or institutions in that\nl6 child's life so that they're able to have greater access. So\nl7 they might, for example, befriend a child's parent and hold\n\nl8 themselves out as a trustworthy person who is going to help,\n\nl9 say, a single mom and he'll serve as a father figure to the\n2o kid. Or they might groom an institution, they might work their\n2l way up through the boy scouts, for example, and become a leader\n22 there, become a pillar in the community to give them an air of\n23 respectability, disarming, gaining trust.\n24 Q.

I also think it's important to recognize that\n\nlo this article was published many years ago. And there's\n\nll certainly been evolutions and additional literature since the\nl2 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I\n\nl3 think it's a litle misleading. If they're defining consensus\nl4 there as universal agreement as to exact -- everything within\nl5 the process of grooming, then sure. But when we're talking\n\nl6 about any patern of behavior or any <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> within the\n\nl7 social science, it's a complicated <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. You're never\n\nl8 going to get universal agreement among experts. That's why you\nl9 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a\n2o study.\n2l But most definitely, there's consensus within the\n22 scientific literature about the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> not only of\n23 grooming, but the <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> of child sexual abuse itself, what\n24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of\n25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7923", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007932.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 64 of l5963\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\n<span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span>. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

The testimony may be relevant to the jury’s\ndetermination of Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge because it could explain hou, for example, Ms.\nMaxwell took actions that resulted in sexual abuse but without any intent or knouledge of that\nresult. The risk of improper sympathy or the suggestion of nullification can be addressed with a\nlimiting instruction.\n\nThe Court will, houever, without a further shouing by the Defense, likely preclude Dr.\nDietz from applying the halo effect to Epstein. In the notice, Dr. Dietz diagnoses Epstein with\n“antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders” that “alloued him to use\nhis brilliance to manipulate people.” Notice at 6-7.

I don't -- I don't think that the study has serious flaws.\nl6 I think it has a lot of useful information.\n\nl7 As I said, there's no study I would agree with every\nl8 single part of. To the extent they're asking experts in the\n\nl9 field about groups of behavior strategies, techniques and modus\n2o operandi that have been well established and studied and\n2l they're asking a group of experts to what degree and what ways\n22 have they observed these well-studied phenomena in their\n23 respective fields, I think that's an appropriate question that\n24 can elicit useful information.\n25 Q.

Yes.\n\n3 Q. So that's yet another expert's opinion in this field about\n4 there being problems with this grooming moniker. Correct?\n\n5 A. No. TI wouldn't agree with that statement.\n\n6 Q. There are some other studies that you provided to the\n\n7 government that have not been introduced into evidence. And I\n8 Just want to ask you if you recall these. There is the study\n\n9 \"Sexual Grooming of Children: Review of Literature and\n\nlo Theoretical Considerations.\" Do you recall that?\n\nll A. The title is familiar. I don't recall the contents of that\nl2 specific article.\n\nl3 Q. Do you recall the conclusion being that there is still no\nl4 understanding about this phenomena when talking about grooming?\nl5 A. Are you talking about the Craven article?\n\nl6 QO. Yes.\n\nl7 A. My understanding is that was writen a long time ago. But,\nl8 no, I couldn't sit here and tell you that I have a recollection\nl9 of what specifically the conclusion of any of those specific\n2o articles were without having an opportunity to review them\n2l again.\n22 Q.

Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized <span class=\"highlight\">phenomenon</span> within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped.
