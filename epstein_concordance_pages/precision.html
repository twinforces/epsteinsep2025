Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with <span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 49\nconduct which was similar to the charged offenses such that the juror may have felt that she was\n“confronting the legality of [her] oun past acts as well.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48. While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\n<span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\n2. The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with <span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.!°\nl4 Tn particular, Juror 5o cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\nl5 For the reasons discussed above,\n\nSimilarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with <span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service.

While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with <span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4.

While the Second\nCircuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in inferring bias under the\ncircumstances presented there, it also made clear that the district would not have erred in declining\nto infer bias. Jd. Torres thus underscores the ample discretion which district judges have in\nstriking jurors for cause—discretion which this Court has properly exercised not to infer bias\nwhere jurors have disclosed being victims of sexual abuse or harassment.\n\nThe defendant has failed to establish inferred bias.\n\nI. The Court Should Schedule a Limited Hearing Regarding Juror 5o\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nA post-verdict hearing into alleged juror misconduct is proper only where there is “clear,\nstrong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety\nhas occurred.” United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93, l33 (2d Cir. 2oo9) (quoting /anniello, 866\nF.2d at 543). This standard can only be met by “concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct that\nconstitute competent and relevant evidence,” though such allegations “need not be irrebutable\nbecause if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing.” United States\nv. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8) (quoting Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543).\n\nIn the rare instances where an inquiry into potential juror misconduct is warranted, the\nscope of the hearing must be narrouly tailored. The Second Circuit has emphasized that the\ninquiry “should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with\n<span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “A hearing is not held to afford a convicted defendant the\nopportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” United States v. Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d l2lo,\nl234 (2d Cir. l983) (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. l978)). Instead,\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo983o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 35 of 49\ninterviewed by the Court; the parties were permited to propose questions before and during the\nhearing.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d l58 (2d Cir. 2oo2).\n\nThat course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject\nmater—the juror’s history of sexual abuse—presents a particularly high danger of harassment or\nembarrassment. Second, as noted above, the defendant’s brief is litered with information barred\nby Rule 6o6(b), suggesting a real danger she will seek to question Juror 5o about improper and\ninadmissible subjects. The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise the hearing by\nconducting the questioning itself.\n\nDn The Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited\n\nThe scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with <span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234; Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o.'4 Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are\nwhether Juror 5o intentionally lied in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 5o was actually\nbiased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.’\n\n‘4 Tn particular, Juror SO cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including\nhim) in the jury room, or what his mental process was as a deliberating juror. He also cannot be\nasked whether he or any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during\ndeliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b); Warger, 574 U.S. at 43-44 (“We hold that Rule 6o6(b) applies\nto juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground\nthat a juror lied during voir dire.”).\n\n'S For the reasons discussed above, the defendant has not met her burden with respect to Juror 5o’s\nvoir dire statements about his social media use and accordingly a hearing regarding such\nstatements is not warranted. Similarly, as discussed above, the defendant has also not met her\nburden with respect to whether Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror\n5o considers himself to be a victim of a crime. Houever, in the event that Juror 5o’s testimony at\nthe hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 5o answered Question 25 incorrectly as\nwell, the Government would consent to the Court questioning Juror 5o regarding that question.\nHouever, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with\nrespect to Question 48.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 43 of 49\n\nto become a “fishing expedition” but rather must limit the scope of any inquiry “to only what is\nabsolutely necessary to determine the facts with <span class=\"highlight\">precision</span>.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543-44. It is\nhard to imagine a request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom\ndeliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant’s request to compel production of a juror’s emails and\nother writen communications, as well as content from his Facebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram,\nand other social media accounts. (Def. Mem. at 48-49). Not surprisingly, the defendant cites no\nprecedent for this sweeping and invasive request. The Court should reject it.\n\nMoreover, each specific request is improper. Requests l(b) and l(c) call for\ncommunications between jurors and communications “about Juror No. 5o’s jury service,” and thus\ncall for information that, if it exists, is almost certainly inadmissible under Rule 6o6(b). Moreover,\nthe fact that Juror 5o made some public statements about his jury service does not give the\ndefendant license to compel the production of any statements he may have made to anyone—such\nas a friend or loved one—about his jury service. This is a classic fishing expedition and should\nnot be permited. Request l(a) calls for communications with victims and witnesses, but this too\nis a fishing expedition: Juror 5o’s public comment on a victim’s public Twiter post after trial does\nnot give the defense license to compel his private communications in the vague hope that, contrary\nto the Court’s instructions, he had some improper communications before or during trial.

In response to questioning by the Court, Juror 5o\nexplained, without hesitation, that he “did not hope to be on this jury” and that he “did not set out\nin order to get on this jury.”?

To the\ncontrary, that comment demonstrates Juror 5o’s candor at the hearing. Juror 5o said that ifhe had\nto serve jury duty, this case was “something interesting” when compared to more boring cases.\n(Id. at 44:8-ll; see id. at 44:6 (“So not everybody gets called for jury duty.”)).
