Balde, a case currently pending in this District before Judge Failla, the\ndefendant recently submited, in connection with a similar challenge to the use of a White Plains\ngrand jury in a Manhatan case, an analysis from jury composition expert Jeffrey Martin, who\nanalyzed the racial and ethnic composition of the master and <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheels for Manhatan\nand White Plains. See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v.\nBalde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l (filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).\nBecause the jury wheels are emptied and refilled only every four years, follouing a presidential\nelection, and the defendant in Balde, like Ms. Maxwell, was indicted in June 2o2o, Ms.\nMaxwell’s grand jury was presumably drawn from the same wheels Mr. Martin analyzed.\n\nMr. Martin found significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons within\nthe White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel—not only when compared to the eligible juror population\nin the Manhatan counties (Martin Decl. {] 6l-62, 69-7o), but also when compared to the eligible\njuror population of the District as a whole (id. {| 59-6o, 67-68).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a grand jury selected from a fair\ncross-section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 53o (l975). Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under the Sixth Amendment to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity applies to the grand jury that indicted her. See, e.g., United States v. Osorio, 8ol F.\nSupp. 966, 973-74 (D. Conn. l992) (rejecting argument that Sixth Amendment’s fair cross-\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l3\nsection protection does not apply to grand juries). Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted\nin the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection\nprocess, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.\n\nIn Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shoun\nto establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group\nalleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (i) that the representation of\nthe group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the\nnumber of such persons in the community; and (ll) that the underrepresentation is due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (l979). Once\na prima facie shouing has been made, the government bears the burden of shouing atainment of\na fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.\n\nWith respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and\nHispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those\ngroups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46\nF.3d l24o, l246 (2d Cir. l995).\n\nIn considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and\nreasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups\nare ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as\ncompared to the relevant community. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.\nl996).\n\nWhile Duren did not define which community is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,\nit is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l26 Filed ol/25/2l Page 9 of l3\nStates v.

The only geographic nexus in this case to this\nDistrict—Epstein’s New York residence—is in the Manhatan Division, and the case will be\ntried within the Manhatan Division. The appropriate comparison here is therefore between the\nManhatan Division and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel for White Plains.\n\nMr. Martin’s analysis found significant underrepresentation of both Black and Hispanic\npersons in the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel when compared to the eligible juror population of\nthe Manhatan Division. Mr. Martin found that the eligible juror population of the Manhatan\nDivision is 2o.92% Black and 28.o6% Hispanic (Martin Decl. § 2o), while the White Plans\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel refilled in February 2ol7 (and thus in effect in 2o2o) was 8.76% Black and\nlo.48% Hispanic (id. § 55). Thus, Mr. Martin found an “Absolute Disparity” of l2.l6%\nunderrepresentation for Black jurors (2o.92% minus 8.76%) and an “Absolute Disparity” of\nl7.58% for Hispanic jurors (28.o6% minus lo.48%). Jd. J] 6l-62. Mr. Martin also found\nsignificant underrepresentation using a “Comparative Disparity” analysis (id. J] 69-7o), which\nreflects a cognizable group’s absolute disparity as a percentage of the population percentage of\nthat group, and a standard deviation analysis (id. [§ 74-75), which measures the statistical\nsignificance of a group’s underrepresentation.\n\nMr. Martin further found that there would be significant underrepresentation even if the\nWhite Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel were compared to the eligible juror population of the entire\nSouthern District of New York. For the whole District, the eligible juror population is l8.o9%\nBlack and 23.4l% Hispanic. /d. § l9. Thus, when compared to the whole District, an absolute\ndisparity analysis of the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel shoued an underrepresentation of 9.33%\nfor Black jurors and l2.93% for Hispanic jurors. /d.

Regardless of whether the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel\nis compared to the eligible jury population of the Manhatan Division or to that of the entire\nSouthern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of\nBlack and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a\ngrand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhatan Division or the\nDistrict as a whole. This decision resulted in the systematic exclusion of eligible jurors residing\nin the southern counties of this District.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the\nManhatan Division or the entire District is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both\nBlack and Hispanic jurors in the White Plains jury wheel differs from that in the comparison\npopulation by more than three standard deviations. Martin Decl. {fj 74-75. According to Mr.\nMartin, if there is no systematic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a distinctive group,\nthe divergence of demographics should exceed three deviations only approximately o.5% of the\ntime. /d. § 73. Thus, the underrepresentations here are “not the result of random factors, chance,\nor luck” but “the result of a systematic process that under represents” each group. /d. 9] 74-75.\nSee Jackman, 46 F.3d at l248 (finding fair cross-section violation due to systematic exclusion of\nresidents from communities with large minority populations).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo233o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl26 Filed ol/25/2l Page ll of l3\n\nThus, regardless of whether the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel is compared to the\neligible juror population of the Manhatan Division or that of the entire District, Black and\nHispanic jurors are systematically underrepresented.

And complaints regarding\nmistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nRather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court’s directive, the MDC’s opposition\nshines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all\ninmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes\nbeyond deprivation of liberty.

Underrepresentation :\nThe second element under Duren examines whether the groups’ representation “in |\nvenires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such\npersons in the community.” 439 U.S. at 364. To answer this question, houever, the Court must\nfirst define the relevant variables, namely (a) the jury venire and (b) the community. |\nls Relevant Jury Venire |\nThe parties dispute which jury pool ought to be used to analyze the Defendant's fair\ncross-section challenge. Schulte relies on United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 648, and contends |\nthat the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel is the relevant jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 8.) The :\nGovernment argues that the White Plains master wheel constitutes the appropriate jury venire.\n(Gov’t Opp. Br. at l5.) The Court agrees with the Government. |\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’ |\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux, 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995) :\n(examining caselaw); see also Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458 (stating that the “Second Circuit has not :\nstated a preference for the use of one wheel over the other”). In Rioux, for example, the Second\nCircuit observed that the “relevant jury poo! may be defined by: (l) the master list; (2) the\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel; (3) the venires, or (4) a combination of the three.” 97 F.3d at 655-56.\nAithough the Rioux court did designate the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel as the relevant venire, see id.,\nthat conclusion only folloued because the parties agreed “that the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel may serve as\nthe relevant jury pool.” Jd. That is not the case here, so the Court finds Rioux to be of litle\nimpact.\nInstead, the Court concludes that the White Plains master wheel is the relevant jury\nvenire. As noted by the Government (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l6-l8) several district courts within this\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002830.jpg": "CaGadse2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRTaiehd FieebdR22e/? l Pafageod 2H 2o |\ncircuit have defined the relevant jury pool with reference to “the systematic defect identified by\nthe defendant.” Rioux, F.

Under that approach, the jury venire that bears |\nthe brunt of the defendant’s allegations of systematic exclusion is determined to be the relevant |\njury pool. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *5; Rioux, F. Supp. at l565-66. Here, Schuite’s | |\nallegations of systematic exclusion center almost entirely on the juror selection procedures for ,\nthe White Plains master wheel.* See infra l5-l7. Accordingly, the appropriate venire is the :\nWhite Plains master wheel.\ni. Relevant Community :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant community. According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id. Yet, what the statutory law leaves\n4 For example, if Schulte had alleged that the juror questionnaire form displayed systematic\nexclusion, see supra 4n. l, then the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel would be the appropriate jury venire for\ncomparison. Because he does not do that, the master wheel must be the relevant venire.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo283o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002836.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl Pafad® 65 BO 2o\nthe second element under Duren.® 439 U.S. at 364.\nB. Systematic Exclusion :\nApart from the second Duren element, Schulte’s fair cross-section challenge must also\nfail because he cannot meet the third element: systematic exclusion, which requires a shouing :\nthat the “underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection :\nprocess.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nIn Rioux, the Second Circuit explained that there is “systematic exclusion when the |\nunderrepresentation is due to the system of jury selection itself, rather than external forces.” 97\nF.3d at 658. Under the external forces principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as\n“demographic changes”) do not constitute systematic exclusion. /d.; see, e.g., Schanbarger v. :\nMacy, 77 F.3d l424 (2d Cir. l996) (per curiam) Gury selection process “drawn from voter\nregistration lists” did not constitute systematic exclusion); United States v. Litle Bear, 583 F.2d |\n2ll, 4l4-l5 (8th Cir. l978) (“inclement weather” in North Dakota that allegedly led to the\nunderrepresentation of rural jurors was not systematic exclusion); United States v. Jones, 2oo6\nWL 278248, at *3 (B.D. La. Feb. 3, 2oo6) (Hurricane Katrina’s alleged disparate impact on\npotential African-American jurors was not systematic exclusion). The lion’s share of Schulte’s\nsystematic exclusion allegations is foreclosed by this principle.\nFirst, Schulte contends that the Government systematically excluded African American\nand Hispanic American jurors by seeking the Indictment in White Plains in lieu of the more\nracially diverse Manhatan community. (Schulte Br. at 2.) But the reason the Government\n8 Bven if, as Schulte suggests, the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel is used as the relevant jury\nvenire, the absolute disparities would be 3.69% and 3.64%.

Discussion\n\nThe Government’s decision to seek an indictment of the defendant from a grand jury siting\nin White Plains was entirely appropriate and consistent with the Constitution, the JSSA, and the\nSDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest on a faulty premise: That a\ndefendant who is likely to be tried in the Manhatan courthouse must be indicted by a grand jury\nsiting in that same courthouse. That is not the law. See Section XI.C.l, infra.\n\nThat foundational error is fatal to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the proper\ncomparators are considered—the White Plains Master (or <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span>) Wheels to the voting age\npopulation of the counties from which juries in White Plains are drawn, rather than the defendant’s\napples-to-oranges comparison of the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Jury Wheel to the population of the\nManhatan “Division”’—the defendant fails to establish unfair underrepresentation under the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. Moreover, the defendant has not established that any disparity\nresulted from systemic exclusion of a particular group. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\nl. The Defendant Was Properly Indicted by a Grand Jury Siting in\nWhite Plains\n\nAt the heart of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim is her contention that the\n\nGovernment seeking an indictment from a grand jury siting in White Plains—which was the only\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 239\navailable grand jury that day, due to the global pandemic®*—“was a deviation from the established\npractice of indicting defendants in the division where the offense is alleged to have occurred and\nwhere the case will be tried.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 2). Because the offense is alleged to have occurred\nin the “Manhatan Division” and the defendant assumes that her jury trial will occur there too, she\nargues that the “appropriate comparison,” for the purpose of her fair cross-section claim, “‘is\ntherefore between the Manhatan Division and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel for White Plains.” (Def. Mot.\n9 at 6). This premise is faulty.\n\n“Tt is well-setled that neither the jury selection statute nor the Constitution requires that\njurors be drawn from an entire district.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (collecting cases); see also United\nStates v. Plaza-Andrades, 5o7 F. App’x 22, 26 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (“[O]Jur precedent makes clear that\nthe Sixth Amendment does not entitle a defendant to be tried in a geographic location any more\n68 This case was indicted on June 29, 2o2o, on which date the grand jury siting in White Plains\nwas the only available grand jury in the District. Beginning on or about June 25, 2o2o, grand jury\nquorums returned in Manhatan, but with substantially less availability than before the pandemic.\nAs a result, the Government has sought indictments from grand juries siting in White Plains and\nManhatan, as availability permits. In this instance, the Government was prepared to indict on\nJune 29, 2o2o, and the only grand jury available in this District on that day sat in White Plains.\nThe global pandemic’s effect on grand jury availability continues to evolve, but at no point have\ngrand juries in White Plains or Manhatan resumed normal activity.\n\nThe defendant speculates that the Government sought an indictment on June 29, 2o2o\nbecause of some arbitrary desire to arrest the defendant on July 2, 2o2o, one year to the day after\na grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging Jeffrey Epstein with federal crimes on July 2,\n2ol9. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 9 at l, 8). Seting aside the silliness of marking the anniversary of an\nindictment’s return, as opposed to the anniversary of the arrest itself, which took place on July 6,\n2ol9, there is no reality in the defense’s conspiracy theories. As the defense knous full well, the\nGovernment atempted to locate and arrest the defendant on July l, 2o2o but was unable to confirm\nher location until obtaining cellphone location data identifying her location and enabling her arrest\non July 2, 2o2o. The defense knous this because they have the warrant application that the\nGovernment submited on July l, 2o2o for the defendant’s cellphone location information, in\nwhich the Government stated that it had been unable to confirm the defendant’s location. In other\nwords, the Government indicted the defendant as soon as it was prepared to present the evidence\nit had gathered to a grand jury, and the Government arrested the defendant as soon as it was able\nto locate her after obtaining that indictment.\n\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 239\n\nIn sum, the decision to indict the defendant in White Plains was entirely proper, and the\nlack of any constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s contrary argument is fatal to her\nfair cross-section claims, as described belou.\n\nDe The Defendant’s Fair Cross-Section Claim Is Meritless\n\nThe defendant’s fair cross-section claim is based on the assertion that Black or African-\nAmerican and Hispanic or Latino individuals are unfairly underrepresented in the relevant jury\npool. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5). While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Duren’s first prong, the\ndefendant’s claim fails on each of the other two prongs.\n\na. The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics\nAre Unfairly Represented\n\nThe second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation\nof either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and\nreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.\nThis requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what\nis the community “population” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method\nof statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.\n\nHere, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span>\nWheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White\nPlains Master Wheel, but, as set forth belou, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White\nPlains <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel.\n\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995). Ina\ndetailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different\nrelevant pools, including the master wheel, the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel over a period of time, the venires\n\n2o5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 233 of 239\nappearing around the time of the defendant’s trial, or some combination thereof. /d. Ultimately,\nthe district court in Rioux found that the teaching of Duren and the Second Circuit’s subsequent\ncases is that “the court must assess representativeness in the context of the systematic defect\nidentified by the defendant.” /d. at l568. In that case, the claimed defects were in the construction\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel and, therefore, the “relevant jury pool” was the “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel over the\nlife of the wheel.” /d. at l575.\n\nAffirming that decision, the Second Circuit did not hold that the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel is\nnecessarily the “relevant jury pool.” Rather, after stating that the relevant jury pool “may be\ndefined by: (l) the master list; (2) the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a combination of the\nthree,” the Circuit noted that the parties had agreed that the district court properly used the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\nwheel over the life of the wheel as the “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657. The court’s\nacceptance of the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel as the “relevant jury pool” for that case—an issue which\nwas not in dispute—does not mean it necessarily must be applied in all cases. Jd. Indeed, in other\ncases where the claim of error was not focused on the construction of the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> wheel, different\n“relevant jury pools” have been used by the Second Circuit. Most notably, in Biaggi, the main\nthrust of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim was that reliance on voter registration lists\nsystemically excluded African-Americans and Hispanics from jury service—a claim which is\ndirected at the composition of the master wheel—and the Second Circuit identified the district’s\nmaster wheel as the relevant jury pool. United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o).\n\nHere, the defendant claims that “the primary reason” for the alleged underrepresentation is\nthe Government’s “choice to pursue an indictment from a grand jury drawn from the White Plains\nDivision, as opposed to the Manhatan Division . . . .” (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). Even if this argument\ndescribed a function of the jury selection process — though it does not — it would be directed at the\n\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 234 of 239\nhou the particular Master Wheel is selected. It says nothing about the process by which a Master\nWheel is reduced to the subset of <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jurors contained in the <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel. Because the\n“systematic defect” alleged by the defendant relates to the Master Jury Wheel, the White Plains\nMaster Jury Wheel is the appropriate “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 93o F. Supp. at l566-68.\n\nAlthough the Master Jury Wheel does not include reliable information regarding the race\nand ethnicity of the individuals selected from voter registration lists, the racial and ethnic makeup\nof the White Plains Master Jury Wheel can be estimated using geocoding and Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (“BISG”).© Taking into account those estimates, the White Plains Master\nWheel is ll.2o% Black or African-American and l2.97% Hispanic or Latino. (Siskin Aff. at §\n28). By contrast, the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel is 8.76% Black or African-American and\nlo.48% Hispanic or Latino. (/d. at § l7).\n\nThe community population for purposes of assessing representativeness is the population\neligible for jury service in the community. See, e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 524 (l975)\n(focusing on population eligible for jury service); Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657 (“We conclude that the\nappropriate measure in this case is the eighteen and older subset of the population ....”). But hou\nshould the relevant “community” be defined? The defendant contends that it is the jury eligible\npopulation of the “Manhatan Division,” because that is where the offense occurred and where she\nassumes she will be tried. (Def. Mot. 9 at 6). As set forth above, she is wrong.

Siskin, which was prepared for the\nGovernment in Balde.

Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F.

The “community population” is the\njury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% Black or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for Black or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black population and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244. See also id. at l252 (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision was “at\nodds with every decision in every circuit applying the Duren test’).\n\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 239\n\nThe result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The\nWhite Plains <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and\nlo.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § l7; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in\nabsolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within\nthe range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren\ntest. Moreover, as discussed belou, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains\n<span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,\nare not the result of systematic exclusion.\n\nIt is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains\n<span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhatan Division” or the entire Southern\nDistrict that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second\nprong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the\nsecond prong.\n\nb. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic\nExclusion\n\nEven assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she\nhas not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to\nsystematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis\nadded). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury\nselection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot\nsatisfy the third prong of Duren.\n\nAs then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply\nbecause a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”\nBarlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 4o; see also United States v. Barlou, 479 F. App’x 372, 373 (2d Cir.\n\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 239\n2ol2) (affirming Judge Bianco’s “thorough and well-reasoned” opinion). Indeed, “‘[a] selection\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic exclusion.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v. Superintendent\nRockview SCI, 939 F.3d 26o, 269 (2d Cir. 2ol9)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\n<span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\nexclusion . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any identified group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003414.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 348\nNPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the\nvictims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case.

The population for which the jury is meant\nto be representative is normally defined as the population of citizens of the United States who are\nat least l8 years old who reside in the community. To the extent there is a difference in\nrepresentation between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the community of African Americans or\nBlacks (referred to herein as African Americans) and of Hispanics or Latinos (referred to herein\nas Hispanics), I was asked to assess the cause(s) of the difference. I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\ndifference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the community.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American percentage of the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror questionnaire, and being found to be <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\nquestionnaire. Of the 3.69 percentage point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5. Tracking the percent African American and Hispanic individuals in the community\nthrough to the percent African American and Hispanic individuals on the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3623\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003624.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 4 of 3o\njury wheel, I was able to identify and measure the various causes of the absolute disparity\nbetween the community and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel.\n\n6. The first step in the process of analyzing the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel is to re-create the\nmaster jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the\nvoter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November l, 2ol6 county\nvoter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a\nproper random sample from the complete November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists would have\nbeen ll.88% African American and l3.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had\nbeen selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury\nwheel and the community would have been only o.57 percentage points, and the absolute\ndifference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have\nbeen only o.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the\ncommunity benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics\n\n7. As pointed out by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the\nmaster jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November l, 2ol6 voter registration\nlists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two\nreasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the\nManhatan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered\nvoters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess\nCounty, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons\nwere responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only ll.2o% African American and\n' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered\nvoters.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3624\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003625.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5 of 3o\nl2.97% Hispanic. Thus, the decision to not draw a proper random sample accounts for o.68% of\nthe absolute disparity between the actual master jury wheel and a random sample master jury\nwheel for African Americans and o.82% of the absolute disparity for Hispanics.\n\n8. Based on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it is evident that the percentage of\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics of the actual White Plains master jury wheel is similar to the\nestimate of the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics in the White Plains community.\nThe percent African American of the master jury wheel is l.25 percentage points louer than that\nof the community, (l2.45% versus ll.2o%) and the percent Hispanics of the master jury wheel is\nl.l5 percentage points louer than that of the community (l4.l2% versus l2.97%).\n\n9. Mr. Martin notes that the disparity between the master jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\njury wheel is impacted by a clerical error in transcribing the individual’s mailing address. This\nclerical error affected every county except Westchester. Houever, the impact of this clerical\nerror on the absolute difference between the master jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel for\nthe African American percentage is negligible, and the error actually reduced the absolute\ndifference between the master jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel for African Americans and\nHispanics.\n\nlo. In sum, as (l) the voter registration lists and the master jury wheel created from these\nlists reasonably mirror the representation of the community (an absolute disparity equal to or less\nthan l.25%), but (ll) because African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the\nquestionnaire used to determine if the potential juror was <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>, and/or (i) because African\nAmericans and Hispanics who responded were less likely to be found <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>, and/or\n(iv) because African Americans and Hispanics who were found <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> were more likely to be\nexcused, the absolute disparity between the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the White\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3625\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003626.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 3o\nPlains community benchmark for African Americans increased from l.25% to 3.69% and for\nHispanics increased from l.l5% to 3.64%.\n\nll. Mr. Martin also compared the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel for White Plains with the\nManhatan community and for the overall Southern District community. The White Plains\nmaster jury wheel is designed to be representative of the White Plains community, not the\nManhatan or Southern District community. The Manhatan and the Southern District\ncommunities are significantly more African American and Hispanic than the White Plains\ncommunity. Thus, since the White Plains master jury wheel is designed to be representative of\nthe White Plains community, by design it will not be representative of the Manhatan or the\nSouthern District community with respect to the percent African American and Hispanic.\n\nIV. DATA RELIED UPON\n\nl2. The data I received and relied upon is listed in Appendix B of this declaration.\nV. FINDINGS\nA. Overview of <span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Jury Wheel Selection Process.\n\nl3. The master jury wheel which forms the basis for the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel for the\nWhite Plains community of the Southern District of New York is supposed to be drawn via a\nsimple? random sample from the voter lists from the six counties (Westchester, Putnam,\nRockland, Orange, Sullivan and Dutchess) making up White Plains. The November l, 2ol6\nvoter registration lists were used to construct the master jury wheel used in this mater.\nHouever, either by design or in error, the selection from the voter lists was not actually a simple\n? A simple random sample is one where each person in the population has an equal probability of\nbeing selected.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3626\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003627.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 3o\nrandom sample. First, the inactive voters in all counties except Dutchess were excluded from\nselection. Assuming that they should have been considered, this exclusion resulted in the\nsample frame (the voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The\nsecond issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains community, three\ncounties feed both the Manhatan and White Plains master jury wheel, while three counties feed\nonly White Plains. The process for selecting for the White Plains master jury wheel from the\nthree non-overlapping counties was to select one out of every three voters, while the process for\nselecting from the three overlapping counties was to select one out of every 4.5 voters.* Thus,\nthe White Plains sampling methodology underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping\ncounties.°\n\nl4. If the sample from the voter registration lists had been a simple random sample, then\nthe master jury wheel would be expected to mirror that of the voter registration lists as of\nNovember l, 2ol6. Any difference would be due to chance as a result of random selection and,\ngiven the large number of selections, the difference due to chance should be trivial. Of course,\nthe master jury wheel could vary from the actual demographics of the community due to\n> There may be some valid reason for excluding inactive voters, but inactive voters from\nDutchess county were included in the selection process, and some inactive voters responded and\nwere on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel. Thus, I assume that the exclusion of the inactive voters was in\nerror and I explore the impact of this error in explaining any differences between the wheel and\ncommunity demographics.\n\n* The methodology was to first select the Manhatan wheel by selecting one out of every 3 voters\nfrom each county in the Manhatan community, and then for the overlapping counties to remove\nthose selected for the Manhatan wheel from consideration for the White Plains community and\nthen selecting one out of every 3 of the remaining voters. The result is that, considering all\nvoters in the county, only l out of every 4.5 are selected for the White Plains community.\n> The procedure may have been a compromise between having an overly burdensome process for\nvoters in the overlapping counties whose chances of jury selection would be twice that of voters\nin non-overlapping counties and the underrepresentation of voters in the overlapping counties in\nthe White Plains master jury wheel.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 3o\nsystematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity. That\nis, if African Americans or Hispanics are less likely (or more likely) to register to vote, then the\nselection from the voter lists would be expected to underrepresent (or overrepresent) African\nAmericans and Hispanics to the extent that the likelihood of not registering to vote differs among\nthe demographic groups.\n\nl5. Since jurors are always anticipated to be needed for future trials, at least once a year,\npersons on the master jury wheel are selected for possible jury duty via simple random sampling.\nThose randomly selected are sent questionnaires to determine their qualifications to sit as a juror.\nThe names of persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as\njurors are placed on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel from which jurors are selected, unless they are\ngranted an exclusion from jury service.

Based on the actual potential jurors’ responses concerning their race and ethnicity, the\nWhite Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel is 8.76% African American and lo.48% Hispanic.\n® Some small increase or decrease in the representation of African Americans and Hispanics\nwould be expected to occur by chance, but this is unlikely to have any meaningful impact of the\nabsolute disparity for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003629.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 9 of 3o\nl8.

The date on which the\ncomparable demographics of the community should be ascertained is unclear. Should it be the\npopulation as of November l, 2ol6 or some date thereafter? Of course, data on the population in\nthe community is not available for any specific date. The best one can do is look at the best\navailable data closest the appropriate date. The best data source is the latest available American\nCommunity Survey (ACS) data published by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The ACS collects survey\ninformation continuously nearly every day of the 5 years and then aggregates the results. The\ndata collection is spread evenly across the entire period represented, so as not to overrepresent\nany particular month or year within the period, but it does not measure the population at a single\npoint in time. The decennial census samples are designed to measure characteristics as of a\ncertain date (or a narrou time period). For example, Census 2olo was designed to measure the\ncharacteristics of the population and housing in the United States based upon data collected\naround April l, 2olo, and thus its data reflects a narrouer time frame than ACS data. If areas\nhave consistent population characteristics throughout the ACS time period, their period estimates\nmay not look much different from estimates that would be obtained from a “point-in-time”\nsurvey design. Houever, if areas experience significant changes in the characteristics of the\npopulation over the time period, ACS period estimates (especially for a 5- year period) may\nnoticeably differ from “point-in-time” estimates. I mention this only to point out that there will\n’ The 2ol9 ACS is due to be released to the public on December lo, 2o2o.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3629\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003630.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 3o\nalmost always be a disconnect between the estimate of the demographics of the community and\nthe demographics of the master jury wheel, simply because there will be a disconnect between\nthe timing of the two estimates.

After selecting\npotential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 3o\nselected and those selected are sent a questionnaire to determine if they are <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>. The names\nof persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as a juror,\nunless granted an exception from jury service, are then placed on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel from\nwhich potential jurors are summoned.\n\n23. What in this process could cause the difference in the percent African American and\npercent Hispanic between the benchmark and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel? Belou is a list of all\nlikely possible causes of such a difference. In considering the differences, I view the process as\nmoving sequentially from the voter registration lists to the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel, and I compare\nthe absolute disparity in the percent African American and Hispanic at each step with that of the\ncommunity.\n\n24. Reasons l-3 focus on the causes of the differences between a master jury wheel that\nis drawn from the voter registration list such that every registered voter in White Plains as of\nNovember l, 2ol6 had an equal likelihood of being included, and the community. Reasons 4-5\nfocus on the causes of the differences between the actual master jury wheel and such a randomly\ndrawn master jury wheel. Reasons 6-8 focus on the causes of the differences between the\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\nReasons:\n\nCommunity vs Randomly Selected Master Jury Wheel from Voter Registration Lists\n\nl) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because U.S.\n\ncitizens of voting age (i.e., the community) and those registered to vote (i.e., the master\n\njury wheel) are different.\n\n2) The estimate of the demographics of the community may differ from the demographics of\n\nthose on the voter registration lists because the estimates are from different times and also\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 3o\nbecause the voter list demographics are as of a specific point in time, while the\ncommunity estimate is over a five-year period of time (2ol4-2ol8).\n\n3) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because of\nchance in selection from the voter registration lists.\n\nRandomly Selected Master Jury Wheel vs Actual Master Jury Wheel\n\n4) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause the sample selection underweights the probability of selection from the counties\nfeeding both the White Plains and Manhatan master jury wheels. This is referred to as\nthe “prorating” issue.\n\n5) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause, in five of the six counties, the voter registration lists did not include inactive\nvoters. This is referred to as the “sample frame” issue.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Qualified</span> Jury Wheel vs Master Jury Wheel\n\n6) The <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because of clerical errors\nin transferring the mailing (alternative) address to the master jury wheel, which\npotentially results in not being able to properly reach some potential jurors on the master\njury wheel to determine if they should be placed on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel.\n\n7) The <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because being sent a\nquestionnaire, returning the questionnaire, and being found to be <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as a juror and\nnot excused are different by race or ethnicity.\n\n8) The <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel by chance resulting from\nthe random selection of those on the master jury wheel who will be sent a questionnaire.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 3o\nReasons 6, 7, and 8\n\n34. The last step in creating the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel is the selection from the master jury\nwheel of those deemed <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> and not excused. Reasons 6, 7 and/or 8 are the potential causes\nof any disparity between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\n35. Focusing on the difference between the master jury wheel and the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury\nwheel, one possible cause (reason 8) is that the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel differs from the master jury\nwheel because of chance in selecting persons from the voter registration lists to be sent a\nquestionnaire to determine if they are <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> and not excused and should therefore be moved\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel. While possible, it is not expected that the demographics of those\nmailed a questionnaire will meaningly differ from those not mailed a questionnaire. Any\nvariation should be random and equally likely to overrepresent or underrepresent any race or\nethnicity. Those mailed a questionnaire are chosen by a simple random sample drawn from the\nmaster jury wheel. Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.\n\n36. Houever, some difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the master jury\nwheel may be caused by the clerical error in transferring alternative mailing addresses to the\nmaster jury wheel (reason 6), which was noted by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin. Ifthe clerical\nerror disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics either positively or\nnegatively it could explain some of the difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the\nmaster jury wheel. That is, the clerical error failure to pick up the zip code from the alternative\naddresses on the voter registration list likely prevented the questionnaire from reaching those\nwho provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to\nrespond to the questionnaire, but we do not knou if the error affected more African Americans\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 3o\nor Hispanics or fewer. Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African\nAmericans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed\nquestionnaire because they did not receive the questionnaire due to this issue. I was able to\nidentify the persons on the master jury wheel whose questionnaire was mailed to the incomplete\nalternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the\nquestionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it\nonto the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\nestimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 percentage points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo percentage points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\njury wheel and the community.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the\ncommunity, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nrandomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the questionnaire, and/or\nthey are more likely to be found not <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as a juror when they return the questionnaire,\nand/or they are more likely to be excused when found <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>, and, hence, African Americans\nand Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury\nwheel (reason 7). As a result of this, the percent of African Americans on the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury\nwheel is 2.58 percentage points louer and the percent of Hispanics is 2.59 percentage points\nlouer. This accounts for all of the absolute difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and\nmaster jury wheel and 69.9% of the absolute difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the\ncommunity for African Americans and 7l.2% for Hispanics.\n\n38.

REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT\n\n39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury\nwheel and the estimated percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhatan, and\nthe overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then\ncompares the demographics of the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel to that of the White Plains\ncommunity, the Manhatan community, and the Southern District community.\n\n4o. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel\nand the White Plains community based on the 5-year 2ol8 ACS data, as I do. While I did not\ncompare the White Plains <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the Manhatan and Southern District\ncommunity estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. Houever, since the\npercent African American and Hispanic in Manhatan and the Southern District are significantly\nlarger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by\ndesign the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel will be significantly\ndemographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.\n\n4l. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random\nsample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,\ndue to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a\ndifferent selection rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on\nthe voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master\njury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who\nprovided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was\nthat voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the questionnaire,\npresumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo364l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22 of 3o\n\n42. While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their\nimpact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel. If\nhe had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which\nhe raises concerns explain relatively litle of the absolute disparity in the representation of\nAfrican American and Hispanic individuals between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel and the\ncommunity.\n\n43. Mr. Martin’s declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in\nthe community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is\nof litle value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing\nthem to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not\nwhether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2o2o who were\ntoo young to register to vote on November 2ol6, or persons who moved into the area after\nNovember 2ol6 are not on the November l, 2ol6 voter registration lists. Houever, the issue is\nnot who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November l, 2ol6 voter\nregistration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury\nwheel—that is based on the November l, 2ol6 voter population—and the benchmark for the\ncommunity—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also\nnot in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the\ncurrent community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the\ncommunity benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November\n2ol6 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the community demographics between\n2ol4 and 2ol8. The relevant question is what factors cause the difference he presents, and to\nwhat extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the community benchmark and the\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3642\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003643.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 3o\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> jury wheel. Mr. Martin’s presentation, unlike my analysis, never does this. Instead, he\ncherry picks issues which might impact the absolute disparity, but never measures the extent to\nwhich it does, or he simply cherry picks persons who are in the community currently but not in\nNovember l, 2ol6, without any atempt to update the community benchmarks.\n\nas ’\n[pe\nBernardR.

All the subpoenas requested by\nMs. Maxwell are under the strict procedures authorized by the Rule. The Court is keenly\naware of the standards necessary for the issuance of a Rule l7 subpoena and needs no\nassistance from the government in performing this gatekeeping function. Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel understand the scope and limitations of Rule l7 and have not requested anything that\nwould run afoul of the Rule.

The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal.

This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes.

Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v.

Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94).

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “extensive study of the relevant data and literature and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of child\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] reliability .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 84\nInstead, the Government will seek to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony as background in this case.\n“Daubert instructs that vigorous cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence are\nthe central tools available to an adversary who wishes to debunk an expert’s testimony.” Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE), Dkt. No. 335 at 37 (internal quotation marks omited) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S.\nat 594-595). Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.\nRocchio’s background testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering\ncontrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury\nunderstand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant\nand Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed disclosure.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\nThe parties agree that Dr. Rocchio is a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert. Her opinions are well within the\nrange of reasonable expert opinions, and so are sufficiently reliable to go to the jury. And they\nwill aid the jury in evaluating other testimony in this case. That is enough for the Court to admit\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony.\nII. The Evidence Contained in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l Leter is\n\nAdmissible\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government notified the defense of certain evidence it may offer\nat trial. In particular, the leter addressed and the expected testimony of one potential\nwitness. (See October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A). As the Government explained in its\nleter to the defense, the evidence constitutes direct evidence of the charged offenses, but the\nGovernment provided notice under Rule 4o4(b) in the alternative. That same day, the Government\nprovided the defense with i. along with copies of all other marked Government\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005978.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of 52\n\nB. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert” in something, she is not a “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial relationship with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6.

Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pageloof 4l\nthe traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people,\nplaces, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories,\nthoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic events(s).” (/d.)\n\ne Individuals with this subset of post-traumatic stress symptoms “are particularly\nunlikely to engage in continued communication or friendly gestures with an alleged\nperpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, or to unnecessarily\nrecreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit intense\ndistress.” (/d.).\n\nAs discussed belou, the Government objects that these opinions are either irrelevant or—to the\nextent intended to be applied to the context of this case—unreliable.\nB.

See Nimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 396 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oo5).\nTestimony from a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert is admissible only if the trial court determines that it is both\nrelevant and reliable. Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 589-9o; see Kumho Tire Co., Inc. v. Carmichael, 526\nU.S. l37 (l999). Specifically, in Daubert, the Supreme Court held that the Federal Rules of\nEvidence “assign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony both rests on a\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.” 5o9 U.S. at 597. “Daubert applies to both\ndefense and government experts.” United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l48 (2d Cir. 2oo3).\n\nApplying Rule 7o2, the Court must determine whether the expert’s reasoning and\nmethodology underlying his testimony is valid, and whether that reasoning or methodology was\napplied reliably to the facts, so as to be relevant and helpful to the jury. See Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.\nl37. The reliability inquiry is flexible and “must be tied to the facts of a particular case.” Jd. at\nl5o (citations and internal quotation marks omited). The Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘t\nis critical that an expert’s analysis be reliable at every step.” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R.R. Pass. Corp.,\n3o3 F.3d 256, 267 (2d Cir. 2oo2). “In deciding whether a step in an expert’s analysis is unreliable,\nthe district court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies,\nthe method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and hou the expert applies the\nfacts and methods to the case at hand.” /d.

But this commonplace truth does not need\ntestimony from a psychiatric expert.\n\nThe concept of hindsight bias is well within the ken of the average juror. “Hindsight bias\nis a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’” Adams v. Lab. Corp. of\nAm., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). The prevalence of this common saying shous that\njurors plainly understand the ways in which hindsight can bias one’s perspective. As such, expert\ntestimony on it is unnecessary and inappropriate. See id. (“[C]ommon-sense concepts are\nespecially appropriate for consideration by a jury.”); see also, e.g., United States v. Mulder, 273\nF.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that is directed solely\nto lay maters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited)). To whatever extent the Court believes further\nemphasis on this point is helpful, it can give the jury appropriate and neutral instructions to guide\nits deliberations. What the defense cannot do is skew the jury’s deliberations by puting an expert\nimprimatur on testimony that states, in effect, that the jurors should second-guess their assessments\nof the evidence because they are subject to hindsight bias. This inversion of the courtroom roles—\nin which a party’s witness sits in judgment of the jurors—is prejudicial and usurps the function\nboth of the jurors and of the Court in instructing the jury. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364\n(“Whereas an expert may be uniquely <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> by experience to assist the trier of fact, he is not\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to compete with the judge in the function of instructing the jury.”).\n\nIf Dr. Dietz’s testimony on hindsight bias is helpful to the jury in this case, testimony of\nthis sort would become central to the court system.

First, that perpetrators\nof sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part\nof a strategic patern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse.\nSecond, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their\nexperience as abuse and so prevent disclosure. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic\nand psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate\nsexual abuse of minors.

Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the\nAlpert Medical School of Broun University.

Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory identification of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue.

Rainey, 488 U.S. l53, l69 (l988)).\n\nUnder Daubert, a district court must first determine whether an expert is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>. See\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2 (“A witness who is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience,\ntraining, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise .. . .”); United States v.\nKidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“At the first step of the Daubert inquiry, courts\nare instructed to consider the expert’s qualifications.”).

Romano, 794 F.3d 3l7, 33o\n(2d Cir. 2ol5); see Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597 (explaining that courts must ensure “that an expert’s\ntestimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand”). On reliability,\nRule 7o2 identifies three “indicia of reliability”: (l) “that the testimony is grounded on sufficient\nfacts or data; (2) that the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) that\nthe witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United\nStates v.

Daubert itself, which “dealt with a scientific theory,” offered additional factors,\nsuch as whether the theory “‘has been subjected to peer review and publication,’” and the\n“knoun or potential rate of error.”” Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n593-94).

Discussion\nThe defendant does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert. Nor could she: Dr.\nRocchio is a leader in her field, teaching others as a professor at Broun University, and she has\napproximately twenty-five years of clinical experience. She is testifying in general about core\nconcepts in her field, based on her “extensive study of the relevant data and literature and her\nclinical experience treating hundreds of trauma and abuse patients over the past twenty years.”\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5 of 84\ntestimony in this case is readily distinguishable from that in Raymond. There, the government\ngave notice of expert testimony about the “behavior of child molesters” from a veteran FBI agent\nwho had reviewed case studies of child abuse and had writen one book and one article. /d. at l43,\nl45, l47. The purported expert’s book, in turn, merely made assertions about the “profile” of child\nmolesters, with no information about hou his experiences reliably led to his conclusions. /d. at\nl47-48. In the same breath, houever, the book “disavou[ed] [its] reliability .. . for legal use,” and\nhis article similarly offered generalized views on what “many” offenders were “more likely or less\nlikely to do.” Jd. at l48 (emphasis omited). Accordingly, at botom, the purported expert’s\ntestimony was based only on his subjective conclusions after reviewing case studies. See id. at\nl47 n.5 (explaining that the expert “troubling[ly]” wrote that “data is not the plural of anecdote,”\nbut “the information and opinions are based primarily on the totality of my acquired knouledge\nand expertise’).\n\nThe situation here is quite different. Dr. Rocchio’s conclusions are not anecdotal; they are\ngrounded in the academic literature and her formal and informal education. Moreover, she will be\ntestifying about concepts she regularly employs as a practicing clinician. Again, the defense does\nnot contest that Dr. Rocchio is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to be an expert on this subject. And Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are not an atempt to offer a “profile” of perpetrators of child sexual abuse or their\nactivities. Instead, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the psychological underpinnings of an\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6723\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 84\nInstead, the Government will seek to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony as background in this case.\n“Daubert instructs that vigorous cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence are\nthe central tools available to an adversary who wishes to debunk an expert’s testimony.” Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE), Dkt. No. 335 at 37 (internal quotation marks omited) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S.\nat 594-595). Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.\nRocchio’s background testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering\ncontrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury\nunderstand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant\nand Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed disclosure.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\nThe parties agree that Dr. Rocchio is a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert. Her opinions are well within the\nrange of reasonable expert opinions, and so are sufficiently reliable to go to the jury. And they\nwill aid the jury in evaluating other testimony in this case. That is enough for the Court to admit\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony.\nII. The Evidence Contained in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l Leter is\n\nAdmissible\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government notified the defense of certain evidence it may offer\nat trial. In particular, the leter addressed seven emails and the expected testimony of one potential\nwitness. (See October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A). As the Government explained in its\nleter to the defense, the evidence constitutes direct evidence of the charged offenses, but the\nGovernment provided notice under Rule 4o4(b) in the alternative. That same day, the Government\nprovided the defense with the relevant emails, along with copies of all other marked Government\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 52\n\nB. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nAccording to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential\nexpert, the government is right.\n\nBut saying that Rocchio is a “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert” is not enough. The government must\nidentify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 7o2; Fed. R. Crim. l6. As Ms. Maxwell\npointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.\n\nWhat’s more, even if Rocchio is a “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> expert” in something, she is not a “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\nexpert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the\nhuman brain or memory generally. Resp. at 3o n.7.) And as even the government admits,\nRocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators\nof sexual abuse. Resp. at l9, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged\nperpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”\n\nThe government atempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience\ntreating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’\nactions.” Resp. at l9.\n\nBut hou does Rocchio knou her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her\npatients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions\nare based on her treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes\nare telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial relationship with her.\n\nThe government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other\n“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at l6. If this were right, though, one would\nexpect the government to explain hou clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the\ntruth — in other words, hou clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Pagel5of 43 l5\nLalWmaxC\nl MS.

That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (transcript of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s construction of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case. To the extent the government contends these opinions don’t “fit,” that objection is flat-\nout wrong or at least premature, since the government hasn’t put any evidence on yet. Because\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo747o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page6of28\nthe government’s true objection is a question of fit, and because there is no dispute Dr. Dietz and\nDr. Loftus are <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>, this Court should deny the government’s motion.\nARGUMENT\n\n‘Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause... , or in the Compulsory Process or\nConfrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants\n“a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o\n(l986) (quoting California v. Trombeta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (l984)); see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v. Van\nArsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 68o (l986) (quoting Davis v. Alaska, 4l5 U.S. 3o8, 3l8 (l974)).\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of Dr. Deitz and Dr. Loftus’s\nproposed testimony.\n\nA witness who is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo747l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page /7 of 28\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nAs elaborated belou, the proposed testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus fall squarely\nwithin the ambit of Rule 7o2.\n\nI. Dr. Dietz’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government agrees that Dr. Dietz is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to offer expert opinion testimony under\nRule 7o2. Even so, the government hopes to limit his testimony by claiming that six categories of\nhis proposed opinions are either unreliable, irrelevant, or invade the province of the jury.\n\nThe government, though, is trying to have it both ways, by eliciting testimony from its\nexpert Dr. Rocchio while unfairly precluding Ms. Maxwell from responding. The government\nalso seeks to foreclose Dr. Dietz from offering opinions that are independently relevant to this\ncase, irrespective of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. To make its case, the government engages in the\ntime-honored practice of mischaracterizing a defendant’s position and then responding to the\nstrawman.\n\nThis Court should reject the government’s efforts, which, if successful, will deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to present a complete defense and to confront and cross-\nexamine her accusers. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 28\n\nThe government hopes Dr. Rocchio will fill in the gaps in the accusers’ stories by lending\nthe imprimatur of an “expert” to their allegations. The likely importance of her testimony to the\ngovernment’s case cannot be overstated.* Dr. Dietz, who the government admits is supremely\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>, should be alloued to challenge the reliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, explain why\nthey lack support, and opine about their limits. See Brooklyn Waterfront Terminal Corp. v. Int’l\nTerminal Operating Co., 2ll F. Supp. 7o2, 7o7 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd sub nom. Brooklyn Waterfront\nTerminal Corp. v. Int’l Terminal Operating Co. Inc., 3ll F.2d 22l (2d Cir. l962) (“As in all\ncases, this sharp conflict between the experts must be resolved by the trier of the fact.’’).\n\nB. Hindsight Bias.\n\nThe government appears to have two objections about Dr. Dietz’s opinions on hindsight\nbias: First, that the testimony improperly atempts to inform the jury what result to reach, and\nsecond that the testimony is “well within the ken of the average juror.” Mot. at l3-l4. The\ngovernment does not dispute the reliability of Dr. Dietz’s opinions, and as explained belou, Dr.\nDietz’s testimony is independently relevant and relevant in response to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony.\n\nThe government’s first argument once again misunderstands Dr. Dietz’s point. Dr.\nDietz’s opinion is about grooming. In his expert opinion, and at most, behavior can be labeled\n“srooming” only after the fact and retrospectively—that is, only after it is clear abuse occurred.\nEx. l, p 4-5. But the government’s burden in this case is to prove that, at the time the abuse\nallegedly occurred, Ms. Maxwell knew about it and intended to facilitate it. If Ms. Maxwell\n\n* So important are Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s opinions to the defense that the failure to\nconsult with and call them as witnesses would amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. See\nGersten v. Senkouski, 426 F.3d 588, 6o7-o8 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (defense counsel was ineffective in\nfailing “to call as a witness, or even to consult in preparation for trial and cross-examination of\nthe prosecution’s witnesses, any medical expert on child sexual abuse’’).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7477\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel7 of 28\ntestimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 7o2 expressly contemplates that an expert may be\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> on the basis of experience.”).\n\nThird, in admiting Dr. Rocchio’s testimony over an objection by Ms. Maxwell similar to\nthe one offered here by the government, this Court said as follous:\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\n\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms.\n\nMaxwell guilty... . It is the jury’s role to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s\n\nopinions apply to the facts of this case and the credibility of the witnesses.\n(Dkt. 435, p lo). The same logic applies to Dr. Dietz’s opinions.\n\nFinally, the government says the Dr. Dietz’s opinions don’t “fit the facts of the case.”\nMot. at 2l. But because the accusers’ stories have changed so much over the last twenty years,\nand because it’s still unclear what they will testify to at trial, this objection is premature at best.\nIf the government believes Dr. Dietz’s opinions do not “fit” the facts, this Court can consider that\nargument once there is evidence of what the facts really are.\n\nE. Dr. Dietz’s Alleged Opinions about the Accusers’ “Credibility.”\n\nNouhere in Dr. Dietz’s expert disclosure does he propose to opine on the credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s accusers. Ex. l. The government can argue otherwise only by mischaracterizing\nhis opinions. See Mot. at 22-23.\n\nFor one thing, Dr. Dietz should be able to critique Dr. Rocchio’s methods and\nconclusions by opining that experts in the field would not be “so credulous” as Dr. Rocchio is.\nSee Gov’t Omnibus Resp. to Maxwell Mot. in Limine, at l6; Ex. 2, p l6:ll-l6 (Dr. Rocchio: “In\nmy clinical practice, it’s not — I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It’s not\nmy job to go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear\nwhat they’re telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the\nscientific literature.”). Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that Dr. Rocchio erred in assuming that her\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 2l of 28\n\nThe issues in this case, by contrast, are far from simple: accusers making allegations\ndecades after the alleged events after reading, hearing, and speaking about the events with others,\nbarraged by media coverage, and motivated by monetary gain. Most of the accusers have spoken\npublicly and all have received large setlements from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund.\nTheir “memories” have changed dramatically over time and conveniently began to include Ms.\nMaxwell after retaining many of the same personal injury lawyers. None of the cases cited by the\ngovernment comes close to the issues presented here.\n\nDr. Elizabeth F. Loftus, Ph.D., is a distinguished professor and preeminent expert on\nmemory science, with extensive credentials and academic and research experience spanning\ndecades. She has published more than 2o books and over 6oo scientific articles and chapters, the\nmajority of which focus on the subject of memory.\n\nShe has been <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert and testified approximately 3oo times in civil and\ncriminal court cases and approximately loo times during depositions. Like Dr. Rocchio, she\nwould be testifying as a “blind” expert. Dr. Loftus will not testify about the credibility or lack\nthereof of any witness in this case nor will she testify about whether any particular memory of\nany witness is true or false or credible or mistaken. She will testify about hou human memory\noperates, the nature of the process of remembering as a reconstructive process, and the factors\nthat can cause memory distortion over time.\n\nAdmission of expert testimony on eyewitness identification and memory has significantly\nevolved, catalyzed by reversals due to DNA exoneration.° In 2ol3, the National Academy of\n\n> See, e.g., United States v.

This can occur when\npeople come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would\nidentify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.\n\nSuggestive activities can explain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory\nof sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having “memories” for numerous\nabusive acts, if the memories are false. She will explain the mechanism by which false and/or\ndistorted memories can be created as a result of post-event information and occurrences,\nsuggestion, influence or the like. She will also testify about the characteristics of false and/or\ndistorted memories. In particular “memories” can be described with confidence, detail and\nemotion, even when they are false. She will point out some of the suggestive activities that\noccurred in this case. She will explain hou media coverage and other publications (including but\nnot limited to newspaper and magazine articles, news reports, television shous, documentaries,\nbooks, podcasts, websites, etc.) and discussions/ conversations with others, can be sources of\nsuggestion. She will explain hou, in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the\nconstruction of distorted memories.\n\nB.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007898.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 3o of l5929\nLBAGmax2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl listservs to provide communication, and then creating a healthy\n2 clinical picture as well.\n\n3 Q.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\ncombination of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008090.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page5of25\n\nGhislaine Maxwell submits this Response to the Government’s Motion to Preclude the\nExpert Testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall, Bennet Gershman, Robert Kelso, John Lopez, Gerald\nLaPorte, and Jennifer Naso.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe government claims to bring its motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2. In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\nirrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\nrelevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall.

The government’s motion is not a Rule 7o2 challenge.\n\nThe government’s motion invokes Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2. That rule says:\n\nA witness who is <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\nFed. R.

Whatever it is, it is not a copy of Exhibit 52. (It\nhas, for example, several handwriten pages that aren’t contained in the government’s trial\nexhibit.) Quite simply, Ms. Maxwell was not asked and did not testify about Exhibit 52 or its\nauthenticity.\n\nThis is no trivial mater.

Because the Motion will be\nsealed for only a limited period of time and because the defense is not seeking to seal any hearing\nordered by the Court, there is no concern that the public will be permanently denied access to the\ndocuments or the relevant facts, or that the press will be unable to perform its role of monitoring\nthe federal courts.

Although the Motion contains some publicly available information and a discussion of\nthe relevant law, these portions of the Motion reflect the defense’s legal theories and interpretation\nof the facts and should not be disclosed to Juror 5o. For example, the defense’s selection of which\npublicly available facts to highlight in the Motion provide a roadmap of which topics the defense\nmight ask Juror 5o about at a hearing. Similarly, the Motion discusses the implications of certain\npublic statements Juror 5o has given in the past, which may impact the responses he gives to\nquestions at a hearing.

All of this will frustrate the truth-seeking process of any factual\ninquiry ordered by the Court and jeopardize Ms. Maxwell’s one chance to vindicate her right to a\nfair trial.\n\nFor the reasons set forth more fully belou, Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial is a “higher\nvalue” and a compelling interest that outweighs the public’s <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> right of access to the Motion\nunder both the common law and the First Amendment. The Court should therefore order that the\nMotion remain temporarily sealed until the Court rules on Ms. Maxwell’s Motion or until the\nconclusion of any hearing ordered by the Court, whichever comes first.!\n\nApplicable Law\n\nIt is well setled that the public and the press have a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> right of access to judicial\ndocuments filed in criminal and civil proceedings under both the First Amendment and the\ncommon law. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll9-2o (2d Cir. 2oo6);\nUnited States v. Silver, No. l5-CR-93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l4, 2ol6).\n“The presumption of access is based on the need for federal courts, although independent—\nindeed, particularly because they are independent—to have a measure of accountability and for the\npublic to have confidence in the administration of justice.” United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d\nlo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995) (“Amodeo IT’).\n\n! The defense anticipates that the government’s response will raise the same issues and will need to be sealed for the\nsame reasons. Accordingly, the defense further requests that that Court order the government to file its response\ntemporarily under seal to give the defense the opportunity to assert its position regarding sealing.\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo89o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008907.jpg": "Castat2o:2ooosRIBBAKINDOneunTeahav7o FlpiO2ma22 Reagedlofdt ll\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nFebruary l, 2o22\n\nPage 8\nother related submissions can be immediately unsealed at that point. Because the Motion will be\nsealed for only a limited period of time and because the defense is not seeking to seal any hearing\nordered by the Court, there is no concern that the public will be permanently denied access to the\ndocuments or the relevant facts, or that the press will be unable to perform its role of monitoring\nthe federal courts. See Amodeo IT, 7l F.3d at lo5o. The defense’s sealing request is therefore\nnarrouly tailored and outweighs the public’s <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> right of access to the documents. Lugosch,\n435 F.3d at l24 (sealing is justified if it is “necessary to preserve higher values” and if the sealing\norder is “narrouly tailored to achieve that aim’’).\n\nIt is also not feasible to file a redacted version of the Motion on the public docket in the\nmeantime. Although the Motion contains some publicly available information and a discussion of\nthe relevant law, these portions of the Motion reflect the defense’s legal theories and interpretation\nof the facts and should not be disclosed to Juror 5o. For example, the defense’s selection of which\npublicly available facts to highlight in the Motion provide a roadmap of which topics the defense\nmight ask Juror 5o about at a hearing. Similarly, the Motion discusses the implications of certain\npublic statements Juror 5o has given in the past, which may impact the responses he gives to\nquestions at a hearing. Finally, the case law cited reveals which legal theories the defense may\npursue, which may also impact Juror 5o’s responses.

Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagelo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009141.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 38 of 49\nnot have questioned Juror 5o during voir dire about his views about Dr. Loftus or memory, and it\nwould be inappropriate to do so nou.\n\nInstead, the inquiry of Juror 5o should be similar to the inquiry the Court conducted of\nother prospective jurors who answered “yes” to Question 48 of the juror questionnaire. For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the prospective juror to a blank\nversion of the questionnaire, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\nquestionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the questionnaire\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise.

Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s Questionnaire and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror questionnaire and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror questionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his questionnaire that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009820.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 22 of 49\nare few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial\njudge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the\nempanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). This is because the district court\n“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the\natmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quotations and citations omited) .\n\nHou, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 5o\nhad disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to\nsimilarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span>,\neight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,\nor sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follou-up questions (and sometimes\nonly one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial\nnotwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259,\n293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the\nCourt not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good\nreason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nThus, if Juror 5o had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court\nproperly would have asked follou-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 5o could be\nfair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence\nand the law. Here, because Juror 5o did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not\nhave occasion to ask such follou-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a\nlimited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 5o such questions. If Juror 5o credibly states that he\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 38 of 49\nnot have questioned Juror 5o during voir dire about his views about Dr. Loftus or memory, and it\nwould be inappropriate to do so nou.\n\nInstead, the inquiry of Juror 5o should be similar to the inquiry the Court conducted of\nother prospective jurors who answered “yes” to Question 48 of the juror questionnaire. For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the prospective juror to a blank\nversion of the questionnaire, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\nquestionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the questionnaire\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise.

After\nthe thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this Court, it is crystal clear that the defendant\nreceived a fair trial. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not\ndeliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake. And\nin any event, had Juror 5o accurately reported in his questionnaire that he had been a victim of\nsexual abuse, he would not have been struck for cause. Juror 5o repeatedly explained—yjust as he\ndid during voir dire—that he would be fair and impartial and would decide the case based on the\nevidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. Accordingly, under controlling Supreme\nCourt and Second Circuit precedent, the defendant cannot shou that Juror 5o harbored any bias\nagainst the defendant. Moreover, during voir dire, multiple other potential jurors in this case\nreported having experienced sexual abuse and were nonetheless <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as jurors without any\nobjection from the defendant. It was entirely appropriate for Juror 5o to sit on this jury, and nothing\nabout his service as a juror calls into question the integrity of the verdict in this case.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l2 of l6\n\nhis ability to render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial and the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law, and that “[a]bsolutely in no way” would his experience with prior sexual\nabuse interfere with his ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. (/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)). At worst, Juror 5o’s expectations about\nthe consequences of his interviews reflect naivety; they do not reflect deception.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 8 of 4o\nthe Court asked if Juror 5o had any doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides.

The Defendant used all\nof her strikes. See Nov. 29, 2o2l Trial Tr. at 73l-32.

But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing\nconducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on\nthe rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is\nnot the case here.

Moreover, the\nproposed redactions would not safeguard the interests the Defendant points to. The\ndecisionmaker—the Court—will have access to unredacted copies of the documents, so the only\naccomplishment of the proposed redactions will be to obscure information from public view.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter motion to\npreclude testimony by Forensic Examiner Stephen Flatley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThere is no reason to exclude any of Flatley’s expected testimony or to delay his cross-\nexamination. The Government believes that Flatley’s expected testimony does not constitute\nexpert opinion testimony. Houever, even if some aspect of his testimony were characterized as\nexpert opinion, the Government has provided sufficient notice for such testimony and Flatley is\nundisputedly <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to give it. And there is certainly no reason to preclude his testimony based\non the defendant’s late-breaking objection.\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nOn September l5, 2o2l, the Government wrote the defendant a leter notifying her that it\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011181.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2 of lo\nexpected to call Flatley as a witness at this trial. The Government explained that, although the\nGovernment believed that this testimony would not require admission through Rule 7o2, the\nGovernment nonetheless provided notice in an abundance of caution. In addition to the summary\nof Flatley’s testimony identified in the defendant’s leter (Def. Leter at l-2), the Government\nidentified four cases in which Flatley “previously testified regarding similar topics,” including\nmetadata and hash values. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr. 643 (PKC)\n(describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. DiTomasso, l4 Cr. l6o (SAS)\n(describing hash values); see also ll/23/2l Tr. at 22 (directing the defense to “have your expert\nlook at the testimony that [Flatley’s] provided” to see if “he’s got some differing expert opinion’).\nFlatley was <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert in some of those cases; in others he was not.\n\nThe defendant did not raise a Rule l6 objection to this expert notice after the Government\nbegan producing 35oo material on October ll, 2o2l. Nor did the defendant raise an objection on\nOctober l8, 2o2l—the time designated for filing motions in limine. Cf Mot. to Exclude\nTestimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio, Dkt. No. 443. Instead, the defendant first complained about the\nsufficiency of the notice at the final pretrial conference on November 23, 2o2l—less than a week\nbefore the start of trial. See ll/23/2l Tr. at 2l-23. The Government quickly responded to the\ndefense’s notice concern, and three days later, the Government provided the defendant with a leter\nthat summarizes Flatley’s expected direct testimony and identified the Government exhibits about\nwhich Flatley was expected to testify. (Def. Leter at 2-3). That November 26, 2o2l, leter, which\nis atached as Exhibit A, continues to reflect Flatley’s expected direct testimony, although the\nGovernment may not ask about all of the exhibits mentioned therein.\n\nOn November 27, 2o2l, the defendant wrote the Government a leter in which the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooll8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 3 of lo\ndefendant claimed that the Government’s supplemental leter was untimely and simultaneously\nsupplemented the defendant’s expert notice for Forensic Examiner Robert Kelso. Notwithstanding\nthe anticipated objections, the defendant waited more than a week and filed a motion to preclude\nat approximately 9:45 p.m. the night before Flatley is expected to testify.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\n“The Federal Rules of Evidence allou the admission of fact testimony so long as the\nwitness has personal knouledge, while opinion testimony can be presented by either a lay or expert\nwitness.” United States v. Cuti, 72o F.3d 453, 457-58 (2d Cir. 2ol3). “The initial question is\ntherefore whether the contested testimony should be characterized as fact or opinion,” which is a\ndistinction that is “at best, one of degree.” Jd. at 458. The admission of fact testimony is governed\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 6o2, which requires that the witness have “personal knouledge of the\nmater.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o2. The admission of expert testimony is governed by Rule 7o2, and\napplies to witness who offer opinions who are “<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert by knouledge, skill,\nexperience, training or education.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nWhere a witness will offer expert testimony, the Federal Rules require the proponent to\n“describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s\nqualifications.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G), (b)(l)(C). As the l993 amendments to Rule l6 note,\nthe Rule is meant to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony,\nreduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the\nmerit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Jd. l993 Amend. “Ifa party\nfails to comply with Rule l6, the district court has broad discretion in fashioning a remedy ... .”\nUnited States vy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7), abrogated on other grounds by\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll82\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page5 of lo\n\nhim to handle the ‘sheer amount of data that was produced.’” Jd. at 84. He then conducted a\n“comparative analysis,” and “concluded that determining the provenance of the Digital Music files\nrequires conducting an individualized inquiry on a track-by-track basis.” Jd.; see id. at 85\n(describing the steps the witness had taken); cf’ United States v. Ganier, 468 F.3d 92o, 924, 926\n(6th Cir. 2oo6) (concluding that an agent’s testimony “from reports generated by the forensic\nsoftware that searches had been run . . . using search terms relevant to the grand jury investigation”\nrequired specialized knouledge to “make sense of the software reports’’).\n\nThe Government understands, houever, that this line is difficult to draw, and some\ndiscussion of the investigative steps Flatley has taken could be understood as testimony relying on\nhis technical knouledge. For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata. See Trial Tr. at 935-38, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr. 643 (PKC) (describing\nl The defense does not appear to dispute that Flatley could be <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> as an expert witness in this\nsubject; their objection is only one of notice.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagelof8\nU.S. Department of Justice\noe\nes United States Atorney\nty Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

The defendant’s unprecedented\nrequest seeks relief for an issue that arises in a large number of cases, and that relief is not necessary\nto protect the defendant’s constitutional rights. Accordingly, the Government opposes the motion.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is “firmly established” that “the press and general public have a constitutional right of\naccess to criminal trials.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk County, 457 U.S.\n596, 6o3 (l982); see United States v.

Disclosure of the document in advance of\ntrial would prevent the unnecessary delay of having a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> forensic document examiner take\npossession of the document, run tests, and offer an opinion during the middle of trial.\n\nRequest lo, the Boots\n\nThe Court directed the government “‘to notify the Court of its views” regarding item lo.\nInstead of notifying the Court of its “views” the government, houever, has taken steps to\ncircumvent the pending defense subpoena request; it is “working to moot request lo” by having\nthe FBI secure the boots, Dkt. 269, p.2. This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original\nrequest was ex parte, nou the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms.\nMaxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of\nevidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the\nsubpoena, not to the government.\n\nRequest ll, the Photographs\n\nRegarding item ll, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical\npositions. In its leter of May 4, 2o2l, the government first advised the Court that it obtained\n“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.\nTwo days later it admited that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution\nTeam’s possession” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-3 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of3\nincluding statutes of limitations and prior setlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary\nrequirements.\n\nImportant features of the Program include:\n\nl. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by\nthe Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making\nauthority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no\nauthority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,\nand the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.\n\n2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A\nvictim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by\nthe Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against\nthe Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.\n\n3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to\nthe Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submited, but\nwill not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law\nenforcement, or anyone else.\n\n“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September llth and other similar programs has\nprovided us with invaluable insight into hou to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the\nlife-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,\n“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the\nspecific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that\nJordy is uniquely <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time\nclaims experience and service to victims in the 9/ll community will serve this Program and\nEpstein’s victims well.”\nBeginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information\nto individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein\nand/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been\nidentified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by\nregistering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2o2l.\nThe Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)\non November l4, 2ol9. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,\nincluding victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was\npresented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2o2o. The final protocol was approved by the\nProbate Court on June 3, 2o2o.\n\"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative\ndesign.

This leter was identical to the VNS form notice\nleter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the\ncase as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The leter listed the eight\nCVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she\nwas unaware the FBI sent the leter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had\nidentified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the\naccuracy of the FBI leter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told\nOPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2oo8, and “at this point we\nweren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically\nsuspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”\n\nD. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Leter\nabout Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal\nInvestigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan\n\nIn anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November l6, 2oo7, to\nAcosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek, that the State Atorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify\nvictims of the state plea hearing.\n\n[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications.

For example, one would not\ncooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third\nclaimed she had no contact with Epstein.\naul Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or\ntwo victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”\n\n2l2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021708.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page6l of 93\n48\n\ndefinition of an “aggravated felony” under federal im-\nmigration law, Kawashima v.

The Jury Selection Process\n\nIn November 2o2l, in advance of trial, 694 jurors\ncompleted a juror questionnaire approved by the Dis-\ntrict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and consisted of 5l questions, many of\nwhich contained subparts. (A.29o-3l7). After the par-\nties reviewed the questionnaires, 23l of the 694 pro-\nceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court\nthen examined prospective jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury questionnaire that prospective\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the prospective jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.7l7). Of the 58 indi-\nviduals who were <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> to serve as jurors, eight in-\ndividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-\ntionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021711.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page64 of 93\n5l\n\nsexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,\nand that this experience would not affect their ability\nto serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.\n(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.l8, 52, 2oo, 2o7, 259, 293, 532,\n538-39, 635). Each confirmed that he or she could be\nfair and impartial, and defense counsel did not move\nto strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer\nto Question 48. (A.345).\n\nFor instance, one juror said that she was “sexually\nmolested by an uncle when she was l2 or l8,” but that\nwould not affect her ability to be fair and impartial in\nthe case. (A.345). Another juror indicated that she had\nrecently “reported that a friend was being coerced and\nsexually abused by a professor,” but confirmed that ex-\nperience would not “in any way interfere with her abil-\nity to be fair and impartial” in this case. (/d.). Neither\nthe Government nor defense counsel challenged those\njurors for cause.\n\nThe parties then exercised their peremptory\nstrikes, and a jury was seated.\n\n2. Juror 5o\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire and was\nquestioned by Judge Nathan during voir dire. In his\nquestionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he\ncould be fair and impartial. In response to Question l3,\n\nl2 Twelve of the 58 <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> prospective jurors in-\ndicated that a friend or family member had been a vic-\ntim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual as-\nsault.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021773.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page3l of 35\nthat he did not see that key questions related to sex abuse and his belief that they\nonly applied to others and not to him beggars belief since the process was to\ndetermine if he was to be a <span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> juror.

He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\n<span class=\"highlight\">qualified</span> technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023484.jpg": "OIG Official Draft Report: BOP’s Care, Custody, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC New York,\nNew York\nJune 22, 2o23\nPage 3 of 3\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate\nwhereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when\nconducting a round.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.\nRecommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address\nstaffing shortages at its prisons.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
