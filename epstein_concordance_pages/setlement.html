Mr. Epstein has\nscrupulously fulfilled his obligations in every jurisdiction in which he was required to register\nthroughout the lo-year hiatus between his release and present arrest. All of his travel has been\nmeticulously reported to the registration authorities so that they have been aware of his precise\nlocation every single day for the past lo years. Beter still, the pending charges date back l4-l7\nyears, from 2oo2 to 2oo5. Yet, tellingly, they allege no recurrence of the conduct underlying the\nNPA and Florida state conviction at any time in the ensuing decade and a half (2oo5-2ol9).\nTogether, these unique factors are pouerful indicia that Mr. Epstein is no longer a danger to\nanyone and will faithfully obey all conditions of release if ordered.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Epstein has substantial grounds to challenge the allegations charged by the\ngovernment in its indictment, and he has every intention of doing so in a lawful, professional,\nand principled manner. He intends to fight the current charges on their merits and, more, to\ncontest their legality given the inextricable intertwining of the current investigation and his NPA\nwhich promised him immunity and a global <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> for offenses including those brought\nunder l8 U.S.C. § l59l.

Statistically, GPS monitoring is more effective than RF monitoring at\npreventing recidivism.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F.

Maxwell also\nlearned that, to overcome the strictures of the Protective Order, the government had instituted an\nex parte proceeding before ee (S.D.N.Y). HH.\nNeedless to say, neither Maxwell nor her atorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that\napplication or to contest the government’s representations in support of the application. This was\nall in direct violation of Paragraph l4 of the Protective Order, which provides that the order may\nbe modified by the court only “for good cause shoun follouing notice to all parties and an\nopportunity to be heard.” Ex.

Because the subject mater of the antitrust case overlapped with an\nongoing state criminal antitrust case, the state Atorney General moved to intervene in the private\nantitrust case, to modify the seal orders, to access the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> material, and to present the\nmaterial and testimony to a state grand jury. /d. at 862. The district court granted the Atorney\nGeneral’s request, but the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed. Id. The Second Circuit\nrecognized that the state Atorney General, like the federal government, “enjoys a similarly\nprivileged position with respect to its investigatory pouers.” /d. at 866. Those pouers, in turn,\n“raise[d] a rebutable presumption against modification of the orders.” /d.

The investigation was\nprompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to\nEpstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with Epstein.

For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo329o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003291.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll5 of 348\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!°7\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB.

A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\nselection of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry\n\nthat the defense’s atacks on me could harm the victims.\nSloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in\nproposing the private atorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad\nhominem atacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have\naccomplished.”\nsl Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.\nl48 The Addendum is atached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 229 of 348\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”** Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7®°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”4**\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°6\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR- oooo346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nApp.-o823\n9\nG4LMGIUC\n\nl review so you are aware of the ongoing investigation.

Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, as a\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004413.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll6 of 349\nthat Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta was previously\nscheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October ll and to speak at the Palm\nBeach County Bench Bar conference the follouing midday, and that he stayed overnight at the\nMarriot.\nlB Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury maters.\nl8 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2o of 349\nWhy don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him?\nAcosta also weighed in, sending both Villafafia and Sloman an email with a subject line\nthat read “This has to stop,” in which he stated:\n\nJust read the leter.\n\nl.

A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\nselection of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case. . . . But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry\n\nthat the defense’s atacks on me could harm the victims.\nSloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in\nproposing the private atorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad\nhominem atacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have\naccomplished.”\nsl Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.\nl48 The Addendum is atached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 23o of 349\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.””* Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case. . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.”*”\n288 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004535.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 238 of 349\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 286 of 349\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . . ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\nae As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n‘o5 Villafaia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n259\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Pagelof2l\nUSDCSDN¥\nDOCUMENT |\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOC #:\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DATE FILED:_ 6/25/2o2l ||\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-cr-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION & ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Ferman that he still believed that a prosecution was permissible as long as\nCosby’s depositions were not used in such proceedings. Former D.A. Castor explained\nto the court that he meant that a prosecution may be available only if other victims were\ndiscovered, with charges related only to those victims, and without the use of Cosby’s\ndepositions in the Constand mater. Specifically, former D.A.

Thus, the\nCommonwealth argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that “[i]Jt was not necessary for\nthe trial court to specifically state that it rejected .. .

Stipetich, 652 A.2d l294 (Pa. l995).\n\nIn Stipetich, Pitsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich\nthat, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no\ncharges would be filed against them.

Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving\nevidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v. Arizona,\n384 U.S. 436, 473 (l966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 33o (Pa. l972).\nThe fact that Cosby did not assert any right to remain silent to the police or while siting\nfor the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by\nD.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That\nCosby did not do so at other junctures is not proof that he held the right but elected not\nto invoke it, as the trial court evidently reasoned. To assume an implicit waiver of the\nright violates a court’s “duty . . . to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen,”\nand to construe the existence of such rights broadly. Taylor, 23o A.3d at lo64 (quoting\nBoyd, supra).\n\nThese legal commandments compel only one conclusion. Cosby did not invoke\nthe Fifth Amendment before he incriminated himself because he was operating under the\nreasonable belief that D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute him meant that “the\npotential exposure to criminal punishment no longer exist[ed].” /d. at lo65. Cosby could\nnot invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances\nthat he faced no risk of prosecution. Not only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision\nnot to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he\nwas forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil atorneys with evidence of Cosby’s\npast use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered\nCosby’s ability to defend against the civil action, and led to a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> for a significant\namount of money. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the\ndistrict atorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether\nthat reliance was reasonable. Unreasonable reliance warrants no legal remedy.\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo488o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 77 of 8o\nOur disagreement with the CDO arises concerning its view that mere suppression of\nCosby’s deposition testimony will remedy his constitutional harm and “fully” restore him\nto where he stood before he detrimentally relied upon D.A. Castor’s inducement.*' This\nperspective understates the gravity of Cosby’s harm in this case, and suppression alone\nis insufficient to provide a full remedy of the consequences of the due process violation.\n\nThe CDO would limit our assessment of the harm suffered by Cosby to the\nCommonwealth's use of the deposition testimony at his two trials. But the harm is far\ngreater than that, and it began long before even the first trial. It must be remembered\nthat D.A. Castor’s decision not to prosecute Cosby, and to announce that decision orally\nand in a writen press release, was not designed to facilitate the use of testimony against\nCosby in a future criminal trial. Instead, D.A. Castor induced Cosby’s forfeiture of his Fifth\nAmendment rights as a mechanism and a lever to aid Constand’s civil action and to\nimprove the chances that she would receive at least a monetary benefit for the abuse that\nshe suffered, given that D.A. Castor had determined that Constand would not, and could\nnot, get relief in a criminal trial. Through his deliberate efforts, D.A. Castor effectively\nforced Cosby to participate against himself in a civil case in a way that Cosby would not\nhave been required to do had he retained his constitutional privilege against self-\nincrimination. To say the least, this development significantly weakened Cosby’s legal\nposition. Cosby was compelled to give inculpatory evidence that led ultimately to a multi-\nmillion dollar <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>. The end result was exactly what D.A. Castor intended: Cosby\ngave up his rights, and Constand received significant financial relief.\n\nUnder these circumstances, where our equitable objective in remedying a due\nprocess violation is to restore an aggrieved party to the status he held prior to that\nviolation, exclusion of the deposition testimony from a third criminal trial, and nothing\nsid atS\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004927.jpg": "‘ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 4 of 27\n‘ To Be Filed Under Seal\npursuant to the parties’ stipulation.

The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA. Regardless of hou the witness covered by the NPA\n23 might testify, that witness will remain protected under the NPA\n24 in the Southern District of Florida, and as I already ruled,\n25 the NPA does not provide protection in the Southern District of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 25 of l27 25\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl New York.\n\n2 Similarly, no mater hou a witness who has a\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> or financial incentive testifies, those benefits are\n4 not received under the NPA, so I don't see any theory of bias\n\n© that would be relevant that the defense has articulated with\n\n6 respect to the NPA.\n\n7 Moreover, even if there were some relevance, it would\n8 be substantially outweighed by a significant risk of 4o3\n\n9 prejudice from introducing the NPA. The jury would need to be\nlo instructed on what the non-prosecution agreement is, and would\nll need to have its terms explained. In particular, NPA, of\n\nl2 course, is controversial and complicated and has a complicated\nl3 background. There's a risk of undue delay, juror confusion,\n\nl4 and improper suggestions of sympathy or nullification made to\nl5 the jury on the basis of the NPA.\n\nl6 I will be clear, it's not clear to me the NPA could\n\nl7 never be admited, but the rationale nou provided by the\n\nl8 defense in its papers does not justify admission based on the\nl9 balancing of 4ol and 4o3 factors.\n2o Fourth guidance: The government's charging decisions\nal are likely not relevant and therefore inadmissible. The\n22 government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell by the end of the Florida\n23 investigation, and the government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell\n24 when it indicted Jeffrey Epstein originally in New York.

The final issue in the government's\n2o motion is request to preclude the defense from arguing that the\n2l defendant was a \"prevailing party in civil litigation.\" I will\n22 grant this motion.

If the defense elicited that the defendant was the\nl3 prevailing party, a layjuror would almost certainly assume that\nl4 that was some kind of adjudication on the merits relevant to\n\nl5 this case but there is no evidence that there was any relevance\nl6 adjudication on the merits and certainly none relevant to the\nl7 case.

Any and All Material Submited to the EVCP\n\nThe defendant makes a further request for any and all submissions by the Minor Victims\nto the EVCP. This request would not generate relevant, admissible evidence for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the defendant has not identified a theory by which these materials are relevant and\nadmissible. The defendant argues primarily that the materials contain relevant impeachment\ninformation because “[f]ull and complete cross-examination is impossible without understanding\nthe complete terms of the agreement with the Epstein Fund, including the claims concerning\nMaxwell, as well as others.” (Def. Mot. at 6). Materials are not relevant and admissible at trial,\nas required by Nixon, simply because they aid the defendant’s “understanding.” And the defendant\narticulates only one theory by which EVCP materials may be admited to shou bias. According\nto the defendant, the May 2o2o Protocol governing the EVCP states that claims are evaluated\ndepending on whether “there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the\nappropriate . .. United States Atorneys’ Office or other law enforcement agency.” (Def. Mot. at\n5). If this “prosecution against [the defendant] went forward,” the argument goes, the Minor\nVictims and their lawyers would “benefit.” (d.)\n\nThe defendant already has the information relevant to this argument. She has the protocol\nfor the EVCP. The Government has “offered” no “information” or “findings” to the EVCP about\nthe Minor Victims; to the extent the EVCP relied on publicly available information about this case\nto make its determination, such as the charging instruments in this case, that information is in the\npublic record. And the Government has already disclosed to the defendant the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of8\nPage 5\n\namounts—which the defendant cites in her motion. (Def. Mot. at 5). Thus, if these records are\nrelevant at all, they are “otherwise procurable.” Pena, 2ol6 WL 8735699, at *2.4\n\nThe defendant also argues that the subpoenaed records contain prior statements of the\nMinor Victims, presumably suggesting that they may be admissible as prior inconsistent\nstatements. (Def. Mot. at 4). This argument misses the mark. Any statements in the EVCP’s files\nare unlikely to be inconsistent in light of the context in which they were made. See United States\nv. Barrou, 4oo F.3d lo9, l23 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (citing United States v. Strother, 49 F.3d 869, 875\n(2d Cir. l995) for the proposition that an omission in a prior statement “should have been admited\nas an inconsistent statement because it would have been natural for the witness to include the fact”\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omited)). In order to initiate a proceeding with the\nEpstein Victims Compensation Fund, a victim must articulate a claim “directed against Epstein.”\n(Indep. Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program Protocol, Def. Mot. Ex. l Atachment A Ex. | at\n3 (emphasis added)). And in that context, it would be wholly unsurprising if victims spoke at\ntimes about their experience with Epstein without discussing the defendant.° Further, if it were\ntrue (as the defendant argues above) that EVCP funds will reveal the Minor Victims’ bias because\ntheir recovery from the EVCP was aided by the Government’s continued case against the\ndefendant, one would expect that any statements by the Minor Victims to the EVCP regarding the\ndefendant would be consistent with their statements to the Government and at trial. If the Minor\n* Indeed, because all four Minor Victims identified in the subpoena have resolved their claims with\nthe EVCP, there is no reason to think their trial testimony will be biased in order to advance their\nclaims in a nou-completed <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process.\n> Consider, for instance, if a victim met Epstein and the defendant together on a certain date. It\nwould be entirely consistent for the victim to testify as much on the stand, and to tell the EVCP\nthat she “met Epstein”—without mentioning the defendant—on that date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 367 of 375\nLaPorte CV (Version 2o2o.3) Page l4 of l9\n\nl5.

And any privilege that may have existed was waived\nwhen Mr. Glassman shared Jane’s statement with the government. See Fed. R. Evid. 5o2(a);\nSteinhardt Partners, 9 F.3d at 236; l McCormick on Evid., § 93.\n\nThere is a third category of relevant communications. During cross-examination, Jane\ndenied knouing that after the EVCP made its $5 million offer to setle, Mr. Glassman went back\nto the EVCP on her behalf to seek more money. TR at 558:8-l7. In fact, Mr. Glassman did\nexactly that. He originally demanded $25 million for Jane from Ms. Maxwell. Jane then filed a\nclaim with the EVCP, which offered $5 million. Mr. Glassman replied to the EVCP that Jane “‘is\na sophisticated claimant who knous the value of her claim is worth a lot more than $5 million.”\nMr. Glassman then demanded a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> in the eight figures. Because Mr. Glassman\ncommunicated these demands to a third party, the first demand to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel and the\nsecond to the EVCP, and because these communications were not between Mr. Glassman and his\nclient, the exchanges are not protected by the atorney-client privilege and, even if they were, any\nprivilege was waived.\n\nFinally, there can be no argument that AUSA Rossmiller’s statements to Mr. Glassman,\nand Mr. Glassman’s statements in response, which do not repeat or refer to statements by Jane,\nare not privileged. The exchanges between AUSA Rossmiller and Mr. Glassman are not\n“communication[s] between client and counsel.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9.\n\ntk OOK ok\n\nMs. Maxwell has a constitutional right to compulsory process and to present a defense.\n\nU.S. Const. amends.

The\ndefendant would call Glassman to testify that he originally demanded a higher <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> from the\nEVCP. As the Court explained when the defendant raised this very issue at a break on December\nl, “there are personal knouledge questions in issue.” (Tr. 489). On cross, defense counsel asked\nJane if she knew whether her atorney asked the EVCP for more money, and she said she did not\nknou. (Tr. 558). Today, as on December l, evidence of Glassman’s negotiations with the EVCP\n(or the defendant) go to Jane’s bias only if Jane was aware of them. Jane testified that she was not\naware of them, and the evidence the defendant would elicit from Glassman would not cure that\ndefect. It is therefore improper impeachment. And for Glassman, as for Scarola and Edwards, the\nsuggestion that the jury should infer that Jane and Glassman had certain privileged conversations\nthat affect Jane’s knouledge from the fact that Glassman had other exchanges with other\nindividuals is more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nIl. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should preclude testimony from Jack Scarola,\nBrad Edwards, and Robert Glassman.\n\n3 The defendant also argues that Glassman’s exchanges with the Government that “do not repeat\nor refer to statements by Jane” are not privileged. (Def. Leter at 8). Glassman’s statements in the\nemail are “Hey [prosecutor]. Hope you guys are staying safe. Here was her response about the\nlion king,” which are irrelevant. And the prosecutor’s statements can only be relevant to the extent\nthat Jane was aware of them. But the defense has not established that fact, in part because the\ndefense framed its questions on cross to call for privileged information. (See, e.g., Tr. 5ll (“The\ngovernment suggested to you that perhaps you meant to say The Lion King movie through your\natorney to you; correct?” (emphasis added))).\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo838l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l2 of 24 24\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl ability to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n2 Third piece of guidance: The Court will exclude from\n3 evidence the non-prosecution agreement, both its existence and\n4 its particular terms. The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and financial interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related financial incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA. Regardless of hou the witness covered by the NPA\n23 might testify, that witness will remain protected under the NPA\n24 in the Southern District of Florida, and as I already ruled,\n25 the NPA does not provide protection in the Southern District of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l3 of 24 25\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl New York.\n\n2 Similarly, no mater hou a witness who has a\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> or financial incentive testifies, those benefits are\n4 not received under the NPA, so I don't see any theory of bias\n\n© that would be relevant that the defense has articulated with\n\n6 respect to the NPA.\n\n7 Moreover, even if there were some relevance, it would\n8 be substantially outweighed by a significant risk of 4o3\n\n9 prejudice from introducing the NPA. The jury would need to be\nlo instructed on what the non-prosecution agreement is, and would\nll need to have its terms explained. In particular, NPA, of\n\nl2 course, is controversial and complicated and has a complicated\nl3 background. There's a risk of undue delay, juror confusion,\n\nl4 and improper suggestions of sympathy or nullification made to\nl5 the jury on the basis of the NPA.\n\nl6 I will be clear, it's not clear to me the NPA could\n\nl7 never be admited, but the rationale nou provided by the\n\nl8 defense in its papers does not justify admission based on the\nl9 balancing of 4ol and 4o3 factors.\n2o Fourth guidance: The government's charging decisions\nal are likely not relevant and therefore inadmissible. The\n22 government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell by the end of the Florida\n23 investigation, and the government didn't indict Ms. Maxwell\n24 when it indicted Jeffrey Epstein originally in New York.

Nathan BOYLE\nDecember l5, 2o2l LLP\nPage 2\nMs. Maxwell would like to ask Mr. Glassman whether he made a $25 million demand to\n\nMs. Maxwell to setle the civil case against her. It should be noted that defense counsel did not\nquestion Jane about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no impeachment value to\nanything Mr. Glassman could say. It should also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms. Menninger\n(who represented Ms. Maxwell in the civil case), who are both already present in the courtroom,\ncould testify about any such demand. So there is nothing Mr. Glassman could offer on this\nsubject that would be probative and outweigh the risk of possible disclosure of confidential\ninformation inherent in calling Jane's atorney to the witness stand. Additionally, whether a\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> demand would have been made in the civil case against Ms. Maxwell seems wholly\nirrelevant as that civil case setled well over a year before Jane testified; that is, at the time Jane\ntestified in the criminal trial, she had no financial incentive to do so.\n\nWith regard to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by the\nGovernment in its opposition, and adds again that the civil case setled long before Jane's\ntestimony in the criminal trial against Ms. Maxwell — so Jane had no financial interest in the\nsubstance of her testimony.\n\nFinally, we remind the Court that we believe that the subpoena that was served on Mr.\nGlassman was invalid under Fed. R. Crim. Pro l7, and that Mr. Glassman is not currently under\nvalid subpoena.\n\nAccordingly, we respectfully request that the Defendant's motion to compel Mr.\nGlassman to testify should be denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011436.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel3 of 25\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

R. Evid. 4o8. For at least three reasons, Rule 4o8 does not apply here.\n\nFirst, the Rule only prohibits evidence of compromise when the disputed claim is the\nsame claim that was compromised. As the Second Circuit has held, “Evidence of an offer to\ncompromise, though otherwise barred by Rule 4o8, can fall outside the Rule if it is offered for\n‘another purpose,’ i.e., for a purpose other than to prove or disprove the validity of the claims\nthat the offers were meant to setle.” Trebor Sportswear Co. v. The Ltd. Stores, Inc., 865 F.2d\n5o6, 5lo (2d Cir. l989) (emphasis added); Carr v. Health Ins. Plan of Greater New York, Inc.,\nNo. 99 CIV. 37o6 (NRB), 2ool WL 563722, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 24, 2ool) (“[Rule 4o8] is not\na blanket rule of inadmissibility for any and all statements in the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> context. If evidence\nis ‘offered for another purpose’ apart from liability for (or damages resulting from) the claim\nunder <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> discussion, that evidence may be admited.” (emphasis added)); see also Equal\nEmp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Karenkim, Inc., No. 5:o8-CV-lol9 (NAM/DEP), 2oll WL\nl3352967, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. lo, 2oll) (“But when <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>-related evidence is related to a\nclaim not under consideration by a jury, courts generally permit its introduction, so long as it is\notherwise admissible, if it is relevant to a claim that is at issue.” (citing cases)).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll436\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011437.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel4 of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage l4\n\nThis is clear from the language of the Rule. “The claim” to which subsections (a)(l) and\n(a)(2) refer is the “disputed claim” referenced in subsection (a). When the “disputed claim” is\ndifferent from “the claim” compromised, the Rule’s prohibitions do not apply. Vulcan Hart\nCorp. v. N.L.R.B., 7l8 F.2d 269, 277 (8th Cir. l983) (“Rule 4o8 excludes evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\noffers only if such evidence is offered to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim under\nnegotiation.” (emphasis added)).\n\nHere, the “disputed claim” is government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell trafficked the\naccusers, facilitated their abuse, and conspired to do the same. “The claim” each accuser\ncompromised with the EVCP was “the claim” that they were entitled to money for the abuse\nperpetrated by Mr. Epstein. Because Ms. Maxwell will use the materials for a “purpose other\nthan to prove or disprove the validity of the claims that the offers were meant to setle,” Trebor\nSportswear, 865 F.2d at 5lo, Rule 4o8 does not apply.\n\nSecond, even if Rule 4o8 did apply, it would not bar admission of the evidence because\nevidence of compromise is admissible to prove a witness’s bias and prejudice, a traditional\nobject of cross-examination. Fed. R. Evid. 4o8(b). Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 68o (defendants have\na constitutional right to engage in “cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of\nbias on the part of the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors...\ncould appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” (quoting Davis,\n4l5 U.S. at 3l8)). There is no dispute that the accusers’ <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> of their claims against Mr.\nEpstein for vast sums of money is relevant to their bias and motive in both cooperating with the\ngovernment to secure prosecutorial credit, a factor in the EVCF’s protocol, and testifying against\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel5of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Prac. & Proc.

As Wright & Miller recognize,\n\nevidence of false statement during compromise negotiations would not be barred\n\nby Rule 4o8(a)(2) if offered to impeach on the theory it is a specific instance of\n\nconduct probative of a witness’ character for untruthfulness and, thus, potentially\n\nadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 6o8(b).

RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have recognized\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized that some discovery might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez].

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process.

Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case. ...

Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case... is the victims.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that ‘you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.?*’\n\n28 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafafia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n\n2o3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021411.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 337 3536o38, Page239 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 237 of 348\nand thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°’ Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact.

In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021461.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 385 3536o39, Page3l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 285 of 348\ndid not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’”*™\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.’*° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.”*°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and ‘“‘we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into... the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “‘to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. .. . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest .. ., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\nlo8 Villatafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021599.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OON-AD3 3536o39, Pagel69 of 2l7\n54\nM6SOmaxl\nl assets, and then reported $22 million in assets in support of\n2 the December 2o2o bail application.

More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties.

We specifically refused to include the provision saying that\nwe would not communicate. If] recall the conference call, we told\nhim we could not agree to a gag order using those words.\n\n2. The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court\n<span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>. Seems that they can’t take no. Let’s talk re hou to\nproceed. I’m not sure we will ever agree on a leter [to the special\nmaster about hou to select an atorney representative] at this point.\n\nNotwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkouitz a new\ndraft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s\nterms.'*7\n\nOn October 25, 2oo7, Sloman sent a leter to the person whom the USAO had selected to\nserve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties. A few days later, on October 29,\n2oo7, Epstein and his atorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s\nname was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the\naddendum for her on behalf of the USAO.\n\nVillafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which\napparently related to the defense atorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial\nselection of the private atorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:\n\nThe funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or\n\nspoken to [the private atorney] before I asked him if he would be\n\nwilling to take on this case... . But as soon as you mentioned the\n\nappearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and\n\nagreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry\n\nthat the defense’s atacks on me could harm the victims.\nSloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in\nproposing the private atorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad\nhominem atacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have\naccomplished.”\nl7 Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.\nl48 The Addendum is atached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.\n\n93\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l3l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023241.tif": "various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference\nto the victims:\n\n[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which\n\nrequires the atorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to\n\nconfer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents\n\nto keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So\n\nin essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to\n\nallegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these\n\nplea negotiations without leting us knou about it.7°°\n\nIn his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally\ninappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that\n“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Atorney to exercise\nappropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”\nDepartmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia\nresponded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgoten voices of victims in this case should not be\nclassified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”\nMenchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,\nasserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span>\nnegotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.\nMenchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion\nthat even just having a general discussion is something that must be veted with victims . . . is not\neven ... in the same universe as to hou I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the\nvery day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations without consulting\nher, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the\npossibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state\nresolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7°”\n285 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”\nVillafaia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the\nvictim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the\nvictims” but did not likely contain information as to “hou they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that\nMenchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that\nthe allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line\nin terms of what the law is and the policies are.”\n286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were\nfiled against a defendant.\n287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended\nonly to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.\n2o3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2324l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023249.tif": "and thanking Acosta for agreeing on October l2, 2oo7, not to “contact any of the identified\nindividuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this\nmater.”°°7 Shortly thereafter, Sloman drafted a response to Lefkouitz’s leter, which Acosta\nrevised to clarify the “inaccurate” representations made by Lefkouitz, in particular noting that\nAcosta did not agree to a “gag order” with regard to victim contact. The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.3°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed financial <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’””>”\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023297.tif": "did not find evidence shouing that the subjects intended to silence victims or to prevent them from\nhaving input into the USAO’s intent to resolve the federal investigation.\n\nAlthough the contemporaneous records provide some information about victim notification\ndecisions made after the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, the records contain litle about\nthe subjects’ views regarding consultation with victims before the NPA was signed. In a\nSeptember 6, 2oo7 email primarily addressing other topics, as the plea negotiations were beginning\nin earnest and almost three weeks before the NPA was signed, Villafafia raised the topic of victim\nconsultation with Sloman: “The agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their\napproval, which as [CEOS Chief Oosterban] politely reminded me, is required under the law. . . .\n[A]nd the [PBPD] Chief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.’4%\nSloman forwarded the email to Acosta with a note stating, “fyi.” Villafafia recalled that after she\nsent the email, Sloman told her by telephone, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.”*°° Villafafia also told\nOPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve been advised that . . . pre-\ncharge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Villafafia also recalled a discussion with\nAcosta, Menchel, and Sloman, during which she stated that she would need to get victims’ input\non the terms being proposed to the defense, and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.\nYou can’t disclose them.’4°°\n\nNone of the other subjects recalled a specific discussion before the NPA was signed about\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations. Menchel told OPR he believed the USAO was not required to\nconsult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of <span class=\"highlight\">setlement</span> negotiations;\nmoreover, he left the USAO before the terms of the NPA were fully developed.\n\nSloman told OPR that he “did not think that we had to consult with victims prior to entering\ninto the NPA” and “we did not have to seek approval from victims to resolve a case.” Sloman\nbelieved the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the cases that we\nhandled, filed cases.” Sloman recalled that because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution\nof the mater, he did not “think that that was a concern of ours at the time to consult with [the\nvictims] prior to entering into .. . the NPA.”\n\nLourie told OPR that he did not recall any discussions about informing the victims about\nthe terms of the NPA or any instructions to Villafafia that she not discuss the NPA with the victims.\nHe stated that everything the USAO did was “to try and get the best result as possible for the\nvictims. . . . [O]nce you step back and look at the whole forest . .., you will see that... . [I]f you\nlook at each tree and say, well, you didn’t do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim\nthis and that, you’re missing the big picture.”\n\n4o4 As noted, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not require consultation with victims\nbecause no criminal charges had been filed. In addition, Villafafia’s reference to victim “approval” was inaccurate\nbecause the CVRA, even when applicable, requires only “consultation” with victims about prosecutorial decisions.\n\n4o5 Villafafia did not recall Sloman explaining the reason for the decision.\n\n4o6 Villafafia also told OPR that she recalled Menchel raising a concern that “telling them about the negotiations\ncould cause victims to exaggerate their stories because of their desire to obtain damages from Epstein.” Villafafia was\nuncertain of the date of the conversation, but Menchel’s presence requires it to have occurred before August 3, 2oo7.\n\n259\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023654.jpg": "Funds found in an institution that cannot be atributed to a specific inmate are delivered to the\nAccounting Section and deposited in accordance with the Program Statement Imprest Funds,\nCollections, and Deposits.\n8.7 MANAGEMENT OF DECEASED INMATES’ FUNDS\nIf an inmate dies with funds remaining in his/her Inmate Deposit account, that money should be\ndistributed in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution in the relevant state. If the\ninmate dies with monies due from the United States, payment is not authorized except to a legal\nrepresentative of the estate or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution of the state of\ndomicile (most recent legal residence).\na.

Unclaimed Funds of Deceased Inmates. Procedures for processing “whereabouts\n| unknoun” inmates are folloued when disposing unclaimed funds of deceased inmates with no\nrelatives or claimants for the funds.\n8.8 ENCUMBRANCE OF INMATE FUNDS\nEncumbrance of inmate funds for various reasons is essential. Careful consideration is given\nbefore any action; encumbrances are not made indiscriminately. An encumbrance may be made\nfor various reasons (e.g. to ensure inmates do not seriously deplete their funds before release,\ndisciplinary measures, inmate’s request, claims). Encumbrances are at the Warden’s discretion or\nthe result of a disciplinary hearing sanction or notification of a pending Federal court order. This\nauthority is not delegated belou the Associate Warden.
