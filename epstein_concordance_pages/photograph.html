Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll).

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9. Indeed: “What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a\ncase in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the\ndefendant’s appearance?” Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l432, at *l2 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000342.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l4 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l4\nSecond, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section l59l applied to both\nsuppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d\nlo66, lo69 (8th Cir. 2ol3) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who atempted to pay for oral\nsex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain\nand unambiguous provisions of l8 U.S.C. § l59l apply to both suppliers and consumers of\ncommercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the\ndefendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll Civ. 8573, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2), relied\nheavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South\nDakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll Cr. 4ool6, 2ol2 WL l37o4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2), and\nUnited States v. Jungers, ll Cr. 4ool8, 2oll WL 6o46495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2oll), both of which\nwere explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66. In the seven\nyears since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.\nAdditionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or\ncustomers. See United States v. O’Connor, 65o F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2oll) (upholding convictions\nunder Section l59l of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983\n(8th Cir. 2ol5) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section l59l would be void for vagueness\nif applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. o9 Cr. o36, 2oo9 WL 47989oo (W.D.\nMo. Dec. 7, 2oo9) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, l8 U.S.C. § l59l clearly applies to those\nwho atempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing\nUnited States v. Roberts, l74 F. App’s 475 (llth Cir. 2oo6) (in which defendant was convicted\nunder sections l59l(a) and l594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.\nPretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual\nand concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,\ndemonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd\nphotographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\nconviction. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely\nthe presumptions and the § 3l42(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be\ndetained.”’).\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v.

It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

This individual was also named and featured\nprominently in the Herald series.\nII. Police Report\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach\npolice report, which was annexed to the Government’s July l2, 2ol9 detention memorandum. At\nthe Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report\npreviously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the\npolice report is atached as Exhibit A.\n\nIll. Foreign Passport\n\nDuring the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently\nlearned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the\n“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence during the execution of a\nsearch warrant on or about July 6, 2ol9. The Foreign Passport has a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> that appears to\ndepict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto\nas Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States\npassport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign\nPassport. A <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the\nCourt may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits\nB and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the\nongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under\nseal.\n\nThe Government is atempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,\nincluding hou it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the\ndefendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to\nthe inference the defendant knous hou to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,\nforeign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”\n> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has\nbeen in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To\ndate, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen\nor permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming\nevidence of risk of flight.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000483.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page l2 of 33 |\n|\nMr. Epstein’s future behavior will be consistent with past behavior, including the trove of “lewd |\nphotographs of young-looking women or girls,” which were recently uncovered during the July |\n6-7, 2ol9, search of Mr. Epstein’s East 7lst Street mansion.

The LaFontaine Court explained that “while the\ninformality of bail hearings serves the demands of speed, the ... district\njudge must also ensure the reliability of the evidence, ‘by selectively\ninsisting upon the production of the underlying evidence of evidentiary\nsources where their accuracy is in question.” Id. at l3l (quoting Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll47). And in Martir, this Court recognized the “high stakes”\ninvolved in a detention hearing and explained that the pouer afforded to\nthe louer courts “should always be exercised ‘with the recognition that a\npretrial detention hearing may restrict for a significant time the liberty\nof a presumably innocent person.” 782 F.2d at ll45 Gnternal citations\nomited).

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court grant the\nGovernment permission to delay disclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents\nregarding victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review.

Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case.

(Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny.’\n\nSecond, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule l6\nbecause the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shoun\ngood cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\n' We note that yesterday we sent the government a leter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements\n\nor writen communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.\n\nEpstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”\nDOJ-OGR-ooool795\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001796.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 2 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 3\nB. Discussion\nl. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001801.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page l of 4\n.)

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997.

This is particularly so when weighed against the\nrisks of early production to the Government’s ongoing investigation.\n\nBy contrast, the Government has met its burden under Rule l6(d)(l) by explaining why\nthe requested delay is necessary and hou the Government would be prejudiced by the immediate\nproduction of the Materials. In particular, the proposed delay will allou the Government to\ncontinue its investigation into conduct outside the period charged in the Indictment without\nrevealing to the defendant the identities of the witnesses in that investigation. The premature\nrevelation of this information would give the defendant the opportunity to interfere with the\nGovernment’s investigation before it is complete. Such information could allou her to contact\nand intimidate witnesses, destroy evidence relevant to the investigation, or alert other targets of\nthe investigation. Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when\nit has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming\nforward to assist in the Government’s investigation. Allouing the delayed production of these\nmaterials would permit the Government to complete its investigation without interference while\nstill giving the defense everything it is asking for well in advance of trial.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\nGovernment’s request to delay disclosure of these Materials.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the\nentire theory of prosecution.\n\nThe Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-\nProsecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2oo7.\nThis is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.\n\nAccording to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in\n2ol6 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to\nconvince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not\nultimately succeed.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court grant the\nGovernment permission to delay disclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents\nregarding victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature disclosure of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay disclosure of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief. The court\n\nmay permit a party to shou good cause by a writen statement that\n\nthe court will inspect ex parte.\nA finding of good cause “‘must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm,\nnot on conclusory statements.’” United States v.

Count Two of the Indictment charges Maxwell with enticing a minor to travel to engage in\nillegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2. Count Three of the Indictment charges\nMaxwell with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to participate in illegal sex\nacts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §37l. Count Four of the Indictment charges Maxwell with\ntransporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2. Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed disclosure of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate disclosure of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate disclosure to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 5o6, 53l-32 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (risk of interference with ongoing\ninvestigation sufficient good cause for entry of Rule l6 protective order). Immediate disclosure\nof these materials would have the effect of prematurely revealing to the defendant the identities of\ncertain Epstein victims who are not referenced in the Indictment but who have spoken with the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 75 Filed ll/24/2o Page l of 2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age.

The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases.

Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page7of8\nThe Hon.

Ms. Maxwell should not be required to expend considerable time\nand resources obtaining relevant exculpatory evidence that could have been seized or\nsubpoenaed by the government. Premature disclosure of the evidence would impinge on Ms.\nMaxwell’s rights to effective assistance of counsel and reveal defense strategy and work\nproduct.\n\nRule l6, not Rule l7, governs the timing of any reciprocal discovery request, and it\nprovides that if a defendant requests disclosure from the government under Rule l6(a)(l)(E),\nthen upon compliance with a similar request by the government, the defendant is required to\npermit the government to inspect and copy or <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> documents and tangible objects\nwhich are within the possession, custody or control of the defendant and which the defendant\nintends to introduce at trial.

Any Protective Order Regarding the Rule l7 Material Should Be Separate\nfrom the Protective Order Entered at the Insistence of the Government and Over Ms.\nMaxwell’s Objection\n\nThe government has repeatedly objected to any modification of the Protective Order\nentered in this case.?

Much of the information\n(emma vor hate, Aaeesmel, seven te to negotiate reciprocal protective order protections in\nJuly 2o2o, but the government steadfastly then insisted that a separate negotiation would\noccur at an undefined later time to any materials to be produced by defense counsel.

As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, the Government has already\nincluded Rule l6 discovery relating to the S2 Indictment in its prior productions to the defense,\nand the Government has provided the defense with a list of pages within those discovery\nproductions that are particularly pertinent to the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment.”\nContrary to the defense’s suggestion in its most recent leter, the largest discovery production in\nthis case came from electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein. That production, dated\nNovember l8, 2o2o, included approximately l.2 million documents (totaling approximately 2.2\nmillion pages), all of which are text searchable and were produced in a format conducive to loading\nthat production into a document review platform.? Moreover, the defense’s suggestion that it will\nneed to re-review every single page of discovery produced to date is, at best, hyperbolic. The\ndefense has already reviewed the discovery and presumably knous which portions relate in\n> To the extent the defense complains of recent difficulties reviewing certain Highly Confidential\nimages or other items that must be reviewed in the presence of federal agents, it bears noting that\nthe Government repeatedly informed defense counsel beginning in the fall of 2o2o that those\nmaterials would be made available for review upon request. The defense did not request to review\nthose materials until March 2o2l, after which the Government coordinated with defense counsel,\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to arrange for multiple days in April\n2o2l during which all of the materials were made available for review. The Government is of\ncourse willing to make similar arrangements should defense counsel believe additional review of\nthose materials is necessary.\n3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government with a list of documents that the\ndefendant has been unable to review from the prior discovery productions. As it has done in the\npast when such issues have been raised, the Government will work with its staff and staff at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) to address these issues as expeditiously as possible. The\nGovernment notes, houever, that had defense counsel raised these specific issues earlier, the\nGovernment could have addressed them much sooner.\nSimilarly, the defense only raised concerns about metadata on certain photographs this month,\neven though those photographs were produced to the defense in November 2o2o. The Government\nis working with its staff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into and, where possible,\naddress the defense’s concerns as quickly as possible.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003982.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagellofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Once again, the government has scrupulously avoided actually obtaining the\nevidence, and Ms. Maxwell seeks to use Rule l7 as it is intended, to examine the boots in\nadvance of trial. The examination will identify the make and provenance of the boots, something\nwhich would be difficult to do during any trial without significant delay.\n\nSimilarly, the photographs listed in Request ll are physical evidence that exists -- copies\nwere produced by BSF in civil litigation, the photographs are admitedly relevant, and admissible\nas evidence. Again, the government has not obtained the originals. Accordingly, no one knous\nthe dates of creation or any other specifics related to these items of evidence.

BSF\nargues that the request for this information is premature because according to BSF it is merely\n“impeachment” evidence and that the information should be classified as “witness statements”\nnot reachable by a Rule l7 (c) subpoena.\n\nBSF is wrong on both counts. First, the documents do not meet the definition of “witness\nstatements.” These are submissions to a fund requesting large sums of money and the\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3982\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page6ofl3\nThe Hon.

The conspiracy\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance. The need to research\nMs. Maxwell’s whereabouts during a full eleven year period, not to mention comb the millions\nof pages of discovery including travel records, phone records, bank records, photographs, diaries,\nmessage pads, credit card records, and countless other records for the eleven-year versus four\nyear period, will take hundreds, if not thousands, of atorney and staff hours.\n\nC. The new, and old, discovery require review (and re-review) and analysis.\n\nThe government, on April l3, 2o2l, produced more than 2o,ooo pages of “new”\ndiscovery. Although the government represented that this production is related to “non-testifying\nwitnesses,” it is more accurately described as exculpatory Brady material. Notably, the\ngovernment has possessed most of this information for years (in some cases, more than a decade)\nand has resisted disclosure until after the filing of the second superseding indictment and on the\neve of trial.2, Many of the reports recently produced stem from the years 2oo6-2oo8.\n\n? Consistent with the updated Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(f) and the Due Process Protections Act, Pub. L.\nNo ll6-l82, l34 Stat. 894 (Oct. 2l, 2o2o), this Court on November 5, 2o2o, ordered that “The\nGovernment shall disclose [Brady] information to the defense promptly after its existence\nbecomes knoun to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information\nin the preparation of its case.

The metadata\nassociated with thousands of these photographs that were produced to counsel (but missing from\nMs. Maxwell’s production) were stripped and included in Excel spreadsheets. One of the Excel\nspreadsheets is not functioning, and the government has been asked to provide a replacement.\nThe two functioning Excel spreadsheets contain the file names, not the Bates-stamps, of the\nassociated photographs, so there is no way to match the photographs with its metadata. The\nExcel spreadsheets contains both photographs that were produced to counsel and also\nphotographs that were not produced, without identifying which is which. Moreover, the\ngovernment did not indicate on the file names or the spreadsheets which photographs it\nconsidered “Highly Confidential” under the case’s protective order.\n\nBeginning on April l3, 2o2l, Ms. Maxwell and one or more of her lawyers undertook an\nevidence review in the courthouse in conjunction with the prosecution and FBI. Under the terms\nof the protective order, defense counsel are not alloued to possess “highly confidential material.”\nThe 4 days set aside to review this material was insufficient. The government placed\napproximately 5,ooo images it contends are Highly Confidential on two hard drives. When\ndefense counsel first atempted to view the images, the one laptop designated for the task by the\ngovernment was insufficient either because of the laptop or the software on the laptop. On\nThursday, April l5, a functioning computer was provided to defense counsel. A review of the\nimages revealed no good reason why the hard drives, which do not appear to contain prohibited\nvisual depictions restricted byl8 U.S. § 2256, cannot be copied and provided to defense counsel.\nThe sheer number of images make it impossible for any effective review to take place in a\ngovernment office with various proctors.

And, again, the images\ncontain metadata that defense counsel must forensically analyze. Because defense counsel do not\neven have all of the images, this investigation cannot be accomplished in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial.\n\nF. The new charges and discovery require the assistance of defense experts\n\nIn addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of\npotential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized\nknouledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is nou potentially relevant due to the\nexpanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential\nhard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual\nfile creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government\nhas not identified any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic\nexaminers may be necessary to analyze the exhibits.\n\nMs. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 2o,ooo pages of “new” material to\nprovide that information to potential defense experts for consideration.

This request is improper under Rule l7 in three respects.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004101.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page8of9\nPage 8\nthus, that the Court need not resolve Request lo at this time, as the Court will likely be able to\ndeny it as moot in the near term.\nC. Request ll\n\nRequest ll appears to seek a series of photographs. The Government’s understanding is\nthat the defendant already has copies of those photographs. (See 4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No.\n244 at ll (“[C]lopies were produced by BSF in civil litigation.”)). It also appears that the\nGovernment also produced copies of some of these photographs in Rule l6 discovery. In any\nevent, and again although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government requested\nthat BSF provide it with copies of the complete set of requested photographs, which it has obtained\nand produced to the defendant.\n\nRemaining at issue, then, are only the original versions of the photographs. The\nGovernment understands from BSF that the photographs were all taken on film and are not digital\nphotographs. Accordingly, the originals are physical photographs, not digital files. The defense\nsubpoena for these original photographs should be denied, at least unless and until the defendant\nprovides further justification for the need for and entitlement to the originals. Because the\ndefendant already has copies of the photographs, the defendant must explain hou her request for\nthe originals can satisfy the Nixon test without being “otherwise procurable.” 4l8 U.S. at 699.\n\nThe defendant suggests that she needs the originals to identify the “dates of creation or any\nother specifics.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at ll). It is entirely unclear what “other\nspecifics” refers to, but as noted above, the Government understands that these photographs were\ntaken on film, such that the originals would generally not contain metadata regarding the date or\nother information regarding when they were taken.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\noe Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004687.jpg": "— Case l 2o-croo33o-PAE Document 293-3 Filed o5/25/2l Page 25 of 34_——__--—_\nI\n. 27\n2 |teke naked photographs of i =\n3 |Mr.z Epslein\"'s regidence in and around bre house :\n4 and pool area st the rcequest of Mr. Epstein. ¢\nke G And approximately hou etd or hou oid |\nB & f  Y infermed us that she\n© jwas l6 years ald when ee: :- the\nlo {photographs of hes naked.\nl7 O Woat did er say about\nl2 jwhether Jeffrey Epstein knew her true age?\n. l3 5 [ER «>: etorcca by\n., l4 Pee Say if asked her age that she\nl & was -- the should respond that she was l7, When )\nl6 |they went -- and went to Mr. Epstein's residence |\nl7 |and were upstairs performing massages, Mr. Epstein |\nl3 She responded four --; And then he |\n2o sad, so you're l47 And Mr. Epatein informed [| |\n2l ae >=: they would just keep that |\n22 joetween them. |\n23 ia) So in ether words, he knew that she was\n24 l4 when she started seeing him?\n25 & Yes.

To assist the defense in reviewing this discovery, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has identified particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and contemporary photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year. Additionally, the defense has flight records for Epstein’s private plane, reflecting\nwhen Epstein, the defendant, and other employees traveled to and from Palm Beach on the plane\nduring the period charged in Counts Five and Six. In other words, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about Minor Victim-4 to permit her to prepare for\ntrial.\n\nSimilar to the other three minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment, any remaining\ndetail regarding the specifics of abuse and particular interactions will come from witness\ntestimony.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn April 27, 2o2l, the Court denied Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s request for\nauthorization to serve a subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Dkt. No. 252. The Court\nrequested the Government’s views as to three of those requests: Request 9, which sought\nproduction of Minor Victim-2’s entire diary from her teenage years; Request lo, which targeted\na pair of boots that Minor Victim-2 allegedly received as a gift from Jeffrey Epstein and\nMaxwell; and Request ll, which sought original versions of certain photographs. /d. The\nGovernment submited its views on May 4, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 269. It supplemented its leter on\nMay 6, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 27l. The Defendant filed a response on May l2, 2o2l. Having\nconsidered the parties’ views, the Defendant’s request is denied in full.\n\nAs noted, Request 9 seeks the original copy of a journal from an alleged victim from\nwhen she was a teenager. Maxwell received copies of some of the pages in the journal from the\nGovernment pursuant to Rule l6, but the Government represents that it does not have access to\nthe entire journal. In those pages, Minor Victim-2 describes a trip to New York in which she\nspent time with Epstein and, among other things, visited his residence. Minor Victim-2 also\ndescribes her impression of Epstein at the time. There is no indication that Maxwell is\nmentioned there or anywhere else in the journal.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 298 Filed o6/o4/2l Page4of6\nmeritless. Lastly, Maxwell’s theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal\nwas writen and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication\ntestimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual\nreason to doubt the journal’s authenticity. In her May l2, 2o2l leter, Maxwell claims that two\ncopies of one of the pages are “obviously, and noticeably, different.” The difference, which is\nnot explained in the leter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing\nand handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a\n<span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of\nthe same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here\nagain Maxwell’s arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For\nall of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule l7(c) subpoena is not the proper\nvehicle for Request 9.\n\nRequest lo seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein\nallegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that\nBSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the\nGovernment will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial.\nMaxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots’ production to the defense.\nThe argument is meritless. Rule l7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third\nparties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial.”\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo.

Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their\nauthenticity. In its May 6 leter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset\nof the photographs are in the FBI’s possession, and the Government will make those photographs\navailable to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that\nthe request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to\ncomply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon\nrequest, the defense may make an application to the Court.\n\nAs to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has\nfailed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already\nhas photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers\nthat it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are\ngenuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell\ndoes not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because\nimpeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule l7(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s\nrelevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish\nrelevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s\ntestimony or whether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nI.

For starters, the Government conducted an over-the-\ntop press conference upon Ms. Maxwell’s arrest — with blouups, photographs,\nsoundbites, inflammatory language, and strategic pauses to get the most impactful\nphoto opportunity, all designed to stir up the press, inflame the passions of the public,\nand prejudice the potential jury against Ms. Maxwell. And it worked. The Government’s\npress conference was one of, if not the most, covered Government’s press conferences in\nU.S. history.

As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.\n\nThe request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not\nmade the required shouing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only\nplausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary\nfor purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 4-5. The need to\nimpeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of\ntrial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment\nmaterial does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.\nl5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May l7, 2ol8)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645\n(2d Cir. 2o2l) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these\nmaterials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why\nthese materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,\nthe request is improper for purposes of Rule l7(c). In any event, there is litle risk that review of\nthese materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their\nlimited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. l6-CR-467 (ALC), 2ol7 WL 48383ll, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2ol7). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to\nprocure them at that time.\n\nMaxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-l’s journal also fails the Nixon\ntest. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2o2l opinion, the original and complete journal is not the\nproper subject of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o32\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page4oflo\nwarrant the issuance of a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at l-2.\nMaxwell’s other theories of relevance similarly fail; as the Court previously observed, there is no\nmerit to Maxwell’s contention that the contents of the journal, other than the pages to which she\nalready has access, are exculpatory. See id. And more generally, the request for production of\nthe entire original journal is speculative and overbroad, amounting to litle more than a “fishing\nexpedition,” which is not the proper use of Rule l7(c). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7o.\n\nThe request for the original pair of black boots is moot. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l\nOrder, at 4-5. The Government has indicated that it has requested that BSF produce the boots to\nthe FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI’s possession, the Government will promptly\nmake them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. Rule l7(c) is not the proper\nmechanism for discovery from third parties where the sought-after item is “otherwise procurable\nreasonably in advance of trial.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 698-7oo. That is the case here: The\nGovernment has represented that the defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. See\nDkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5.\n\nThe request for original copies of certain photographs similarly fails. As the Court\npreviously noted, the defense has access to photocopies of those photographs; the request is\ntherefore for the originals. The Government has indicated that a subset of those photographs are\nin the FBI’s possession and that it will make them available to the defense for inspection; the\nrequest is moot as to those photographs. See Dkt. No. 298, June 2, 2o2l Order, at 4-5. And as\nto the remaining photographs, the request is again denied on the basis that the defense has failed\nto establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already has\nphotocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. The only discernible theory of\nrelevance as to the original versions of these photographs is impeachment. Once again, it is\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page5oflo\nimproper to issue a Rule l7(c) subpoena where the sole relevance of the requested materials is\nimpeachment. There is no plausible claim that inspection of the original photographs is\nwarranted, and to the extent that Maxwell seeks the photographs in order to disprove their\nauthenticity (and challenge any potential testimony that might be advanced at trial), the request is\nentirely speculative. Even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish relevance, the\nargument fails because Maxwell does not yet knou the scope of the victim’s testimony or\nwhether it will implicate the photographs.\n\nFinally, the request for materials related to the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund is\ndenied for substantially the same reasons the Court articulated in its April 27, 2o2l Opinion. See\nDkt. No. 252, April 27, 2o2l Op., at 6-8. Here, too, Maxwell has failed to establish the\nmaterials’ relevance. The briefing makes clear that Maxwell seeks these documents for mere\nimpeachment purposes, which again does not warrant issuance or enforcement of a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena. Furthermore, to the extent that Maxwell hinges her theory of relevance on the\npossibility that these documents may contain some exculpatory evidence, the request is entirely\nspeculative. The “mere hope” that documents might produce some degree of exculpatory\nevidence is also insufficient. See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-579 (SWK), l984 WL 845,\nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, l984). Maxwell has proffered no plausible basis why these materials\nmight be exculpatory beyond her theory that they will help her undermine the potential witness’s\ncredibility.\n\nIn sum, for the reasons stated by the Court in its April 27, 2o2l and June 2, 2o2l orders,\nthe request for authorization of a Rule l7(c) subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-l is DENIED.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6oflo\n\nB. Subpoena Recipient-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests. The first seeks\nany contingent fee and engagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-2 and any\natorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch\nDNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and\ntelephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the\nsame reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of relevance is impeachment, which\nplaces them outside the proper scope of Rule l7(c).\n\nThe second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any\ninformation derived from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At\nmost, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-\n2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope\nof Rule l7(c).\n\nThe third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena Recipient-2\nshoued or produced to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails for two reasons. The first is relevance; as\nabove, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare\nto rebut any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial (or any evidence\nintroduced through Subpoena Recipient-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena\nRecipient-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page9oflo\nno other theory of relevance (including that the materials are exculpatory or otherwise relate to\nthe criminal charges at issue), and on this independent basis, the requests fail.\n\nRequest 8 seeks “all” photographs, diaries, journals, or other documentary evidence\nobtained from “any” person who has accused Maxwell. The request, another fishing expedition,\nis plainly unjustified under the Nixon test. The first problem relates to specificity. As above, the\nwords “all” and “any” do not “evince specificity.” United States v. Tagliaferro, No. l9-CR-472\n(PAC), 2o2l WL 98ooo4, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l6, 2o2l). Here, Maxwell does not atempt to\nnarrou the request and instead seeks a// materials obtained from any person who has accused\nMaxwell—at any point, without any limitations. Nixon requires greater specificity. See Nixon,\n4l8 U.S. at 698-7o. In addition, the requests fail because Maxwell has not established the\nrelevance of all of those materials. Under Rule l7(c), the moving party must shou that all of the\nrequested material is relevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. l5-CR-55l (AJN), 2ol6 WL\n8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l2, 2ol6). Clearly, the request seeks materials related to people\nwho are not referenced in the Indictment. Maxwell has not made any kind of shouing why those\nmaterials are relevant to the criminal charges she faces in this case. Thus, the request is\nimproper.\n\nRequest 9 seeks the same evidence as the third request in the proposed subpoena to\nSubpoena Recipient-2. For the reasons discussed above, that request fails.\n\nFinally, Request lo seeks EVCP materials. As discussed above, the only plausible theory\nof relevance for those materials is impeachment, and as such Maxwell has not established the\nrelevance of those materials for purposes of the Nixon analysis.\n\nIn sum, none of the requests contained in these two subpoenas satisfy the Nixon factors.\nAs a result, the requests are DENIED in full.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page3oflo\n\nAs previously detailed, Annie Farmer is believed to be the alleged victim referred to in\nthe superseding indictment as “Minor Victim 2.” She is represented by BSF. See, e.g., Annie\nFarmer v. Indyke, et al., No. l9 Civ. lo475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for\nproduction of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, black\nboots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of\nthe photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknoun whether the items\nare currently in the possession of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer. Ms. Maxwell proposes to serve a\nsubpoena, atached as Exhibit l, on Ms. Annie Farmer for the physical items; counsel also\nproposes that service be effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.' Inspection\nof each of these items in advance of trial is necessary for the reasons set forth in the Ms.\nMaxwell’s First Motion.\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Ms. Annie Farmer in the event that BSF\nclaims the physical items are not in their custody or control, but rather belong to (and are in the\npossession of) their client. The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information\nbeyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,\nMaria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria\nFarmer v. Indyke et al., l9 Civ. lo474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed\nsubpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.\n\nDefense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,\nhouever, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either\n\n' Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3) requires notice to an alleged victim where “personal or\nconfidential information about a victim” is being sought.

See\nFirst Motion at ll, l5-l6. Maria Farmer is the individual who purportedly introduced her\nyounger sister to Jeffrey Epstein. In her civil lawsuit and in numerous public statements, Ms.\nMaria Farmer has asserted that she has certain physical items that substantiate her allegations\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. She described in various publications certain\n“envelopes” that she “still has” with the touch DNA and fingerprints of Jeffrey Epstein and\nGhislaine Maxwell.” Ms. Maxwell seeks to examine those envelopes and to test them in advance\nof trial to disprove Maria Farmer’s claims.\n\nMaria Farmer also reportedly met with atorneys Brad Edwards and Stanley Potinger at\nher home in Paducah, KY in or about June 2ol6. To counsel’s knouledge, those atorneys have\nnever represented Maria Farmer. Brad Edwards describes in his self-published memoir,\nRelentless Pursuit, that Maria Farmer during that meeting shoued him substantial physical\nevidence corroborating her claims against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including\nphotographs, diaries, telephone books, Rolodexes and mementos collected from her “time with\nEpstein and Maxwell.” See Ex. 2(A). Ms. Maxwell also seeks to examine these items of\nphysical evidence in advance of trial so that her experts and investigation team may rebut any\nsuch evidence and effectively confront this accuser. The requests for her atorneys’ fee\nagreements and her EVCP Materials are identical to those in the BSF subpoena, but are being\nrequested directly from her in the event her atorneys claim they do not have constructive\npossession or control over those items.\n\n? In a podcast with journalist Whitney Webb which aired on May 26, 2o2o, Maria Farmer\nclaimed to possess “envelopes” that “still have the touch DNA and fingerprints on them” of\n“Jeffrey and Ghislaine” and that she offered them to the FBI but the FBI said “we don’t need it.”\nhtps://soundcloud.com/user-4l4392239/27l-epstein-victim-maria-farmer-speaks-part-2-the-last-\namerican-vagabond-whitney-webb\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page5oflo\n\nNixon Factors:\n\nEach of the items specified in the Annie and Maria Farmer proposed subpoenas is\nrelevant, specific and admissible. These two alleged victims have publicly identified the\nmaterials and publicly proclaimed they corroborate and support their allegations. There are no\nevidentiary impediments to admissibility. The documents, photographs, footwear, envelope and\nmementos presumably can be authenticated by Annie or Maria Farmer at trial.

Brad Edwards and Stan Potinger\n\nItems l-5: Communications Concerning Meetings with the U.S. Atorney’s Office\n\nAs detailed in the First Motion, Brad Edwards and Stan Potinger’ represented Virginia\nGiuffre (along with BSF) beginning in or about 2ol5. It was in connection with that\nrepresentation that both atorneys apparently met with AUSA Amanda Kramer on or about\nFebruary 29, 2ol6 in order to press a criminal prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. See First\nMotion at 4-9. Based on the discovery recently produced, Mr. Potinger is knoun to have\nemailed with Ms. Kramer in or about May 2ol6. According to a “source,” the NY Daily News\nreported that “Boies and Potinger re-approached Kramer [after Ms. Maxwell’s July 2ol6\ndeposition] and asked if the Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury.”\nAUSA Kramer has claimed that she does not “remember” a second meeting. Mr. Edwards wrote\nabout his first meeting with the U.S. Atorney’s Office in his memoir, Relentless Pursuit.\n\n3 In 2ol5-l7, Mr. Potinger and Mr. Edwards worked at different law firms. At some\nunknoun later time, they joined efforts and formed their current firm, Edwards Potinger. It is\nunclear who the current custodian of their records might be, so Ms. Maxwell proposes serving\nsubpoenas on both of them individually.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005050.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336 Filed o9/o7/2l Page8oflo\ntopic, communications about Ms. Maxwell, and ms’ The\ncommunications are relevant, authentic, and an appropriate evidentiary foundation can be\nestablished under many rules of evidence including F.R.E. 8o3(6).

Ms. Maxwell was the target of these lawyers who sought to profit\nby suing her and Epstein. Having Ms. Maxwell indicted during the pendency of the defamation\naction would have been very helpful to their cause.

The lawyers, and their clients, have traded\ninformation for years which has either, intentionally or unintentionally, alloued the witnesses to\nconform their testimony.

Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl33 (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nA Government arranged photo array is unduly suggestive when a procedure “give[s] rise\nto a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Simmons v. United States at 384\n(l968); see also United States v. Hemmings, 482 F. App'x 64o, 646 (2d Cir. 2ol2). In the context\nof a photo array, familiar examples of a suggestive presentation include the “use of a very small\nnumber of photographs,” “the use of suggestive comments,” or the display of the accused’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> in a way that “so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an\nidentifying witness that that person was more likely to be the culprit.” United States v.\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 377 (2d Cir. l992).\n\nDe | 2° photo looks like a mug shot, is\ndifferent than the others, and the manner in which it was presented was unduly suggestive.\n\nWhere, as here, pretrial procedures have been unduly suggestive, the court must\ndetermine whether an in-court identification will be the product of the suggestive procedures or\nwhether instead it is independently reliable. The factors to be considered include “the\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness! degree of\natention, the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty\ndemonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and\nthe confrontation.” Neil v.

It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial.

Ms. Maxwell did not create\nthe document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did.\n\nII. The Items are Not Relevant\n\nRule 4ol defines relevant evidence as that which “has any tendency to make a fact more\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence,” so long as “the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” Fed.

Salim, l89 F. Supp.\n2d 93, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nHere, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice\nto Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the relationship\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary foundation, is\nhearsay, and is irrelevant because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment. (Def.\nMot. l3 at 2-3). Government Exhibit 6o6 is a manual governing the operations of the Palm Beach\nhouse. A witness at trial is expected to authenticate this document and explain that it was the\nversion in effect at the house in 2oo5.

Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22,\nl33 (2d Cir. 2ool).\n\nA Government arranged photo array is unduly suggestive when a procedure “give[s] rise\nto a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.” Simmons v. United States at 384\n(l968); see also United States v. Hemmings, 482 F. App'x 64o, 646 (2d Cir. 2ol2). In the context\nof a photo array, familiar examples of a suggestive presentation include the “use of a very small\nnumber of photographs,” “the use of suggestive comments,” or the display of the accused’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> in a way that “so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an\nidentifying witness that that person was more likely to be the culprit.” United States v.\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 377 (2d Cir. l992).\n\nDe | 2° photo looks like a mug shot, is\ndifferent than the others, and the manner in which it was presented was unduly suggestive.\n\nWhere, as here, pretrial procedures have been unduly suggestive, the court must\ndetermine whether an in-court identification will be the product of the suggestive procedures or\nwhether instead it is independently reliable. The factors to be considered include “the\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness! degree of\natention, the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty\ndemonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and\nthe confrontation.” Neil v.

It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others,\nhouever, such as the ones described belou, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no\nprobative value, and are extremely prejudicial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell objects to the\nfollouing exhibits pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 4ol, 4o3 and 4o4(b):\n\nI.

In addition to problems related to the evidentiary foundation of these items,\nthey are not relevant to any issue in this case. The unopened boxes were purportedly seized in\n2oo5, after the end of any conspiracy alleged here. No witness will identify these items as having\nbeen in Ms. Maxwell’s possession or used in connection with any crime alleged in the\nindictment.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6697\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006698.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page5of8\n\nGovernment Exhibit 3l3 purports to be a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of Ms. Maxwell, purportedly seized\nfrom a DVD disk in a binder found on a shelf in Jeffrey Epstein’s house when it was searched in\n2ol9.

There is no evidentiary\nfoundation for this document, it is hearsay, and the one date on the document, “2/l4/2oo5,”\nsuggests that it was created after the events alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell did not create\nthe document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did.\n\nII. The Items are Not Relevant\n\nRule 4ol defines relevant evidence as that which “has any tendency to make a fact more\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence,” so long as “the fact is of consequence in\ndetermining the action.” Fed. R. Evid. 4ol; see also Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl78 (l997).\n\nThere is no evidence that any accuser in this case saw, was aware of, or impacted by any\nof the above listed items. [nn\nHE Regardless, the photographs are not probative of any material fact in this case.\nSimilarly, the apparent seizure of the “Twin Torpedos” in 2oo5 is not probative of anything.\n\nPhotographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2ol9 prove no material fact in this\ncase not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed belou.\n\nFinally, the unauthenticated 2oo5 “Household Manual” is outside the time frame alleged\nin the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment.\n\nIII. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial\n\n“The term ‘unfair prejudice,’ as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some\n\nconcededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different\na\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6698\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page6eof8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v. United States, at l8o. Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4o3 provides that “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value\nis substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, ... or by considerations of ...\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.” The Advisory Commitee Notes to Rule 4o3\ndefine “undue prejudice” as an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” See United States v. Salim, l89 F. Supp.\n2d 93, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nHere, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice\nto Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues. Introduction of Exhibits 25l and 288 will likely\nnecessitate Defense production of evidence surrounding the photographs including testimony\n{+ol7\n\nThere is no Government witness who claims that they ever saw or used the “Twin\nTorpedos” allegedly seized in 2oo5. To the extent the Government claims the items are relevant\nto establish that Epstein used sex toys, any probative value of this “fact” is outweighed by\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe 2ol9 <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of Ms. Maxwell have no role in any allegation here. To the extent\nthat the Government claims that they intend to establish an intimate relationship between Ms.\nMaxwell and Mr. Epstein, that fact is provable by other photographs and testimony.\n\nThe Manual contains multiple hearsay statements and reflects a lifestyle that many jurors\nmay find offensive.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

(Def. Mot. l3 at\n2-3). Government Exhibit 294 displays a box containing “Twin Torpedos”—sex toys—seized\nduring the search of Epstein’s Palm Beach house. This <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is corroborative of witness\ntestimony, which is expected to describe the presence of sex toys and that the defendant and\nEpstein used sex toys during their abuse.\n\nFifth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 3l3 is irrelevant.

This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the relationship\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary foundation, is\nhearsay, and is irrelevant because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment.

First, I must\n\nl4 determine whether the pretrial identification procedures were\nl5 unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures\n\nl6 include using a very small number of photographs, making\n\nl7 suggestive comments, or the display of the accused in a way\n\nl8 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an\nl9 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be\n2o the culprit.

Nathan\nUnited States District Court\nSouthern District of New York\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nRe: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nThe government contends that Ms. Maxwell should be precluded from admiting into\nevidence a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> offered while cross-examining Jane during the government’s case-in-\nchief. The government says that Ms. Maxwell did not disclose the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> as part of her\nreciprocal discovery obligations, thereby violating Rule l6(b)(l)(A). The government is wrong.\n\nThe language of Rule l6(b)(l)(A) is plain and unambiguous: Its reciprocal discovery\nobligations apply only to material Ms. Maxwell intends to use during her “case-in-chief.” The\nRule says:\n\n(b) Defendant’s Disclosure.\n\n(l) Information Subject to Disclosure.\n(A) Documents and Objects. If a defendant requests disclosure\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E) and the government complies, then the\ndefendant must permit the government, upon request, to inspect and\nto copy or <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> books, papers, documents, data, photographs,\ntangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of\nthese items if:\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 2\n(i) the item is within the defendant’s possession, custody, or control;\nand\n(i) the defendant intends to use the item in the defendant’s case-in-\nchief at trial.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) (emphasis added).\n\nUnder subsection (b)(l)(A)(il), a defendant’s reciprocal discovery obligations are limited\nto material—specifically books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects,\nbuildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items—that she intends to use in her\n“case-in-chief.”\n\nIn turn, a party’s “case-in-chief” includes only “[t]he evidence presented at trial by a\nparty between the time the party calls the first witness and the time the party rests.” Black’s Law\nDictionary (llth ed. 2ol9). By definition, therefore, a defendant’s “case-in-chief” does not\ninclude her cross-examination of a prosecution witness during the government’s “case-in-chief.”\n\nHere, Ms. Maxwell has not called her first witness. Only the government has called\nwitnesses. The case is currently in the government’s “case-in-chief,” and Ms. Maxwell’s “case-\nin-chief” has not yet started. Because Ms. Maxwell has not begun her case-in-chief, she had no\nobligation under Rule l6(b)(l)(A) to disclose the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> she offered in evidence while\ncross-examining Jane.\n\nThere is no doubt Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not apply to material a defendant offers into\nevidence while cross-examining witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief. The l974\nCommitee Notes to Rule l6 say this expressly: “Subdivision (b)(l)(A) provides that the\ndefendant shall disclose any documents and tangible objects which he has in his possession,\ncustody, or control and which he intends to introduce in evidence in his case in chief.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. l6, Commitee Notes to l974 Amendment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page3of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nCases hold the same. E.g., United States v. Medearis, 38o F.3d lo49, lo57 (8th Cir.\n2oo4) (Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not require defense to disclose evidence he does “not seek to use . .\n. in his case-in-chief”); United States v. Moore, 2o8 F.3d 577, 579 (7th Cir. 2ooo) (Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) does not require defense to disclose evidence used to impeach “the testimony of a\nwitness for the prosecution,” because that is not evidence introduced in a defendant’s “‘case-in-\nchief”).!\n\nAs Judge Easterbrook recognized, the government’s contrary argument in this case\n“sorely misunderstands what it means to offer ‘evidence in chief? (or evidence in one’s ‘case in\nchief’).” Moore, 2o8 F.3d at 579. In fact, so obviously wrong is the government’s interpretation\nof Rule l6 that, when the government offered the same argument in United States v. Moore,\nJudge Easterbrook concluded that the district court commited a plain error in excluding a leter\nthe defense offered into evidence while cross-examining a prosecution witness during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief. /d.\n\nThe government is also wrong to suggest that even if Ms. Maxwell did not have to\ndisclose statements used as impeachment while cross-examining a prosecution witness during\nthe government’s case-in-chief, she did have to disclose other exhibits used as impeachment,\nsuch as the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> she offered into evidence while cross-examining Jane. Under Rule l6(b)\n\n‘Nor does Rule l6(b)(l)(A) apply to material a defendant uses to refresh a witness’s\nrecollection while cross-examining her during the government’s case-in-chief. United States v.\nGray-Burriss, 79l F.3d 5o, 57-58 & n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2ol5) (using documents to refresh\nrecollection of government’s witnesses not covered by Rule l6); United States v. King, 7o3 F.2d\nll9, l26 n.6 (Sth Cir. l983) (noting that “even though the documents were excluded from\nevidence” because of defendant’s failure to make a Rule l6 disclosure, “[d]efense counsel was\nalloued to use the documents to refresh the recollection of witnesses”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008197.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page4of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ms. Maxwell can impeach a prosecution witness’s testimony with any\nadmissible exhibit. The decision in United States v. Hatfield makes this clear.\n\nIn Hatfield, the government sought a Rule l6(b)(l)(A) order compelling the defendant to\ndisclose six categories of evidence:\n\n(l) the Tactical Armor Products, Inc. computers and servers, as described in the\n\ntestimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (2) all computers of DHB Industries, Inc.,\n\nas described in the testimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (3) all computers\n\npersonally used by and/or issued to David H. Brooks; (4) all Toshiba laptops issued\n\nby DHB to Dawn Schlegel; (5) the stationery books obtained by David Brooks from\n\nthe “Joon” stationary store; and (6) the binder prepared by Caroline Pang containing\n\n2oo3 Monthly Point Blank Body Armor (“PBBA”) inventory reports.\n\nUnited States v. Hatfield, No. o6-CR-o55o, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2oo9).\nThe district court refused the government’s request, as should this Court. As Judge Seybert\nexplained:\n\nBecause [the defendant] will not be using these items to support his case in chief,\n\n[he] is not required to disclose the items under Rule l6....\n\nThe Court rejects the Government’s argument that [the defendant] is\nrequired to turn over the above documents pursuant to Rule l6 because [the\ndefendant] may use the items to impeach Government witnesses. Rule l6 mandates\ndisclosure of any documents and tangible objects that the defendant will use in his\ncase-in-chief, and not items which the defendant will use to impeach witnesses.\n\nHatfield, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *l-2 (citing Medearis & Moore) (full citations omited). See\n\nalso United States v. Cerro, 775 F.2d 9o8, 9l5 (7th Cir. l985) (‘Pretrial discovery of federal\n\ncriminal defendants is regulated in detail by Rules l2.l, l2.2, and l6 of the Federal Rules of\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008198.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page5of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 5\nCriminal Procedure, and nothing in any of them suggests that impeachment evidence is\ndiscoverable.”).\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell offered the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> while cross-examining Jane during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief and not as “evidence in chief” during her oun “case-in-chief,”\nMoore, 2o8 F.3d at 579, she did not violate Rule l6, and there is no basis to preclude her from\nadmiting the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> into evidence.\n\nBut even if the government’s reading of Rule l6(b)(l)(A) were right (which it isn’t), and\neven if Ms. Maxwell had violated Rule l6 (which she didn’t), exclusion would still not be the\nproper remedy. “Ifa party fails to comply with [Rule l6], the court may: (A) order that party to\npermit the discovery or inspection; specify its time, place, and manner; and prescribe other just\nterms and conditions; (B) grant a continuance; (C) prohibit that party from introducing the\nundisclosed evidence; or (D) enter any other order that is just under the circumstances.” Fed. R.\nl6(d)(2)(A)-(D). Prohibiting a party from introducing the evidence is the most extreme sanction\navailable, and it requires proof that the belated disclosure prejudiced the government. See United\nStates v. Monsanto Lopez, 798 F. App’x 688, 69o (2d Cir. 2o2o); see also Passlogix, Inc. v. 2FA\nTech., LLC, 7o8 F. Supp. 2d 378, 42l (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (“Preclusion is a harsh sanction\npreserved for exceptional cases where a . . . party’s failure to provide the requested discovery\nresults in prejudice to the requesting party.”).”\n\n> It is well-setled that “[t]o exclude evidence on the grounds of a discovery violation, a\ncriminal defendant must shou prejudice resulting from the government’s untimely disclosure of\nevidence. .. .” United States v. Cantoni, No. l8-CR-562 (ENV), 2ol9 WL l264899, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2ol9) (quotation omited). Considering that the constitution imposes the\nburden of proof in a criminal trial on the government, surely the same rule applies when the shoe\nis (allegedly) on the other foot.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page6of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 6\n\nHere, there is no prejudice, and the government did not atempt to identify any.\nMoreover, any conceivable prejudice can be remedied by giving the government additional time\nto review the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> before Ms. Maxwell again offers it into evidence. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Kessler, 926 F.3d 49o, 49l (8th Cir. 2ol9) (concluding that court was correct not to\nexclude government’s evidence of “the dollar value of the methamphetamine,” despite Rule l6\nviolation, because the court “provided a one-hour recess that alloued defense counsel to prepare\na response”).>\n\nThe government’s interpretation of Rule l6, if accepted, would violate Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights to due process and the confrontation. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.\nCompelling Ms. Maxwell to disclose to the prosecution, in advance, evidence she intends to use\nto impeach government witnesses during the government’s case-in-chief would\nunconstitutionally force her to aid the government in meeting its burden of proof. U.S. Const.\namend. V. See People v. Kilgore, 455 P.3d 746, 75l (Colo. 2o2o) (compelling the defendant to\ndisclose his intended exhibits, “at a minimum, potentially infringed on [his] right to due process\nbecause his compliance with the disclosure order may help the prosecution meet its burden of\nproof’). And it would compromise her constitutional right to confront the witnesses against her,\na right she is free to exercise without previewing her defense for the government. U.S. Const.\namend. VI.\n\n> Of course, come tomorrou, the government will have had more than twelve hours to\nreview the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008200.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page7of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Discussion\n\nCertain photographs in the 9oo series are strongly corroborative of specific statements\nmade by Jane. In defense counsel’s words, Jane’s recollection “of everything . . . is critical to the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page3of9\ncase,” and “[h]er memory of every single detail of her childhood is central to the case.” (l2/ol/2l\nTr. at 4l3). Accordingly, photographs that corroborate Jane’s testimony are highly relevant.\n\nThere are two sets of photographs that are particularly corroborative: photographs of\nEpstein’s massage room and photographs that corroborate details of other portions of Epstein’s\nhouse.\n\nA. The Massage Room\n\nJane testified that she was sexually abused in the massage room of Epstein’s New York\nhouse, and she gave detailed testimony about permanent features of the room. Photographs taken\nof the massage room specifically corroborate that testimony.”\n\nJane described the walls of the room: “[I]t was very dark,” “I don’t knou if it was painted\ndark, but — or maybe that was the lighting, but it sort of had this, like, red mood. And then there\nwas just a giant black massage table in the middle of it.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o). More generally,\nshe testified that the house was decorated with “fabric wallpaper, like red curtains.” (ll/3o/2l Tr.\nat 3l8).\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibit 9o3, among other photos of the massage room, the\nmassage room has reddish dark walls with wallpaper and red curtains. A large massage table is\nlocated in the middle of the room:\n\n[Redacted]\nJane explained that the room had a “built-in bookcase on the right-hand side, and there was\na stereo system.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o).\n2 In particular, the Government seeks admission of Government Exhibits 9o2 through 9o4, 9l7,\nand 928.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page4of9\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibit 928, the massage room in fact has a large built-in\nbookcase with a stereo system:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nJane also testified that the massage room was approximately the size of a “giant walk-in\ncloset.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 32o). And more generally, she testified that the building itself had “Lots\nof stone, you knou, old wood.” (/d. at 3l7-l8).\n\nAs depicted in Government Exhibits 9o4 and 9l7, the massage room is about the size of a\nwalk-in closet, and the moldings in the massage room were made of wood:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nFinally, Jane explained that the artwork in the house included “Paintings of naked women\nand orgies and things like that.” So much so, in fact, that “[i]t didn’t seem very unusual at this\npoint.” (ll/3o/2o2l Tr. at 3l8).\n\nThat description is accurate, as evident from the above photos. It is also accurate with\nrespect to other photos of the massage room, including Government Exhibit 9o2, a photo of the\nentrance to the massage room:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThese photos readily surmount the lou bar of relevance. They specifically corroborate\nJane’s memories of the room in which she was sexually abused, shouing that in fact she spent\ntime in that room, a critical fact of the case.\n\nThe Government understands the Court’s point that there has not been testimony\nspecifically comparing these particular photographs to items present during the time period of the\nconspiracy. But most of Jane’s testimony about the massage room does not concern “movable\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page5of9\nitems.” (l2/3/2l Tr. at lo76). Much of it concerns fixtures: the room’s size, its dark and reddish\nwallpaper and curtains, its built-in bookcase, and its wooden molding. Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the massage room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular nude artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of naked\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou relevance.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York massage room. It was dark, red, with curtains, a built-in bookcase, and a stereo\nsystem. It was in a house decorated with wood, wallpaper, and artwork shouing nude women.\nThe jury will knou full well, and the defense will surely argue, that time has passed since the mid-\nl99os. But that argument goes to weight, not whether the evidence is relevant at all. A jury could\nreasonably conclude that it is no coincidence that these photos match Jane’s description—it is\nbecause Jane has been in this room.\n\nIf the Court remains concerned about the relevance of movable property, the Government\ncan offer photos that redact the artwork. But the photographs of the massage room are probative\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page6of9\nevidence on a material mater, and they should be admited.\n\nB. Other Photographs\n\nMany of the remaining photographs of Epstein’s house corroborate other testimony by\nJane. As with the nude pictures in the massage room, each of these photographs is consistent with\ntestimony about Epstein’s practices, so they are probative corroboration of that testimony.\n\nFirst, Jane testified that Epstein used vibrators and back massagers of sizes while abusing\nher. (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 3lo). Juan Alessi, whose testimony corroborated Jane, also testified that he\nfound two different kinds of vibrating back massagers after Epstein received massages, and that\nthose massagers were kept in Epstein’s bathroom in Palm Beach. (l2/o2/2l Tr. at 894-95).\n\nThe Government recovered two vibrating massagers in the bathroom of the New York\nhome adjacent to the massage room. The Government therefore seeks admission of two photos,\nGovernment Exhibits 9l8 and 92l, depicting those two devices:\n\n[Redacted]\nThe point of this evidence is not to shou that these vibrators are the particular vibrators used on\nJane. It is to shou that they are the type that were used on Jane, and corroborate Jane’s testimony\nby shouing that Epstein did, consistent with the modus operandi of the conspiracy from the mid-\nl99os through the early 2ooos, possess this sort of massager device.\n\nSecond, Jane testified that the home contained “creepy looking animals.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at\n3 The Government could not elicit testimony from Jane about these photographs without\nsubstantially diminishing the probative force of the evidence. Before shouing the photographs to\nJane on the stand, the Government would surely need to shou her the photographs in advance.\nDoing so would permit an inference that Jane tailored her testimony about her memories of the\nmassage room to the photographs, thereby vitiating the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page/7of9\n3o5). This comment about Epstein’s distinct decorating style may seem implausible to jurors. But\nthe Government observed and photographed more than one stuffed animal that could fairly be\ndescribed as “creepy looking” during its search of Epstein’s house, including as depicted in\nGovernment Exhibit 9387:\n\n[Redacted]\n\nThe fact that this stuffed tiger is movable property is counterbalanced by the fact that it is\nhighly idiosyncratic. While the Government would not argue that Epstein had this particular\nstuffed tiger in his home in the mid-l99os, it is probative of Jane’s testimony that—at any point in\ntime—Epstein possessed the kind of “creepy looking animals” that she described.\n\nThird, the Government would offer six photos—Government Exhibits 9o9 through 9ll,\n9l3, 9l5, and 933—to demonstrate structural features of the house. Some of these photographs\nwill provide context for the law enforcement officer’s testimony by shouing the entrance areas of\nthe house which she searched. And all of them will corroborate Jane’s testimony that the house\nwas intimidating and contains significant amounts of wood and stone, as Jane stated. (ll/3o/2l\nTr. at 3l7-l8 (describing the house as “massive” and made her feel “Intimidated.”); 32o\n(explaining that the house had “Lots of stone, you knou, old wood.”)). Neither of these theories\ninvolve movable property of any kind, and the Government would not argue that any movable\nfurniture or artwork was present when Jane visited the house.”\n\nFourth, Epstein’s home contained a large number of photographs of celebrities, including\n* A stuffed dog is also depicted in Government Exhibit 936.\n> The Government also notes that the Court has already ruled that it will reserve, subject to\nconnection, on the admissibility of costumes from the search, which are marked as physical\nexhibits and depicted in Government Exhibits 9l9 and 92o. (l2/o3/2l Tr. at 929). The\nGovernment similarly will offer Government Exhibits 9l9 and 92o subject to connection.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo822o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page 8of9\nphotos of the defendant and Epstein with celebrities, and additional artwork depicting nude\nwomen. The Government does not currently intend to offer exhibits depicting those photographs\nor artwork, but it does intend to elicit testimony from the law enforcement witness that the home\ncontained those items. That testimony is further corroboration of Jane’s general knouledge of\ncategories of decorations Epstein preferred, but it contains no suggestion that any particular exhibit\ncorroborates Jane’s testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defense has not raised a Rule 4o3 prejudice\nargument, and for good reason. None of the evidence in this category is prejudicial to the defense.\nThere will be no suggestion that the defendant or Epstein possessed these particular items during\nthe time period of the conspiracy, and the defense is free to argue that the distance in time\nundermines the probative force of the evidence. But whether that probative force is significant (as\nthe Government suggests) or minimal (as the defense suggests), the defense is not prejudiced by\npictures of a massager, a stuffed tiger, or photos of structural features of Epstein’s home.\n\nIl. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, photographs from the 9oo series of Government Exhibits should\nbe admited.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo822l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525 Filed l2/o5/2l Pagelof9\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

And the things depicted, elaborated the Court, were\n“highly mobile items”:\n\nYou could have, and you should have, shoun them to [Jane] after she provided the\n\ntestimony. The problem is, it’s l5 years since the end of the conspiracy, it’s 2o-\n\nsome years since her testimony. I’ve looked at case law on this. Older photographs\n\nof immovable objects and structure may be relevant, and to the extent you have a\n\nwitness testifying saying it is similar to what I saw or specifically saying it’s similar\n\nin this way or dissimilar in that way, it would be permited.\n\nIn the absence of that, we’re talking about very movable items and a\nsubstantially long period of time.

The law does not support inclusion in this context without a witness\ntestifying as to the similarity of what -- you’re trying to corroborate that these\nphotos shou what it looked like then. You have a witness who can do that, but in\nthe absence of that, I’m sustaining the objection.

And when a “<span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> fails to portray\nthe relevant facts with complete accuracy, such as if changed conditions have occurred, it may be\nmisleading.” § 2l5.

The government, therefore, has not\nauthenticated the photos, and the evidence is irrelevant and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\n\nThe government devotes six pages of its leter to the 2ol9 photos of the massage room.\nGov. Leter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o.

This is a baseless argument.\n\nThe government easily could have shoued the photographs to Jane for the first time\nduring her testimony, asked her if she recognized them, asked whether the photos accurately\ndepicted the house and massage room as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or at least asked if\nthe photographs looked similar to what the apartment looked like back then. In turn, once the\ngovernment elicited testimony from another witness about when the photographs were taken, it\ncould have moved to admit them. This procedure would have addressed the government’s\nconcer about preserving the photographs as independent corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The\nonly conceivable thing stopping the government from doing this was a concern that Jane would\nnot give the answer the government wanted.\n\nBut even if this procedure would have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration,” that’s just hou trials go. Sometimes tradeoffs are necessary to comply with the\nrules of evidence.

Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov.

If they were “the type,” Jane could easily have said so on the stand.\n\nThe tiger next. Jane testified that Mr. Epstein had “animals” and “animal heads” and\n“strange things” in the house that were “a litle creepy personally.” /d. at 3l8:5-l3. She did not\ntestify or describe a tiger.

The Government\nnever advanced a theory that the illegal sexual activity identified in the S2 Indictment was sexual\nactivity that occurred outside New York.\n\nAt trial, the Government marshalled evidence that the defendant knouingly transported\nJane to New York, and aided and abeted Epstein in doing so, with the intent that Jane engage in\ncriminal sexual activity there in violation of New York law. That evidence included testimony\nfrom Jane in detail about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr. 3l6-l9) and specific sexual acts that\ntook place in New York while Jane was a minor (Tr. 3l9-2o). As the defendant rightly concedes,\n“most of [Jane’s] trips were to New York” and “the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips\nconsisted of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced\nthere.” (Def.

In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking conspiracy who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. Geographic Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking conspiracy which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on interstate commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines.

Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took nude photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010710.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675 Filed o6/25/22 Pagel9of2l\nthe dozens and dozens of other co—conspirators who were an essential part of the Maxwell/Epstein\nconspiracy to sexually abuse dozens and dozens of young women and girls.\n\nSarah and Elizabeth are entitled to read aloud their victim impact statements at Maxwell’s\ncriminal sentencing.

In her ex-parte\napplication, Ms. Maxwell provided reasons for requesting certain items of evidence, including\nthat the government either failed to secure the evidence or refused to produce it to Ms. Maxwell;\nshe also disclosed theories related to her defense, strategy, and work product.\nAfter considering the application and BSF’s response, the Court invited comment from\nthe government regarding subpoenaed items 9 (a journal), lo (boots), and ll(photographs).\nSpecifically, the Court directed the government “to notify the Court of its views as to Requests 9\nthrough ll.” Dkt. 252.\nThe government’s position is consistent with its general approach to evidence in this case\nwhich is to blindly accept information it considers unfavorable to Ms. Maxwell, begrudgingly\nDOJ-OGR-oooll24l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011246.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 6ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The indictment\nand the accusers are vague regarding when things happened, what things happened and who may\nhave been present when anything is alleged to have happened. Accuser-2’s journal contains\ndated entries that place events in context with other alleged events. Accuser-2’s journal from\nl996 purports to document encounters with Epstein in New York. The S2 indictment, paragraph\n9(b), claims that “Maxwell interacted with [Accuser-2] on at least one occasion in or about l996\nat Epstein’s residence in New Mexico....” The journal references other dates, places, and events\nin l996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell in context with other recorded events is\nboth relevant and exculpatory.\n\nAs a piece of physical evidence, the journal is subject to inspection and testing. See F. R.\nCrim. P. l7(c)(l). Moreover, were the journal in the possession of the government it would be\nsubject to inspection under F. R. Crim. P. l6 (a) (l) (E) which provides, in relevant part:\n\nUpon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to\ninspect and to copy or <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> books, papers, documents, data,\nphotographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of\nany of these items, if the tem is within the government's possession,\ncustody, or control and:\n\n(i) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial[.]\n\nTo avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted partisan\nphotocopies of five substantive pages without questioning the provenance of an exhibit it intends\nto introduce at trial. Comparison of one of the five pages demonstrates the problem. Atached as\nexhibit A is a photocopy of a journal entry first produced during the civil litigation.

The remaining six pages are identical except for the identifying bate ranges.\nExamination of the original document would answer legitimate questions about whether the\ndocument has been manipulated, altered, or fabricated. Disclosure of the document in advance of\ntrial would prevent the unnecessary delay of having a qualified forensic document examiner take\npossession of the document, run tests, and offer an opinion during the middle of trial.\n\nRequest lo, the Boots\n\nThe Court directed the government “‘to notify the Court of its views” regarding item lo.\nInstead of notifying the Court of its “views” the government, houever, has taken steps to\ncircumvent the pending defense subpoena request; it is “working to moot request lo” by having\nthe FBI secure the boots, Dkt. 269, p.2. This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to\ninvestigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original\nrequest was ex parte, nou the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms.\nMaxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of\nevidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the\nsubpoena, not to the government.\n\nRequest ll, the Photographs\n\nRegarding item ll, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical\npositions. In its leter of May 4, 2o2l, the government first advised the Court that it obtained\n“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.\nTwo days later it admited that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution\nTeam’s possession” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 8ofl2\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The government does not explain which original photographs it has in its possession nor\ndoes it offer any reason why these photographs were not made available “upon request.”\nAtempts to confer with the government to explain these discrepancies have gone unanswered for\ndays.\n\nPhotocopies, in most cases, (and most certainly in this case) are not adequate substitutes\nfor originals, particularly when the photocopies are produced by lawyers adverse to Ms.\nMaxwell, were not collected by law enforcement directly from the source, and are subject to\nmanipulation. Any original photographs will have markings that identify when the film was\ndeveloped and other indicia indicating whether they are genuine or not. Again, like the journal,\nthe government has outsourced the fact and truth finding function regarding the photographs to\npartisan advocates. If the government possessed the originals Ms. Maxwell would have the Rule\nl6 right to inspect them, just like the many photographs she inspected between April l2 and\nApril l6, 2o2l.\n\nFinally, the government devotes much of its submission atempting to bait Ms. Maxwell\ninto revealing defense strategy and work product.

The Court should preclude this testimony, which does not contradict\nJane’s, and is in any event improper impeachment about a topic of cross-examination that is\ncollateral to the case.\n\nFirst, the anticipated testimony does not contradict Jane’s. Jane testified that she had told\nthe Government that she remembered group sexualized massages involving “Eva,” “Michelle,”\nand “Kelly.” Defense counsel did not ask Jane, and Jane did not testify, that these people were\nEva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino. The defense had an opportunity to elicit specific\nnames or identities from Jane, such as by eliciting a last name or pointing to a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>, but they\nchose not to do so. Indeed, defense counsel elicited no description of Eva, and only elicited that\nMichelle was “short.” (Tr. 527). With respect to Kelly, defense counsel only asked whether Jane\ntold the Government that Kelly was an older model whose last name Jane knew—but then chose\nnot to elicit that last name. (/d.)\n\nHaving failed to develop the record, defense counsel cannot nou atempt to impeach Jane’s\ntestimony by calling specific individuals they claim are Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Indeed, as\ndefense counsel is aware, Jane had previously been asked in meetings with the Government about\nEva Dubin, and she answered that she knew Dubin and “does not remember DUBIN being\ninvolved in massages.” See 35o9-o2o at l. That is, Jane knous who Eva Dubin is and has denied\nthat Eva Dubin was involved in sexualized massages. See id.!

He is\nexpected to testify that a clone is an exact copy of one piece of media to another.\nExaminer Flatley is expected to explain that he connected Government Exhibits 54\nand 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact copy, of the\nexhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices\nbecause he ran a hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on\nthe original devices and the images, which are identical.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that\nGovernment Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for\nGovernment Exhibits 55 and 54, respectively.

The government’s other arguments fail.\n\nThe government offers three other arguments. First, the government faults Ms. Maxwell\nfor not shouing Jane pictures of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do\nthat, and the government cites no authority for its argument.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that the government never shoued Jane their photographs. The\ngovernment’s deliberate choice to muddy the waters is not Ms. Maxwell’s fault or her problem.\nThe record shous Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are the “Eva,” “Michelle,” and\n“Kelly” who Jane testified about. Their testimony is admissible.\n\nSecond, it’s irrelevant that Ms. Maxwell did not use last names in her examination of\nJane. For one thing, Jane also did not use last names in her interviews with the FBI. For another\nthing, Eva Dubin’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name. Finally, Ms. Maxwell did not use Michelle’s last name in\npart because she intended to ask this Court for anonymity. It’s immaterial that this Court\nsubsequently denied that request.\n\nFinally, the government mistakenly relies on cases purporting to hold that a defendant,\nthrough cross-examination, cannot open the door to proving collateral issues by extrinsic\n\n> The government quite rightly does not make a 4o3 argument.

Well, cringey enough, I wrote, thanks for rocking my world.\n2l Q. Why did you write that?\n22 A. Well, my mother made me send him a picture after I had\n23 goten my first big job, and that's when I had taken this\n24 picture and, in fairness, I used to write really bad captions\n25 for people when I would write -- sign a headshot.

EVERDELL: The first witness -- and this relates\nll to the Florida -- the search of the Palm Beach residence. I\n\nl2 believe Mr. Parkinson, who I believe is going to testify after\nl3 Mr. Alessi, is the agent who went through during the search, of\nl4 October 2oth of 2oo5, of that residence. He did the video\n\nl5 walk-through of the residence. So there is video and he was\n\nl6 present. I believe he's going to say he was present when\n\nl7 photographs were taken of various rooms and things in the\n\nl8 house. Those are going to be offered through him.\n\nl9 So there are three things to talk about here with\n2o Mr. Parkinson. There is the exhibits — the photographs — the\n2l video, and the certain testimony.\n22 We'll start with the exhibits, the photographs.\n23 We already moved in limine to exclude one of the\n24 photographs, that was Government Exhibit 288.

That was\n2 excluded by your Honor on motions in limine. There is a\n\n3 Similar photo, it's the same photo. The one we excluded was\n\n4 that <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> which was hanging on the wall, it was on the\n\n5 floor, but Government Exhibit 27o was the same <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> on\n\n6 the wall. There is consent to that one. Yes, we agreed that\n\n7 that would not be offered. So 27o is not going to be offered.\n8 There was one that we didn't reach agreement on, which\n9 is Government Exhibit 25o. In the motions in limine, your\n\nlo Honor, you excluded Government Exhibit 25l, which, if you\n\nll recall, was a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of a toddler, an infant walking\n\nl2 forward touards the camera with an adult in the back, naked,\n\nl3 and excluded it on 4ol and 4o3 grounds.\n\nl4 There is another photo, which is Government Exhibit\n\nl5 25o, which shous -- maybe we can pull that up if we can see it.\nl6 Is it on your screen, your Honor?\n\nl7 THE COURT: Yes.\n\nl8 MR. EVERDELL: That, as you can see, depicts Jeffrey\nl9 Epstein with a slightly older girl. At this point, I believe\n2o it is the same girl with her lying across his lap with her\n2l botom -- although with underwear on, but he's got his head\n22 doun close to the botom.\n23 I think, for similar reasons, this is not relevant and\n24 is prejudicial. It shous him with a prepubescent girl.

This is, I\n\n2 believe, the same girl as the toddler photo. It's his\n\n3 goddaughter. But if the jury sees a photo like this, they may\n4 draw some inappropriate assumptions about his proclivities, and\na we think this should be excluded on relevance and 4o3 ground\n\n6 prejudice.\n\n7 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think it would make sense to\n8 take this up with another exhibit from the same witness because\n9 our arguments are the same as to both.\n\nlo With respect to Government Exhibit 296, which is the\nll walk-through video, it's about a 4o-minute video, I don't\n\nl2 expect to play all of it for the jury, but in the walk-through,\nl3 you can see that when walking from the top of the staircase on\nl4 the second floor through the anteroom into the master bedroom,\nl5 that prominently displayed is the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> displayed in\n\nl6 Government Exhibit 27o, which your Honor excluded. It is\n\nl7 briefly shoun on the screen, but in context, it's clear that it\nl8 is the primary decoration right outside of the master bedroom\nl9 that the defendant shared with Mr. Epstein. So, I would like\n2o to take that exhibit up at the same time because I think the\n2l arguments are the same.\n22 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. I can address\n23 that.\n24 THE COURT: Okay.\n25 MR.

COMEY: Your Honor, we consent to the exclusion of\n4 the other <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> because we understand your Honor's ruling\n5 about the prejudice, especially when taken out of context, but\n6 here the probative value is extraordinary when it is taken in\n\n7 context, especially after Mr. Alessi's testimony about the fact\n8 that the defendant spent the majority of her nights in this\n\n9 bedroom with Mr. Epstein and the testimony that this is where\nlo many of the massages took place that are the subject of the\n\nll charges here.

This <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>, right outside the bedroom that the\n\n3 defendant shared with him, directly contradicts that argument.\n4 THE COURT: I want to make sure I understand the last\n5 point. The last point is that it contradicts the argument\n\n6 because why?\n\n7 MS.

So the fact that Mr. Epstein would choose to\n\nll prominently display such a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> right outside his master\nl2 bedroom contradicts a suggestion that there was some sort of\n\nl3 halo effect around him for the defendant, because I believe the\nl4 defense is seting up an argument that the defendant couldn't\nl5 have possibly knoun that Mr. Epstein was atracted to underage\nl6 females because he was surrounded with, by, and spent so much\nl7 time with such important and prominent people, and that\n\nl8 somebody who spent so much time with such important prominent\nl9 people couldn't possibly have such a vile atraction to\n2o underage girls. This <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is directly contradicting that\n2l argument.\n22 THE COURT: So you do think it's evidence of\n23 atraction to prepubescent girls?\n24 MS.

And the point here is that\n\n4 the defendant knew not only the public persona, but the private\n5 persona, and the private persona included prominently\n\n6 displaying art that sexualized an underage girl.\n\n7 THE COURT: All right. Anything further?\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think that this is\n9 connected in one way at all. I think if you asked any parent\nlo about, do they have like a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of their child as a\n\nll toddler or their goddaughter as a toddler, like in the swimming\nl2 pool or something where they're not wearing any clothe, they\n\nl3 probably have one of those things. Nou, whether they display\nl4 that on their walls, that's another question, but these are not\nl5 photographs that are indicative of his lifestyle.\n\nl6 The problem is in this case, because of the nature of\nl7 the subject mater, if a juror sees that, they're probably\n\nl8 going to leap that to that assumption, that it's not just --\n\nl9 the allegations in this case are women -- are girls that are\n2o under the age, but just under the age of consent, l5, l6, l7,\n2l not girls that are 5, 6, 7, prepubescent females. If they see\n22 that, then they're going to drew an inappropriate conclusion,\n23 which I don't think the government is even arguing, and that is\n24 a really big 4o3 prejudice problem. And that's the issue we're\n25 trying to avoid, which is why we moved in limine and why we\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012523.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9 of 236 9l3\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl made those arguments before.

We've already had\n2 a lot of testimony about hou there were frequent renovations to\n3 these places, we had testimony from Juan Alessi about that, and\n4 so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this\n\na tounhouse looked the way it did in 2ol9, whether it looked the\n6 same way in l994 to 2oo4, which is the time period of the\n\n7 conspiracy.

I believe the only witness they have\n\nl8 testified so far, and maybe the only one they can offer, is\n\nl9 Jane, who testified very, very generally and very briefly about\n2o hou the New York tounhouse looked on the inside. She said\n2l something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark,\n22 there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we\n23 had.

Conway, 2oo7WL9225o72, Western District\n23 of New York, June 25, 2oo7.\n24 The defense argues that admission of the photos is not\n25 merely a mater of relevance and prejudice under 4ol and 4o3,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2758\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012759.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page8 of 26l ll48\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl but also of authentication under Rule 9ol, a proposition for\n\n2 which the defense cites a Ninth Circuit case from l977, United\n3 States v.

Rule 9ol requires that the proponent must\n5 produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item\n6 is what the proponent claims it is. Here, the government\n\n7 claims that the photographs are of Epstein's apartment in 2ol9,\n8 a claim that I understand will be provided via testimony and\n\n9 that the defense does not dispute. Whether those photos taken\nlo in 2ol9 are probative of hou the apartment appeared in l994 is\nll a question of relevance under Rule 4ol to be balanced with 4o3,\nl2 not of authentication. See United States v. Certified\n\nl3 Environmental Services Inc., 753 F.3d 72 at 9o, which is a\n\nl4 Second Circuit decision from 2ol4 I'll quote here.

That case\n\nl8 quotes itself from another Second Circuit case, Fitzgerald v.\nl9 Henderson, 25l F.3d 345 at 365, Second Circuit 2ool. Though,\n2o to be clear, the government, as I said, will still need to\n2l authenticate that the photos are of Epstein's apartment in\n22 2ol9.\n23 In any event, even if analyzed under Rule 9l, as I'll\n24 discuss belou in a moment, Jane's testimony about the\n25 distinctive characteristics of Epstein's apartment captured in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012760.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9 of 26l ll49\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl the photos that the Court will admit are a sufficient basis\n\n2 under 9ol(b) (4) which permits authentication based on the\n\n3 appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns or other\n\n4 distinctive characteristics of the item taken together with all\n5 of the circumstances. United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F.Appx\n\n6 2l44, Second Circuit 2o2o.\n\n7 Based on this case law, the Court will address the\n\n8 government's requested photographs specifically.\n\n9 First, the government seeks to admit six photos,\n\nlo Exhibits 9o9 through 9ll, and 9l3, 9l5, and 933 that depict\n\nll structural features of Epstein's apartment.

I admit\n\nl7 these six photos.\n\nl8 Second, I will admit the photos of Epstein's massage\nl9 room, photos 9o2 through 9o4, 9l7 and 928, but only if the\n2o pictures on the wall are redacted. The exhibits could\n2l corroborate several aspects of Jane's testimony, including that\n22 the room was the size of a giant walk-in closet, but space for\n23 a giant massage table in the middle of it.

I believe the\n\nl9 testimony here is that CDs were seized from Jeffrey Epstein's\n2o residence, that they were reviewed by the FBI. So with respect\n2l to authentication, in terms of offering that these are what we\n22 say they are, they are photographs seized from Jeffrey\n23 Epstein's residence on CDs.\n24 Their relevance is selfapparent, given the contents of\n25 the photographs.

There has been witness testimony\n\n2 about the timeframe of that relationship, that it began in the\n3 early '9os. I think the defense has argued that that\n\n4 terminated during certain time periods. But, in short, I think\nS all of Ms. Menninger's arguments are arguments that they are\n\n6 free to make to the jury but have nothing to do with the\n\n7 question of relevance.\n\n8 These items have been thoroughly authenticated and to\n9 the extent the defense wants to offer witnesses about their\n\nlo metadata and make arguments to the jury about what that means\nll or what it doesn't mean, that's for the defense to put before\nl2 the jury.

MOE: Yes, your Honor. Throughout the course of\n2o these photographs.\n2l I would note, your Honor, with respect to the concern\n22 about metadata, it happens often in criminal trials that\n23 electronic evidence is seized, authenticated as such, and\n24 offered before the jury.

But of course that's not what happens. ALL\n4 we do is we offer law enforcement agents who seized these items\n5 and can authenticate them, and if defense wants to make\n\n6 arguments to their relevance or otherwise, that goes to their\n\n7 weight and not their admissibility, and those arguments are for\n8 the jury.\n\n9 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, in many criminal cases,\nlo there are lots of context over what photographs are admissible\nll and for what purpose. For example, if it was a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> that\nl2 was taken inside of a store when there was a robbery that\nl3 purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness\nl4 to say that this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was taken in or near the events and\nl5 that we have reason to believe that nothing inside the store\nl6 has changed. Just shouing photographs that are undated, they\nl7 may be from l975 for all I knou, and shoued the two of them\nl8 together and there is no one to say that it hasn't been altered\nl9 in the meantime, even the lou bar of shouing that the\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> and without a witness to say it is\n2l what it purported to be, I don't think that that is true with\n22 respect to what is admissible for a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>.

So to put in evidence a photo that\n23 they knou is not her of a minor, when there is no charged crime\n24 with respect to photography in this case, your Honor, is\n25 directly contrary to the evidence as the government knous it\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3oo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013004.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 253 of 26l l4l4\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\n\nl exists.\n\n2 And I also would like to say with respect to 3o9, we\n\n3 litigated whether or not we could put in evidence photographs\n\n4 of this witness, and the government called us, I think it was\n\n5 slut shaming when I tried to argue that there were other\n\n6 photographs of this individual that were much like this that\n\n7 she had put out in newspapers, and nou they want to put ona\n\n8 photo of her after she's goten off the stand and not afforded\n9 us the opportunity to cross examine her about similar\n\nlo photographs that she has put out.\n\nll MS.

Is the government's\nl4 representation that the individual depicted in this photo is a\nl5 minor at the time of the photo?\n\nl6 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we made no representations about\nl7 the metadata of the file of this photo. To be short, in\n\nl8 direct, I don't knou. There will be testimony at this trial\n\nl9 and there has been testimony at this trial that this person was\n2o victimized as a minor.\n2l In terms of the particular date of this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>,\n22 we're limited by the information we have in the metadata. I\n23 believe it's for this reason that the defense had noticed\n24 perhaps a metadata expert and the defense will be free to\n25 explore that issue.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool3oo4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00013005.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 254 of 26l l4l5\nLC6Cmax7 Meder - direct\n\nl There are of course limitations on metadata and\n\n2 whether it can tell whether a file was saved on a certain date\n3 or whether a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was taken on a certain date or\n\n4 otherwise. And to the extent the defense wants to put that at\n5 issue, they're certainly welcome to do so.\n\n6 In terms of its relevance, it shous that the nature of\n7 the relationship between the defendant, Epstein, and this\n\n8 victim was of a sexual nature. For example, when Mr. Alessi\n\n9 testified about this victim, I believe the cross examination\n\nlo about that was that she was a professional, that she was at\n\nll Mar-a-Lago, the defendant was only there for a treatment, and I\nl2 believe there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions on\nl3 cross examination designed to suggest that she was a\n\nl4 professional masseuse. And if the defense intends to argue\n\nl5 that this person was a professional masseuse, it is certainly\nl6 relevant in response to that argument that, in fact, Epstein\n\nl7 had a topless <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of her in a location that appears to\nl8 be a tropical island which would be consistent with flight\n\nl9 records along those lines. Again, it goes to the relationship\n2o between the defendant, Epstein, and this victim, that it was of\n2l a sexualized nature, which is consistent with witness\n22 testimony.\n23 With respect to the particular date of the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>,\n24 that is an issue that the defense is certainly free to explore\n25 and put before the jury.

They\n2o don't want her to testify because she has a lot of credibility\n2l problems. So they want to put in evidence that she was a\n22 victim but without having her get on the stand and testify. So\n23 nou they want to get in evidence that she had a topless photo\n24 and no one's going to say when that <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was taken.

And after Jane went\nl5 and became a soap opera star, Jane sent her these photographs.\nl6 And one is of her and there's some of other cast members as\n\nl7 well. And she has the envelope as well.

I mean, if she claims that she left\n\n7 New York and she fled this life with Epstein and didn't want\n\n8 anything more to do with it, this is evidence that she was\n\n9 keeping contact with people in his orbit. Ms. Espinosa worked\nlo in his office and was there with him in the office every day.\nll So it goes to shou that there was a continuing\n\nl2 relationship. She voluntarily sent these photographs to her\n\nl3 shouing that she maintained that relationship voluntarily,\n\nl4 which I think is the opposite of what you would do if what you\nl5 wanted to do was put all this behind you and not be a part of\nl6 this world anymore.\n\nl7 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, my recollection of Jane's\nl8 testimony was that she herself acknouledged that she had\n\nl9 maintained a relationship with some of the individuals and\n2o their orbit on direct examination and in the course of her\n2l testimony.

I mean, if she claims that she left\n\n7 New York and she fled this life with Epstein and didn't want\n\n8 anything more to do with it, this is evidence that she was\n\n9 keeping contact with people in his orbit. Ms. Espinosa worked\nlo in his office and was there with him in the office every day.\nll So it goes to shou that there was a continuing\n\nl2 relationship. She voluntarily sent these photographs to her\n\nl3 shouing that she maintained that relationship voluntarily,\n\nl4 which I think is the opposite of what you would do if what you\nl5 wanted to do was put all this behind you and not be a part of\nl6 this world anymore.\n\nl7 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, my recollection of Jane's\nl8 testimony was that she herself acknouledged that she had\n\nl9 maintained a relationship with some of the individuals and\n2o their orbit on direct examination and in the course of her\n2l testimony.

I suppose you can use this\nl3 one complicated by the fact that my understanding of the\n\nl4 testimony was that she was -—- she said that's the street I\n\nl5 lived on, reading a document that she had never seen before,\n\nl6 from a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> taken in 2o2l.\n\nl7 So I suppose the question is, perhaps you could pick\nl8 another example, or you could imagine that <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> without\nl9 the information --\n2o MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, if I had a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> from\n2l that time period, I certainly would have used it. That's the\n22 only thing available to me.\n23 I would say, your Honor, that the government has just\n24 introduced, today, photographs that were taken in the last year\n25 of Epstein home when we're talking about events that happened\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017598.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 236 of 247 395\nLBUCmax7\n\nl in '94, '95, and '96. So I'm not really sure.\n\n2 THE COURT: There was a witness who testified as to it\n3 being an accurate reflection of what the home looked Like;\n\n4 right?\n\n5 MS. MENNINGER: Without saying when, yes. A witness\n\n6 who continued to work for Mr. Epstein up until 2ol9.\n\n7 THE COURT: I mean, I suppose you're welcome to object\n8 to foundation, but there wasn't an objection to foundation.\n\n9 In any event, you'll brief whether the defense is\n\nlo obligated under Rule l6 to produce in advance to the government\nll documents that clearly -- and we're not talking about\n\nl2 statements.\n\nl3 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor. We're talking\nl4 about an exhibit like a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>, something like this very\n\nl5 exhibit seems like classical l6. So we'll brief it, your\n\nl6 Honor.\n\nl7 THE COURT: Okay. Certainly, there is at least two\n\nl8 Situations. There is the situation in which the witness said\nl9 something and you couldn't have anticipated what they said and\n2o you have something that you want to impeach with it, you\n2l couldn't have produced that in advance. So the question is not\n22 that, but obviously when you anticipate particular testimony\n23 and you have material that you think impeaches that you intend\n24 to introduce as evidence through cross examination. Whether\n25 you're obligated under Rule l6 to turn that over in advance,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 3 of 264 4o9\nLClVMAXl\n\nl And I still don't fully understand the <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of the street\n\n2 that the witness read the line from saying, That's the address\n\n3 where we lived, hou that's impeachment.

I\n\nl2 believe Mr. Parkinson, who I believe is going to testify after\nl3 Mr. Alessi, is the agent who went through during the search, of\nl4 October 2oth of 2oo5, of that residence. He did the video\n\nl5 walk-through of the residence. So there is video and he was\n\nl6 present. I believe he's going to say he was present when\n\nl7 photographs were taken of various rooms and things in the\n\nl8 house. Those are going to be offered through him.\n\nl9 So there are three things to talk about here with\n2o Mr. Parkinson. There is the exhibits — the photographs — the\n2l video, and the certain testimony.\n22 We'll start with the exhibits, the photographs.\n23 We already moved in limine to exclude one of the\n24 photographs, that was Government Exhibit 288.

That was\n2 excluded by your Honor on motions in limine. There is a\n\n3 Similar photo, it's the same photo.

There is consent to that one. Yes, we agreed that\n\n7 that would not be offered. So 27o is not going to be offered.\n8 There was one that we didn't reach agreement on, which\n9 is Government Exhibit 25o. In the motions in limine, your\n\nlo Honor, you excluded Government Exhibit 25l, which, if you\n\nll recall, was a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of a toddler, an infant walking\n\nl2 forward touards the camera with an adult in the back, naked,\n\nl3 and excluded it on 4ol and 4o3 grounds.\n\nl4 There is another photo, which is Government Exhibit\n\nl5 25o, which shous -- maybe we can pull that up if we can see it.\nl6 Is it on your screen, your Honor?\n\nl7 THE COURT: Yes.\n\nl8 MR. EVERDELL: That, as you can see, depicts Jeffrey\nl9 Epstein with a slightly older girl. At this point, I believe\n2o it is the same girl with her lying across his lap with her\n2l botom -- although with underwear on, but he's got his head\n22 doun close to the botom.\n23 I think, for similar reasons, this is not relevant and\n24 is prejudicial.

This is, I\n\n2 believe, the same girl as the toddler photo. It's his\n\n3 goddaughter. But if the jury sees a photo like this, they may\n4 draw some inappropriate assumptions about his proclivities, and\na we think this should be excluded on relevance and 4o3 ground\n\n6 prejudice.\n\n7 MS.

It is\n\nl7 briefly shoun on the screen, but in context, it's clear that it\nl8 is the primary decoration right outside of the master bedroom\nl9 that the defendant shared with Mr. Epstein. So, I would like\n2o to take that exhibit up at the same time because I think the\n2l arguments are the same.\n22 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor.

COMEY: Your Honor, we consent to the exclusion of\n4 the other <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> because we understand your Honor's ruling\n5 about the prejudice, especially when taken out of context, but\n6 here the probative value is extraordinary when it is taken in\n\n7 context, especially after Mr. Alessi's testimony about the fact\n8 that the defendant spent the majority of her nights in this\n\n9 bedroom with Mr. Epstein and the testimony that this is where\nlo many of the massages took place that are the subject of the\n\nll charges here.

This <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span>, right outside the bedroom that the\n\n3 defendant shared with him, directly contradicts that argument.\n4 THE COURT: I want to make sure I understand the last\n5 point. The last point is that it contradicts the argument\n\n6 because why?\n\n7 MS.

So the fact that Mr. Epstein would choose to\n\nll prominently display such a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> right outside his master\nl2 bedroom contradicts a suggestion that there was some sort of\n\nl3 halo effect around him for the defendant, because I believe the\nl4 defense is seting up an argument that the defendant couldn't\nl5 have possibly knoun that Mr. Epstein was atracted to underage\nl6 females because he was surrounded with, by, and spent so much\nl7 time with such important and prominent people, and that\n\nl8 somebody who spent so much time with such important prominent\nl9 people couldn't possibly have such a vile atraction to\n2o underage girls. This <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is directly contradicting that\n2l argument.\n22 THE COURT: So you do think it's evidence of\n23 atraction to prepubescent girls?\n24 MS.

And the point here is that\n\n4 the defendant knew not only the public persona, but the private\n5 persona, and the private persona included prominently\n\n6 displaying art that sexualized an underage girl.\n\n7 THE COURT: All right. Anything further?\n\n8 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't think that this is\n9 connected in one way at all. I think if you asked any parent\nlo about, do they have like a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of their child as a\n\nll toddler or their goddaughter as a toddler, like in the swimming\nl2 pool or something where they're not wearing any clothe, they\n\nl3 probably have one of those things. Nou, whether they display\nl4 that on their walls, that's another question, but these are not\nl5 photographs that are indicative of his lifestyle.\n\nl6 The problem is in this case, because of the nature of\nl7 the subject mater, if a juror sees that, they're probably\n\nl8 going to leap that to that assumption, that it's not just --\n\nl9 the allegations in this case are women -- are girls that are\n2o under the age, but just under the age of consent, l5, l6, l7,\n2l not girls that are 5, 6, 7, prepubescent females. If they see\n22 that, then they're going to drew an inappropriate conclusion,\n23 which I don't think the government is even arguing, and that is\n24 a really big 4o3 prejudice problem. And that's the issue we're\n25 trying to avoid, which is why we moved in limine and why we\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 9 of 236 9l3\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl made those arguments before.

She gave very, very general descriptions of\n22 her recollection of certain residences, not particular\n23 artworks, not particular photographs.\n24 So I don't think it's fair, on the record we have, to\n25 say that this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> being on the wall in 2oo5 — mind you,\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool8ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 236 9l5\nLBUCmaxl\n\nl a year after the last year of the conspiracy charged in this\n\n2 case — is probative of anything about Epstein's circle and what\n3 they might have knoun about him or not knoun about him because\n4 we simply don't knou whether this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was even on the\n\n5 wall.\n\n6 THE COURT: You made your record, I overruled the\n\n7 objection with a limiting instruction as discussed.\n\n8 MR.

This I don't think is sexual,\nl9 but that are not with underage girls, that are with other\n\n2o photos, including people with adults. It's shoun in context in\n2l a series of photos along a bookshelf where people tend to keep\n22 photos, lots of different photos, and it will shou a panoply of\n23 photos that is not one photo of a clearly minor child with him\n24 looking like he's about to bite her backside.

If the government wants to\n\n4 introduce pictures of them, which I knou is Government Exhibits\nS 9l9 and 92o, are photographs of the costumes outside of the box\n6 I believe, and the costumes themselves are Government Exhibit\n\n7 53, the government wants to get the agent to describe certain\n\n8 items they found without exactly describing what they were, but\n9 have those items somewhat generally described and the\n\nlo photographs, you can describe taking a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> of certain\n\nll items, but not described in a way that the jury is going to\n\nl2 knou what they are.

At\n\n3 that point, I would just ask for permission to lead to make\n\n4 sure that we're just laying a foundation without describing\n\n5 those items or otherwise displaying them to the jury.\n\n6 THE COURT: And you could say clearly, without\n\n7 describing the items or shouing them, just look and did you\n\n8 find these items.\n\n9 MS.

We've already had\n2 a lot of testimony about hou there were frequent renovations to\n3 these places, we had testimony from Juan Alessi about that, and\n4 so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this\n\na tounhouse looked the way it did in 2ol9, whether it looked the\n6 same way in l994 to 2oo4, which is the time period of the\n\n7 conspiracy. In fact, quite the opposite. We have every reason\n8 to believe that there were significant changes based on the\n\n9 testimony.\n\nlo So my objection is, your Honor, I don't think, unless\nll they have a witness who can say that these photographs taken in\nl2 2ol9 look Like those rooms that I saw back in '94, '95, or 2oo2\nl3 or some time period that's actually in the conspiracy, and I\n\nl4 don't think they do, then these are irrelevant and they\n\nl5 shouldn't be admited to the jury because there is no basis to\nl6 believe that this is what the place looked like on the inside\nl7 back l5 years before. I believe the only witness they have\n\nl8 testified so far, and maybe the only one they can offer, is\n\nl9 Jane, who testified very, very generally and very briefly about\n2o hou the New York tounhouse looked on the inside. She said\n2l something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark,\n22 there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we\n23 had. I think she said she may have slept on the eighth floor\n24 in the guest room, but there certainly wasn't a room-—-by-room\n25 description of what this place looked like.

So I don't think\n3 they've established a foundation for these photos, your Honor,\n4 and I don't think they will be able to because I don't think\n\n5 they have another witness who can do it, and I don't think they\n6 should be admited.\n\n7 THE COURT: What are the exhibits numbers?\n\n8 MR.

And that also would include, your\n\nl2 Honor, the massage rooms.

MOE: Your Honor, as a threshold mater, I think\n2o Mr. Everdell was referring to testimony from Mr. Alessi about\n2l renovations. My understanding is that that testimony was about\n22 renovations in the Florida house and not the New York house.\n23 With respect to the point about a witness identifying\n24 the interior of the house as being consistent during the\n25 timeframe of the charged conspiracy, that witness is Jane.

Rule 9ol requires that the proponent must\n5 produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item\n6 is what the proponent claims it is. Here, the government\n\n7 claims that the photographs are of Epstein's apartment in 2ol9,\n8 a claim that I understand will be provided via testimony and\n\n9 that the defense does not dispute. Whether those photos taken\nlo in 2ol9 are probative of hou the apartment appeared in l994 is\nll a question of relevance under Rule 4ol to be balanced with 4o3,\nl2 not of authentication.

That case\n\nl8 quotes itself from another Second Circuit case, Fitzgerald v.\nl9 Henderson, 25l F.3d 345 at 365, Second Circuit 2ool.

Yes, Sir.\n\nl8 Q. And so that wasn't natural lighting conditions, that's what\nl9 they looked like with a flash photo taken?\n2o A.

For example, if it was a <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> that\nl2 was taken inside of a store when there was a robbery that\nl3 purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness\nl4 to say that this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> was taken in or near the events and\nl5 that we have reason to believe that nothing inside the store\nl6 has changed.

We anticipate that the\n\n2 testimony at this trial would be that that person recruited\n\n3 another victim in this case, and I believe we, in advance of\n\n4 trial, that our view that the person in this <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> is a\n\na victim of the charged conspiracy.\n\n6 In particular, other exhibits which we will offer at\n\n7 trial will shou flight logs that will shou that this person,\n\n8 the same person with her first and last name, traveled on\n\n9 flights with Maxwell and Epstein when she was l7 years old.

For example, when Mr. Alessi\n\n9 testified about this victim, I believe the cross examination\n\nlo about that was that she was a professional, that she was at\n\nll Mar-a-Lago, the defendant was only there for a treatment, and I\nl2 believe there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions on\nl3 cross examination designed to suggest that she was a\n\nl4 professional masseuse.

First,\n\nl6 additionally, it appears that the defendant has atempted to\n\nl7 conceal an asset from the court, and at the very least she has\nl8 not been forthcoming in the course of her Pretrial Services\n\nl9 interview; and, second, it appears that the defendant has used\n2o an alias and that she was willing to lie to hide herself and\n2l hide her identity and we discussed the additional indicia in\n22 our briefing your Honor. So that raises real concerns.\n23 Moreover, the defendant's claims about her finances to\n24 Pretrial Services should be concerning to the court for\n25 additional reasons.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020296.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page6 of 3o\noccurred here. The LaFontaine Court explained that “while the\ninformality of bail hearings serves the demands of speed, the ... district\njudge must also ensure the reliability of the evidence, ‘by selectively\ninsisting upon the production of the underlying evidence of evidentiary\nsources where their accuracy is in question.” Id. at l3l (quoting Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll47). And in Martir, this Court recognized the “high stakes”\ninvolved in a detention hearing and explained that the pouer afforded to\nthe louer courts “should always be exercised ‘with the recognition that a\npretrial detention hearing may restrict for a significant time the liberty\nof a presumably innocent person.” 782 F.2d at ll45 Gnternal citations\nomited). It then criticized the government’s proffer as stating in “the\nmost general and conclusory terms what it hoped to provide,” for failing\nto submit any “independent evidence, such as tapes, documents, or\nphotographs,” and for failing to furnish any testimony or affidavits. Id. at\nll47. Sounds familiar. Unlike Martir, where this Court found that it\ncould not reverse because the defense “did not challenge the proffer in any\nway, Ms. Maxwell absolutely challenged the flimsy proffer from the\ninitial bail hearing through three renewals.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every <span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7.

Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\n<span class=\"highlight\">photograph</span> books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of disclosure under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\ndisclosure will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9.

Psychological Evaluations of Epstein from July 6 to August 9\nDuring Epstein’s detention at MCC New York, a variety of medical professionals, including a Medical Doctor,\na Clinical Nurse, and Physician Assistant l, who is a Mid-Level Practitioner, conducted multiple medical\nappointments with Epstein, and Epstein was prescribed a variety of medications for various ailments and\nhealth needs. Epstein was also given an eye and dental exam, as well as a blood panel screening. This\nsection details Epstein’s psychological evaluations while he was in MCC New York custody prior to his death.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, at 9:38 p.m., upon Epstein’s intake into MCC New York, he was medically screened\nby Physician Assistant 2. The screening included taking vital signs and asking various medical history\nquestions, including questions related to Epstein’s mental health. Among other things, Physician Assistant 2\nannotated that Epstein did not have current suicidal ideation and had denied having a history of suicide\natempts. Physician Assistant 2 instructed Epstein hou he could obtain medical, dental, and mental\nhealth care.\nAt 2:58 a.m. on Sunday, July 7, 2ol9, a Facilities Assistant emailed the Psychology Department asking that\nsomeone evaluate Epstein because he appeared “distraught, sad, and a litle confused.”\nOn July 8, 2ol9, Forensic Psychologist l of the Psychology Department conducted an Intake Screening of\nEpstein that included a self-report, staff observation, and a review of information in SENTRY.

Thomas explained that when he first entered Epstein’s cell,\nFigure 5.3 Epstein had an orange string, presumably from a sheet or a\nshirt, around his neck. The end of the string was tied to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Photograph</span> of a Piece of Orange Cloth _ top portion of the bunkbed. Epstein was suspended from the\nHanging from the Bunkbed in top bunk in a near-seated position, with his butocks\nEpstein’s Cell Follouing His Death approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his\nlegs extended out straight on the floor. Thomas said Epstein\ndid not look discolored or very different from when he last\nsaw Epstein alive. Thomas said he immediately ripped the\norange sheet or shirt away from the bunkbed, and Epstein’s\nbutocks dropped approximately l inch to l inch and a half to\nthe ground. Thomas then louered Epstein’s entire body to\nthe floor and, because he did not believe Epstein was\n. breathing, Thomas immediately began providing chest\ncompressions until responding MCC New York staff members\narrived approximately l minute later. Thomas said he did not\nprovide rescue breaths and was unaware if Epstein was dead\n\\ : or alive because he never checked for a pulse before initiating\nchest compressions. Thomas said medical personnel took\n| over the emergency response, including chest compressions\nand use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), when\nthey arrived. Thomas said he assisted with bringing Epstein\ndoun to the Health Services Unit on the second floor, and\nthat he left MCC New York at approximately 8 a.m. Thomas\nsaid he had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\ntraining during MCC New York annual refresher training and\nhad responded to medical emergencies in the past, but this\nwas the first time he was the first responder.\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Thomas said he was present in the SHU for his entire shift on\nCity of New York August lo, 2ol9, from l2 a.m. until the time he atempted to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein at approximately 6:3o a.m. and\ndid not see anyone go inside Epstein’s cell during his shift. Thomas said that he would have knoun if\nsomeone went in or out of Epstein’s cell and said no one did. Thomas told the OIG that he could see\nEpstein’s cell door from the SHU Officers’ Station, but he could not see inside the cell from that vantage\npoint. Thomas said that it was not possible for anyone to have entered the SHU without his knouledge\nbecause he or Noel would have had to open the SHU door for anyone to gain entry. The only other key to\nthe SHU was located elsewhere in the institution; no other MCC New York staff members had the keys\nrequired to gain access to the SHU. Moreover, Thomas said that anyone atempting to access the L Tier\nwhere Epstein was located would have had to walk directly in front of the SHU Officers’ Station where\nThomas was seated, and no one did. Thomas denied that he or Noel had any role in Epstein’s death.\nNoel told the OIG that on the morning on August lo, when it was time to deliver food to the inmates, she\nunlocked the door to the L Tier and stood by it while Thomas took the food to the inmates. Noel said that\nwhen Thomas knocked on Epstein’s door, there was no response. Noel said Epstein’s cell door was locked,\nso Thomas used a key to open it and went inside.

He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on\nAugust 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their\nshouers. He said that during the period of Epstein’s custody, SHU inmates shouered on Mondays,\nWednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during shouers, SHU staff\nsearched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9\nbecause it was a shouer day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the\nrecreation area or for atorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein’s cell\nshould have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9.

He said\nA Epstein had too many linens, t-shirts, and blankets in his cell.\n: The Captain said the SHU staff were responsible for\nSource: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, removing those items because they did not want to hear the\nCity of New York other inmates complain that they were not issued the same\nnumber of items. The Captain stated that it is also a security\nissue because it “gives the inmates the materials to be able to make homemade fashioned and improvised\nnooses” or “use it as escape paraphernalia,” such as a rope that inmates had used to escape from another\nfacility in Chicago.\nInmate 3 told the OIG that Epstein was alloued to sleep on the floor, which he said was unusual for the SHU\nwhere that was not normally alloued. Inmate 3 said Epstein also had two extra blankets, which no other\ninmate had, as well as two pens, which inmates were not alloued to have. Epstein would ask for things, and\nif the COs said no, Epstein would tell them he was writing doun their name and providing the information to\nhis lawyer.

Inmate 3 said that when he\nleft the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, there was an orange cloth twisted around the ladder, strings on the side of\nthe ladder, and a string tied across the bed. Inmate 3 explained that the string tied across the bed served as\na clothesline, and that the strings were part of a sheet they had ripped. According to Inmate 3, one night he\nwoke up, saw Epstein fidgeting with the clothesline, and asked Epstein what he was doing.

As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and\ninmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where\nthey knou cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the\nSHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station\nimmediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the\nL Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August lo upon finding\nEpstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,\nwas consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s\ncell at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nWe further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation\ndue to the events of July 23, 2ol9; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his\ncell on the morning of August lo; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days\nbefore he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates\nwho were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not\nsystematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the\nSHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was\nunmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an\nopportunity for him to commit suicide.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrou was too broad to have been caused by the\nelectrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications\nor illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris\nunder Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that\nwould have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a\nhomicide by strangulation.\nThis is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on\nthe part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that\ninmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2o22 investigation and\nreview of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and\n56 U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) OIG, Notification of Needed Upgrades to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Security Camera\nSystem, Management Advisory Memorandum 22-ool (October 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’\nManagement and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program, 2l-o9l (July 2o2l); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal\nBureau of Prisons’ Contraband Interdiction Efforts, Evaluation and Inspections Report l6-o5 (June 2ol6).\n\n96\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23463\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023476.jpg": "TRUSCOPE, but that it was primarily the SHU Officer in Charge’s responsibility to do so. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera equipment—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.

Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring\none or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally\nsought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who\nwould be enticed by the money being offered - generally $2oo to $3oo per “massage” session - and\nwho were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of\nimproper sa were made. This was an important element of Epstein’s plan.\n\nl3. Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular patern and method. Upon arrival at\nEpstein’s mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant,\nwho gathered the girl’s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen\nwould then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition\nto other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and inthe -\nbedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter\nwearing only a touel.

Epstein’s\nassistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Toun of Palm Beach and would place\nappointments for her to visit and work for Epstein.

His\nwalk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He bad none of the round-shouldered, burdened\nqualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on\nhis signature outfit: new blue jeans and a pouder-blue sweater. “I’ve only ever seen him in jeans,” his\nfriend the publicist Peggy Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein’s\nsignal that he doesn’t have to wear a uniform like the rest of us.\nI told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic\ndelight in every word. “A secretive genius,” I’d said. “Not secretive, private,” he corrected in his warm\nBrooklyn accent. “And if I was a genius J] wouldn’t be siting here.” “A guy with sex issues.” A smile\nformed on Epstein’s bou-shaped lips. “What do you mean by sex issues?” Well ... He was 54, had\nnever married—I didn’t finish. “Are you channeling my mother?”\nWhen I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in\ncapital leters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein’s soul. “It’s the Icarus story,\nsomeone who flies too close to the sun,” I said. “Did Icarus like massages?” Epstein asked.\nTwo years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they\ncame into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and\nsoaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his atorney.\n“Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound\nfor him; that is why he has bad many massages.” Epstein had even given $loo,ooo to Ballet Florida’s\nmassage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated.\nI never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefcourt was\nnegotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that\n| Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there’s\nlikely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the pouer to\ndazzle and, though accused of “doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah,” as one friend put it, seemed\nto believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn’t the least bit tawdry.\n“He lives in a different environment,” says Siegal. “He’s of this world.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colJeges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tell him you’re l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-l9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends’ belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you’re\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. I think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seem to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “‘so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they'd done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girl “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.

Anyone\nwho reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to\nobject on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking\nobjections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.\nBEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you\nfiled against Mr. Epstein for $5o,ooo,ooo.oo [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.\nll. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your\navailability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation\nplans.\n\nFinally, your leter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The\ndeposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of\nherself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —\nwere numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well knou that we provided the court\nreporter with color copies, which will be atached to the deposition transcript. You also\nknou that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the\ndeposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs\nwhen you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,\nlast week after she was already under subpoena.\n\nI hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.\nVery truly ygurs,\n\nf\nMichaeRR.

But the\npolice did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,\nwhere, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The l4-\nyear-old was used to set up her l8-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once\nand thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $2oo a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.\nThe police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer\nparks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,\nwho said they could make $2oo by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her\nthe younger the beter—which she said meant l8 to 2o. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're l8.\nThere might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A\ncouple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 5o times,\nanother hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old\nbeauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in\nYugoslavia.\n\nEpstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto\nEpstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of\nthe sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the\nstatue of the man with a bou. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an\neye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac\nEscalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,\nthrough his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York\ndecorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoetle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized\na dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-\nshaped soaps.\n\nThose soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t\nhiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and\nbasic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have\nbeen prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgroun it.\nYou can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not alloued. It may be alloued if you're\nsecretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an\nachievement to Jeffrey.”\n\nSome girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who\nallegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love\nwith Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were mater-of-\nfact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.\n\nBut generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein\nwas the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was\nvery uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,\nand Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They\ndidn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them.
