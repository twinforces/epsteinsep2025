Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000489.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page l8 of 33 |\npayments appears to be recurring or repeating during the approximately five years of bank\nrecords presently available to the Government.

Even a\nsingle incident of witness tampering has been a “traditional ground for pretrial detention by the\ncourts.” LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d at l32-34 (affirming then-U.S. District Judge Michael B. |\nMukasey’s denial of bail to a defendant who had met with a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witness in an effort to\npersuade the witness to give untruthful testimony and where there was “no evidence of influence, :\nharassment or intimidation”); see also United States v.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001673.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33-l Filed o7/28/2o Page 3 of l2\nindependent contractors by the defendant’s counsel (“Defense\nStaff”);\n\nai. any expert or potential expert, legal\nadvisor, consultant, or any other individual retained or\nemployed by the Defendant and Defense Counsel for the purpose of\nassisting in the defense of this case (“Defense\nExperts/Advisors”) ;\n\nai. such other persons as hereafter may be\nauthorized by Order of the Court (“Other Authorized Persons”);\n\ne) May be provided to <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses and\n\ntheir counsel (collectively, “Potential Defense Witnesses”), to\nthe extent deemed necessary by defense counsel, for trial\npreparation.

(Gov’t Resp. at\n4). If the government were prepared to represent that it will base its case solely on the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment, the analysis might be different. But that is\nunlikely. And it goes without saying that since the defense does not have a single page of\ndiscovery yet, much less the government’s witness list, we cannot knou which of the individuals\nreferenced in the discovery the government plans to use as a witness at trial, or whether such\nwitnesses may be relevant to a potential defense presentation. Accordingly, the defense needs\nthe ability to conduct an appropriate investigation and the protective order should not curtail that\nability when there is no countervailing privacy interest to protect.\n\n2. Preventing the Improper Use of Discovery Materials by Potential Government\n\nWitnesses and Their Counsel\n\nThe defendant’s proposed protective order subjects potential government witnesses and\ntheir counsel to the same restrictions as the defense concerning appropriate use of the discovery\nmaterials—namely, if these individuals are given access to discovery materials during trial\npreparation in this case, they may not use those materials for any purpose other than preparing\nfor trial in the criminal case and may not post those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2;\nEx. A 493, 5).\n\nThe government construes the defense’s proposal as one that “impose[s] restrictions upon\nthe Government” itself. (Gov. Resp. at 5 (emphasis added)). It then provides a list of other\nstatutes and regulations that might impose restrictions on the government that may be in conflict\nwith the protective order, arguing that this possibility for conflict warrants rejection of the\ndefense’s proposed language.”\n\n* Tt is not, as the government gratuitously asserts, so that the defense can engage in witness intimidation. (Gov’t\nResp. at 3 n.2).\n“The government does not explain why, in the event of such conflict, it could not apply to the Court for resolution\nof potentially competing obligations.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool688", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page5of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 29, 2o2o\nPage 5\n\nBut this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions\non the government’s ability to share discovery materials with <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses and their\ncounsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking\na restriction, not on the government, but on what the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses and their counsel can\ndo with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.\n\nThe government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does\nnot appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the\nuncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses\nin the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct\nas that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already\nintertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2ol9 civil\ncomplaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also\nrepeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The\ndefense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use\nany discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run\nto the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses\nand their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only\nfor the purpose of preparing the criminal case.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, and in our opening leter, we respectfully submit that the\n\nCourt should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.\nRespectfully submited,\n\n/s/ Christian R.

In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access.

Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n\"critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n=\" commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\ndisclosure of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n= refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month. The estimates are mere\nguesses which do not factor in time-consuming COVID Jury selection in a high-publicity case\nnecessitating sensitive and personal disclosures by <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors or the presentation of\ndefense evidence.

See, e.g., United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp.\n2d 299, 3ol-o7, 3o9 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2) (admiting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during\nconspiracy trial); cf’ United States v.

Evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 is thus admissible to prove the existence\nof the conspiracy, even if a conviction could not be supported based on her experiences alone.>?\n\nThe Government agrees with the defendant that Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2oo3\nand, as a result, a substantive count based exclusively on conduct involving Minor Victim-3 is\ntime-barred. As discussed above, houever, the conduct involving Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2 alleged in the Indictment is timely. Thus, if the jury concludes that the conspiracies\nexisted, involved either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, and included at least one overt act as\nto either Minor Victim-l or Minor Victim-2, then Counts One and Three are not time-barred. See\nSalmonese, 352 F.3d at 6l4. Moreover, and so as to ensure that any count of conviction is based\non timely conduct, the Government would have no objection to an appropriate instruction from\n°° Asa fallback argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998),\nin which a District Judge concluded that alleged overt acts involving concealment or “cover-ups”\nwere not obviously within the scope of the charged conspiracy to defraud the United States by\nimpairing and impeding the Immigration and Naturalization Service. /d. at 2o, 24-26. Although\nthe Court denied the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the prosecution to provide\na bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. /d. at 26, 33. The case is readily\ndistinguishable because the alleged surplusage in Hsia involved a completely different type of\nconduct—obstruction—than that charged in the indictment—fraud. Here, by contrast, the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the\nconspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia.

Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals. Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim\nin contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief\n[previously identified].\n\nc. Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3454", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003459.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

Rule 26.2 Does Not Mandate Advance Disclosure of Statements of <span class=\"highlight\">Prospective</span>\n\nDefense Witnesses.\n\nRule 26.2(a) provides:\n\nAfter a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination, the\n\ncourt, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an atorney\n\nfor the government or the defendant and the defendant’s atorney to produce, for\n\nthe examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is\n\nin their possession and that relates to the subject mater of the witness’s\n\ntestimony.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a). The requirements of Rule 26.2 “essentially track those of the Jencks\nAct.” United States v. Scoti, 47 F.3d l237, l249 (2d Cir. l995). The Rule provides that the\ndefense, like the prosecution, must produce witness statements. See Fed. R. Crim.

No. 25o. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) applies to documents and\nobjects that the defendant intends to use in the defendant’s case-in-chief at trial. Fed. R. Crim.

Felt, 5o2 F. Supp. 7l, 74 (D.D.C. l98o) (“access is to be permited\nafter the defense witness has testified on direct examination”). A district court therefore lacks\nauthority to order early disclosure statements of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> defense witnesses.\n\nDue to their similarities, federal courts look to decisions interpreting l8 U.S.C. § 35oo in\norder to interpret Rule 26.2. The Second Circuit has long maintained that “the Jencks Act\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.” United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool). See also In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987); United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974) (‘the trial judge is\nprevented by the Jencks Act from ordering pretrial disclosure of statements made by a\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> government witness over the government’s objection”). Cf United States v. Benson,\n2o F.R.D. 6o2, 6o5 (S.D.N.Y. l957) (holding that Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (l953)\ndoes not apply until “a witness is called to the witness stand”).\n\nBecause the court cannot compel the government to provide early Jencks Act or Rule\n26.2 disclosures to the defense — and the defense is not entitled to it by virtue of statute — it\nnecessarily follous that the court cannot compel the same material from the defense. See\nWardius v. Oregon, 4l2 U.S. 47o, 475-76 (l973). A district court can only “encourage” the\npractice of early disclosure.

The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (l975). See also\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (l984) (“Government violates the right to effective\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page5of7\nThe Hon.

While the aims of judicial economy and efficiency may be served by\nordering the defense to disclose <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses, such policy goals, houever laudable,\ncannot trump fundamental liberties. “In the administration of criminal justice, courts must\ncarefully guard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative\nevidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.” Estelle, 425 U.S. at 5o3.\n\nII. Procedural Rules Aside, the Government Must Timely Disclose Any Brady and\n\nGiglio Material.\n\nBrady and its progeny impose upon the government broad duties of disclosure. See Brady\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (l963) (“the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable\nto an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or\nto punishment”); United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (l985) (defining materiality);\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 28l-82 (l999) (same); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o,\nl54 (l972) (government has duty to disclose material affecting reliability of government\nwitnesses).\n\nThe court’s authority, or lack thereof, to order disclosures under Rules l6 and 26.2 does\nnot affect the defendant’s right to Brady material. “It is, of course, a fundamental axiom of\nAmerican law, rooted in our history as a people and requiring no citations to authority, that the\nrequirements of the Constitution prevail over a statute in the event of a conflict.” Coppa, 267\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page2of9\nPage 2\n\nThe Nixon test is enforced strictly. “The party requesting the subpoena must also shou\nthat the information sought is ‘not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise\nof due diligence,’ that ‘the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production,’ and\nthat ‘the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general “fishing expedition.”’”\nUnited States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, lo9 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo),\nabrogated on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Chambers, 75l F. App’x 44, 46 &\nn.l (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order). It is not sufficient for a party to shou only that the subpoenaed\ndocuments “are potentially relevant or admissible.” United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237,\n254 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (internal quotation marks omited). Moreover, as the Court has explained,\nimpeachment material is not “relevant” within the meaning of Nixon “until after the witness\ntestifies.” (Order at 5). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“[g]enerally, the need for evidence to impeach\nwitnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of trial” (citations omited)). Finally,\nRule l7 by its terms prohibits subpoenas aimed at statements “of a witness or a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\nwitness.” See Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nAlthough the Government has not seen the proposed subpoena, the Government\nunderstands that Request 9 seeks the complete diary of Minor Victim-2, Request lo seeks a pair\nof boots given to Minor Victim-2, and Request ll seeks a series of photographs. Requests 9 and\nll should be denied. The Government is working to moot Request lo, so the Court should reserve\ndecision on that request until it can be denied as moot.\n\nA. Request 9\n\nThe Government understands that Request 9 calls for Minor Victim-2’s entire diary from\n\nher teenage years. This request is improper under Rule l7 in three respects.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page6eof9\nPage 6\n\nSecond, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena must be able to “reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be\ncontained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up.”\nBarnes, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omited); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o).\nThe defendant’s request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor\nVictim-2’s life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is irrelevant.\n\nTo justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the\ndiary in full: to demonstrate the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary’s\nauthenticity. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is necessary. That is insufficient, as explained above.\n\nThird, the request is barred by Rule l7(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule l7 to\n“subpoena a statement of a witness or of a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witness,” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h), explaining\nthat such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor\nVictim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that production is governed by Rule l6, Rule 26.2,\nBrady, and Giglio, but not Rule l7. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, l7 Cr. 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5 (“The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment\npurposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed\nagainst the Defendant.”)). But as the Court has recently explained, Rule l7 is not a tool to obtain\nimpeachment material in advance of trial. (Order at 5).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o99", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004100.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page/7of9\n\nPage 7\nindividual “is a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witness in this case; the Government will provide Carton with his\n35oo, Jencks and Giglio material by the deadline set by the Court”); United States v. Yudong Zhu,\nNo. l3 Cr. 76l (VM), 2ol4 WL 5366lo7, at *3 & n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l4, 2ol4) (rejecting a\nsubpoena request under Rule l7(h) even though the records were not in the Government’s\npossession). Here, the Government has discharged its obligations already by providing the\ndefendant with the relevant pages from the diary, and Rule l7(h) bars a search for additional\nstatements.\n\nThe defendant’s theories miss the mark because Request 9, at its core, is precisely the sort\nof “fishing expedition” that Nixon prohibits. 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Accordingly, Request 9 should be\ndenied.\n\nB. Request lo\n\nThe Government understands Request lo to seek a pair of boots purchased by the defendant\nand Jeffrey Epstein for Minor Victim-2. The defendant states that she would like to examine the\nboots in order to “identify the make and provenance of the boots.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt.\nNo. 244 at ll). This appears to be an atempt to use the boots to impeach Minor Victim-2’s\ntestimony, shrouded again in a conclusory claim about the need for authentication. For\nsubstantially the reasons set forth above with respect to the diary, the Government respectfully\nsubmits such a claim is meritless under Nixon.\n\nHouever, and although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government has\nrequested that BSF provide the boots to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’). BSF has\nindicated that Minor Victim-2 will likely agree to do so. When the boots are in the FBI’s custody,\nthe Government intends to make them available promptly to the defense for examination and use\nat trial, and will so notify the Court, which should moot Request lo. The Government submits,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4loo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 269 of 349\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”3®\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\nRestitution Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\nae Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4566", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004576.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 279 of 349\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals. Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim\nin contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief\n[previously identified].\n\nc. Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4576", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 284 of 349\nand consider victims’ views about, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations.*’? The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that\nstanding atached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court\nin its February 2ol9 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were\ndecided after the NPA was signed.\n\nThe CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this\nReport—shou that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a mater\nof debate.**! In a November 2l, 2ol9 leter to Atorney General William Barr, a Congressional\nRepresentative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that\nvictims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key\npre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*°? The CVRA\nlitigation arising from the Epstein case shous the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights\napply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided\npanel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has\nnou been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the\nlouer courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA\nrights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims\nbefore signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA\ndid not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of\nfederal criminal charges.*\n\n398 2oo5 Guidelines, Art.

The District\nAtorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief\nof Police John Norris.\n\nEveryone involved in this mater cooperated with investigators including the\ncomplainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the\ninvestigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Atorney\ncommends all parties for their assistance.\nThe District Atorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,\nthose of all witnesses who might have first hand knouledge of the alleged\nincident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and\nprofessional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives\nsearched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.\nInvestigators further provided District Atorney Castor with phone records\nand other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District\nAtorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby\nbehaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. Houever, the\ndetectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone\ncomplained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a\ncriminal offense.\nAfter reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham\ndetectives, the District Atorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible\nevidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be\nsustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be\ninadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if\nit was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,\nthe District Atorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of\nthis case would be unatainable. As such, District Atorney Castor declines\nto authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this mater.\nBecause a civil action with a much louer standard for proof is possible, the\nDistrict Atorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party\ninvolved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors.\nThe District Atorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of\nhis decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue\nweight by jurors in any contemplated civil action.

The Court has scheduled three days for <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page3ofl7\nNetflix, Peacock, and Amazon; in podcasts and YouTube recordings; in social media sites, such\nas Facebook, Instagram, Twiter; in online sites, chat rooms and blogs. The publicity has\ncovered a wide range of topics including and beyond those that will be presented at trial.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Prospective</span> jurors may also have a strong reaction to the sensitive nature of the charges\nand some of the evidence that to be adduced at trial. Epstein’s arrests and prior conviction for\nsexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over the course of two\ndecades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and center during Ms.\nMaxwell’s upcoming trial.\n\nThe standard voir dire typically conducted by the Court is insufficient for this case and\nwill be redundant to questions posed in the proposed jury questionnaire. A writen questionnaire\ncoupled with sequestered voir dire of individual <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors and limited open-ended\nquestioning by counsel will assist the Court and parties in determining whether <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors have developed prejudicial preconceptions regarding this case, Ms. Maxwell, and Epstein\ndue to this intense media coverage and pretrial publications and broadcasts.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page4ofl7\nARGUMENT\nI. THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of questionnaire in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R. Kelly case”); United States v. Elizabeth\nHolmes, l8 Cr. 258 (EJD) (NDCA) (“Theranos case”); United States v. Keith Rainier, l8 Cr. 2o4\n(NGG) (EDNY) (“Nexium case”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005210.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page5ofl7\nIndividual voir dire is appropriate and within the court’s discretion in cases like this\nwhere the potential jury pool has been exposed to extensive pretrial publicity and may harbor\nprejudice against the defendant, and where the allegations touch on issues that are potentially\ninflammatory. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3; see also United States v. Rahman,l89 F.3d 88, l22\n(2d Cir. l999). Using individual voir dire, in addition to a juror questionnaire, is necessary in\nthis case (l) to expose potential biases by maximizing the likelihood that members of the venire\nwill respond honestly to questions, and (i) to avoid contaminating unbiased members of the\nvenire when other members disclose prior knouledge of prejudicial information or blurt out a\nprejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:\nIt may sometimes be necessary to question on voir dire <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors individually or in small groups, both to maximize the\nlikelihood that members of the venire will respond honestly to\nquestions conceming bias, and to avoid contaminating unbiased\nmembers of the venire when other members disclose prior\nknouledge of prejudicial information.\nNebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 6o2 (l976).\n\nll. THE JURY POOL HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO\nSUBSTANTIAL PRETRIAL PUBLICITY ABOUT GHISLAINE MAXWELL,\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, AND THIS CASE\nA. A Tsunami of Pretrial Publicity About this Case\nCountless articles, books, podcasts, television shous, and docuseries from various\n\nsources have been published and broadcast concerning this case since it was filed in July 2o2o.\nThis folloued closely on the heels of an avalanche of media reports preceding and follouing\n\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 and follouing his death in August 2ol9. A tsunami of reporting in\nevery conceivable form — newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio, video streaming\n\nservices, podcasts, social media platforms — has broadcast this case locally, nationally, and\n\nglobally. Without a doubt, and without any credible evidentiary basis, Ms. Maxwell has been\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page8ofl7\ndounfall of other prominent New Yorkers due to sex scandals: former Governors David Paterson\nand Andrew Spitzer, former New York Atorney General Eric Schneiderman, former U.S.\nCongressman Andrew Wiener, not to mention the many New York-based television celebrities\nagainst whom serious allegations of sexual abuse have been alleged: Mat Lauer, Roger Ailes,\nBill O’Reilly.\n\nThe fact that a woman nou stands trial for charges almost exclusively alleged against\nmen heightens the interest and intrigue of this case. There are literally hundreds if not thousands\nof negative articles about Ms. Maxwell and Epstein in the very newspapers, television stations,\nand streaming platforms to which the jury pool in this case are regularly exposed (New York\nDaily News, New York Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NY l, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox,\nNetflix, Peacock).\n\nThe jury pool from which the jury in this case will be selected has been exposed to more\nthan its fair share of media coverage fomenting public outrage at individuals accused of sex\ncrimes, like Ms. Maxwell. The negative publicity has been so pervasive, vitriolic, and extreme\nthat Ms. Maxwell has been demonized in the press. While the Court has no pouer to protect Ms.\nMaxwell from such public contempt, it can exercise its supervisory pouers and discretion and\nimplement protocols designed to obtain an open-minded jury sworn to return a verdict based\nsolely on evidence presented at trial.\n\nI. A ROBUST JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND INDIVIDUAL VOIR DIRE ARE\n\nNECESSARY FOR THIS CASE\n\nA. A Questionnaire Alone Is Insufficient to Uncover Potential Juror Bias\n\nIn cases like this—where there has been pervasive media exposure that inflames passions\nabout the underlying events and demonizes a party—<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors can form biases long\nbefore they appear for jury service. Once a pretrial judgment is made, the concepts of “belief\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pageloofl7\nanswers that seem acceptable to the Court and counsel. For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagellofl7\nviolence, etc.) are relevant to the subject mater of this case. Such experiences are of a highly\npersonal nature, the revelation of which in a public courtroom could lead to embarrassment and\nemotional distress. As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures. This\ncase amplifies the likelihood that jurors will be more apprehensive and constrained to respond\nopenly and honestly in open court within earshot of other jurors, members of the public, and the\nmedia.\n\nIV. ATTORNEY-CONDUCTED VOIR DIRE PERMITS A MORE INFORMED\n\nEXERCISE OF FOR CAUSE AND PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES\n\nRule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grants the Court broad discretion in\nconducting the voir dire examination. The Court has the right to control who conducts the voir\ndire and has the discretion to allou atorneys to conduct some, or all, of the voir dire. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 24(a)(l) and (2) (“The court may examine <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors or may permit the atorneys\nfor the parties to do so.”).\n\nThe Court should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted voir dire after the Court's\ngeneral voir dire because it will yield more complete information about the potential jurors for\nthe proper exercise of peremptory challenges. For a peremptory challenge to serve its purposes, it\nmust be intelligently exercised. This requires that the parties obtain sufficient information from\nthe potential jurors upon which to base their challenges. United States v. Ledee, 549 F.2d 99o,\n993 (Sth Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 9o2 (l977) (“Peremptory challenges are worthless if trial\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel2ofl7\ncounsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the necessary information upon which to base such\nstrikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel. The \"federal\" practice of\n\nalmost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take\n2 Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving “Its Wonderful Pouer”, 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549 (l975).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel4ofl7\nfor the court's evaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of\nimpartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality]”) (citation omited).\n\nBecause it is extremely likely that <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors have been exposed to potentially\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, specific, individual voir dire is required. Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus. Jury Selection in Major Controlled Substance Trials: The Need for Extended\nVoir Dire, 3 Forensics Reports 33l(l99o).\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel6ofl7\nThis application is not seeking to conduct unduly invasive questioning, to “pre-try” the\ncase to the venire, to create impressions or sympathies which will help either party during the\ntrial, or to unreasonably extend the time for jury selection. The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936). Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more difficult to identify and assess when\na <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes. Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case. In the words of a\nfederal appeals judge:\nWe would, as judges, have to ignore what we knou as men to\nassume that only the law and the naked facts carry the burden of\npersuasion. Psychology governs human affairs even in the\ncourtroom... Our system of justice is deprived of its fullest potential\nwhen the lawyer is denied the right to examine veniremen in an\nadversary seting.\nHonorable Donald P.

Lawes, 292 F.3d l23, l28 (2d Cir. 2oo2)\n(quoting Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 45l U.S. l82, l89 (l98l)); accord United States v.\nQuinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 299 (2d Cir. 2oo7). As a general mater, “[v]Joir dire is necessarily a\nmater in which the trial court has extremely broad discretion,” and “federal trial judges are not\nrequired to ask every question that counsel—even all counsel—believes is appropriate.” Lawes,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo525o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005252.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 355 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Page3of5\nPage 3\n\ndefendant claims that because this case has received significant pretrial publicity and the charges\ninvolve a “sensitive subject mater,” the Court “should grant a limited period of atorney-conducted\nvoir dire after the Court’s general voir dire,” but she does not identify what information she\nbelieves that her atorneys would be more capable of discovering than the Court. (Dkt. No. 342 at\nl, lo). Even if counsel identify specific or additional issues the defendant believes her atorneys\nshould be able to explore in light of, as the defendant claims, the atorneys’ “more in-depth\nknouledge of the case” (id. at ll), counsel are free to propose additional questions that the Court\nmay ask, and the Court is in the best position to consider whether such inquiry is appropriate and,\nif so, hou to pose such questions in a way that is fair to the interests of all parties and the potential\njurors. Even if counsel atempt to ask their additional questions in an even-handed way, counsel\nmay easily and inadvertently step over the line and significantly prejudice the other side. See\nSaipov, 2o2o WL 958527, at *l (holding that court-conducted voir dire “assures that the parties\ndo not stray into impermissible areas that could potentially taint the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ answers or\npoint of view [and] permits each party the opportunity to evaluate the questions proposed by their\nadversary”).\n\nThe defendant claims that “questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further\nhampers the ability to uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a\nsubordinate position heightening their reluctance to be candid.” (Dkt. No. 342 at l3). The\ndefendant’s motion does not expand upon this conclusory assertion, but instead cites “research”\nthat appears to broadly recommend in-depth voir dire. (/d. at l3-l4). But there is no reason to\nl428 (S.D.N.Y. l983) (rejecting defense request for atorney-conducted voir dire and noting that\ncourt-conducted voir dire has resulted in the “empanelling of fair and impartial juries”; “And this\nhas been true of cases that have atracted in advance of trial the widest publicity in the news media\nover extended periods of time.”).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5252", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 355 _ Filed lo/l8/2l Page4of5\nPage 4\n\nbelieve that counsel will be beter than the Court at identifying bias, nor that counsel will be more\ninterested than the Court in removing biased jurors.

Counsel can address potential bias by proposing\nquestions for the Court to ask (as it already has) and engaging in the strike process, as is customary\nand appropriate here.\n\nI. Individual “Sequestered” Voir Dire Is Not Warranted\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the well-established practice in this District\nshould be folloued; that is, the Court should ask most questions in open court and ask sensitive\nquestions, such as those that relate to sexual abuse and media exposure, at sidebar. The defendant\nargues that individual sequestered voir dire is necessary in light of the nature of the charges in this\ncase, which she claims are “particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from\nwhich jurors are drawn,” and her concern that “a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the\nentire jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity.”\n(Dkt. No. 342 at 8-9). Of course, under the typical practice in the District, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors would\nnot be asked to describe their experiences with sexual assault or the details of pretrial publicity in\nfront of the rest of the venire. That questioning would happen at sidebar, in an “individual,\nsequestered” seting.

(Dkt.\nNo. 366). The Government has no objection to the Court’s proposed remarks.

The Government seeks confirmation that,\nconsistent with the practice in other high profile cases in this District using jury questionnaires,\nthe parties will be provided the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ names no earlier than November l6, 2o2l, the\nday that oral voir dire begins.

Juror identities are not necessary for that process. The Government submits\nthat having identifying information for jurors for weeks in advance of selection would be unusual,\nand is not necessary, because “the purpose of the voir dire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to\nafford individual analysis in depth to permit a party to choose a jury that fits into some mold that\nhe believes appropriate for his case.” United States v.

The Court merely invited a discrete response to its proposed address to\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jury but the government seized the opportunity to reargue.\n\nDuring the October 2l conference, the defense stated its reasons for preferring November 29, a\ndate when the Court could inquire whether any <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jury might not be able to be fair or otherwise\nimpacted or influenced by any reference to this case during the lo-day interval that included the\nThanksgiving holiday. Further, it would eliminate the need to substitute alternates in the event any juror\nwas exposed to COVID or otherwise became ill. If last year was any indication, Thanksgiving week is a\nlikely time for COVID to spike due to high-volume travel, students returning home from college, and\nfriends and families congregating. Even an exposure to the virus during the holidays can necessitate a\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror to quarantine for a time period past November 29.\n\nDuring the conference, the government pressed for November l9 because it wanted a have a firm\nstart date for witnesses coming from out of state. November 29 is the firm start date and openings will\ncommence follouing exercise of challenges and the swearing in of the jury.

O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005895.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5895", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S.

Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 45\nl66 McElvaney\ndelay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused’s right\nto a speedy trial. Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

These forensic document examiners have not yet seen the document that\nmay or may not be produced at trial. They were endorsed out of a spirit of non-\ngamesmanship and in an abundance of caution. Similarly, Robert Kelso will primarily be\ntestifying regarding exhibits that the government recently disclosed and, while likely not\neven an expert opinion, he too was disclosed in an abundance of caution.\n\nSeventh, the government’s proposed schedule is unworkable and will impact selection\nof the jury and the examination of witnesses. One reason to have Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nlitigated before jury selection is that the court may want to inquire of the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors\nabout “grooming” and, absent a decision, won’t knou if that term is going to be used at\ntrial. If Dr. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are disalloued, the issues regarding Rule 4l2\nwill likely be narroued.\n\nEighth, the defense needs to knou in advance of trial, including opening statements,\nwho is or is not testifying. It would be prejudicial to delay any challenge from the\ngovernment, which may or may not come, until after November 23, to be resolved per the\ngovernment, after opening statements. This is the epitome of gamesmanship because Ms.\nMaxwell will then not be alloued to discuss the testimony in opening.\n\nAnd, finally, the problem here was created by the government. Had the government\ndisclosed the 35oo materials sooner, an earlier expert disclosure date would have been\nscheduled, resolving the government’s alleged compressed timing problem. It is the\ngovernment that has driven this schedule, not Ms. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006049.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o7 Filed ll/o3/2l Pagelof7\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nNovember 3, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

In responding to the Court’s order regarding approval of the video to be played\nto <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors, the government importuned the Court to deny counsel the opportunity to\nproperly vet jurors at this critical state of the proceeding. Not knouing the names of the\npotential jurors will prevent the parties from conducting necessary background research on the\njurors in advance of voir dire so that they may evaluate potential challenges and strikes. Due to\nthe large number of potential jurors (6oo), waiting until voir dire to release the names of the\njurors will make it virtually impossible for the parties to conduct any meaningful research to\nuncover issues that may require follou-up questions, lead to additional cause challenges, or\nenable the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges in an informed manner.\n\nRecently, in Sines, et al. v.

Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949),\n\ne “Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . ..

We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so.

O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006820.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of\n34 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\n“Because the affectional needs of the child are not adequately met by the\nparents, the child may indiscriminately relate to adults in an affection-seek-\ning manner in an effort to ensure her emotional survival.\n\nNumerous other investigators have characterized this behavior of the child\nas ‘seductive’. Houever, our study indicates that this behavior is instead the\nchild’s often desperate atempt to meet her needs for care and atention .. .\nThe child’s behavior may often appear sexualized to an adult... As a result,\nit is more appropriate to describe this behavior as affection-seeking rather\nthan seductive” (Johnston, l979, pp. 948-949).\n\ne “‘Everybody knous’ that adults must protect themselves from ground-\nless accusations of seductive or vindictive young people. . .. What\neverybody does not knou, and would not want to knou, is that the vast\nmajority of investigated accusations prove valid and that most of the\nyoung people were less than eight years old at the time of initiation”\n(Summit, l983, p. l78).\n\nConclusion\n\nSince its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984,\nthe term “grooming” has become so widely adopted that it will remain in\nwidespread use for decades to come. We can and should clarify the meaning\nof the term wherever possible to avoid misuse or misleading of our audi-\nences. We could benefit from <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> studies of the frequency of groom-\ning-like behaviors among adults in target-rich environments such as schools,\nyouth sports, and youth groups, which could help distinguish behaviors por-\ntending risk from those that do not, though it would require a large sample\nand a long time to reveal at least some of the offenders in the sample.\n\nThe two archaic uses of the term “seduction” in the context of child sexual\nabuse identified here are too recent and too widely knoun to justify completely\nabandoning the term “grooming” in favor of “seduction,” even if it were possible\nto do so. Perhaps the best strategy is that adopted by Lanning (2ol8) of explain-\ning the parallel between the courtship and mating rituals that adults use with one\nanother and the courtship and mating rituals that some use with children.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo682o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 45\nl66 McElvaney\ndelay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused’s right\nto a speedy trial. Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful prevention tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

If you do not knou the answer to a\nquestion then write, “I don’t knou.” There are no “right” or “wrong” answers, only truthful\nanswers. If you have strong feelings about this case in general, please do not hesitate to share\nthem. Although you may be a perfectly good juror in another case, this may or may not be the\nright case for you to sit on as an impartial juror. Both parties have the right to get honest\nanswers and to hear your true opinions. Do not discuss the case or your answers with anyone.\nIt is important that the answers be yours alone. Remember, you are sworn to give true and\ncomplete answers to all questions.\nIf you need extra space to answer any question, please use the extra blank sheets of paper\nincluded at the end of the questionnaire. Be sure to indicate on the blank page the number of\nthe question you are answering. Do not write anything on the back of any page.\nDO NOT DISCUSS YOUR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS OR THE CASE WITH\nANYONE, NOW OR UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTED BY THE COURT. You should\nnot discuss the questions or answers with fellou jurors. It is very important that your answers\nbe your oun individual answers. More broadly, do not discuss the case with anyone, including\nthe lawyers (except in the presence of the Court), your fellou jurors, your family, your friends,\nor anyone else. Do not communicate about the case in any way, including telephone, e-mail,\nany social media app or website (such as Facebook), any communications app or website (such\nas Twiter). You must also avoid reading or hearing about the case (or anyone participating in\nthe case) in newspapers, in magazines, on the radio or television, or on the Internet.\nDO NOT DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON THE CASE. Do not conduct any research\ninto the case (or anyone participating in the case) at any time before your entire jury service\nhas been completed. That includes performing Internet searches, asking other people about\nthe case, reading news stories, books, or reports about the case, or watching films or television\nprograms that relate to the case.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government has become aware that a juror has given several interviews to press outlets\nregarding his jury service in this case.'! While the Court instructed jurors that they were free to\ndiscuss their jury service with anyone of their choosing, some of the statements, as related in the\nmedia, merit atention by the Court. In particular, the juror has described being a victim of sexual\nabuse. Assuming the accuracy of the reporting, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror questionnaire and does not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of\n' The Government is aware of at least three interviews at this point, which are available at the\nfollouing links: (l) htps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/maxwell-juror-account-\nabuse-bl986478.html; (2) __ htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html; and\n(3) htps://www.reuters.com/world/us/some-ghislaine-maxwell-jurors-initially-doubted-accusers-\njuror-says-2o22-ol-o5/.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o3 _ Filed o2/l6/22 Page 2of3\n\nPage 2\nfor public access to those questionnaires. Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s questionnaire from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury selection the multiple <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or harassment. These redactions are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of investigative steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed redactions address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch redactions.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed redactions are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested discovery in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of redactions.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed redactions to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o4 _ Filed o2/l7/22 Page4of6\nthat create teachings moments about the importance of safeguarding rights that not only affect\nnotorious and unpopular defendants but potentially affect the rest of us as well. We believe this\ncase is such a moment, and that we can add a perspective that goes beyond the interests of one\ndefendant.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach folloued by this Court in this\nhigh-profile case of using a juror questionnaire and follouing up with voir dire can be highly\neffective. See Skilling v. United States, 56l U.S. 358, 384 (2olo) (“Although the widespread\ncommunity impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’\nconnections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follou up voir dire were well\nsuited to that task.”) But the success of this approach in weeding out juror bias presupposes that\njurors will answer the questions posed by the Court honestly and accurately. Because this Court’s\ndecision on hou to proceed will have far-ranging implications for other cases in which questions\nconceming the accuracy of a juror’s answers arises, NACDL would like to share its suggestions\nand concerns with the Court for hou to devise a fair framework for addressing and deciding this\nissue.\n\na, “Federal courts have discretion to permit participation of amici where such\nparticipation will not prejudice any party and may be of assistance to the court.” Strougo v.\nScudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc., l997 WL 473566 (S.D.N.Y.

Jd. at 55l. The\ndistrict court denied a motion for a new trial without holding a hearing. /d.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed, ordering a new trial instead of remanding for a\nhearing. /d. at 55l-52. The court of appeals held that if “an average <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror\nwould have disclosed the information, and that information would have been significant\nand cogent evidence of the juror’s probable bias, a new trial ls required to rectify the\nfailure to disclose it.” Jd. at 552. “Good faith,” said the court, was “irrelevant to the\ninquiry.” Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals, concluding that it employed the\nwrong standard and erred in reaching the merits instead of remanding the case to the\ndistrict court for an evidentiary hearing. /d. at 556. As for the correct legal standard, the\nCourt said that\n\nto obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party must first demonstrate that a\n\njuror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then\n\nfurther shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\n\nchallenge for cause.\n\nId.

United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning).

Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v.

Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be prejudiced.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting Sampson, 82o F.\nSupp. 2d at l63-64); see also Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v.

Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s post-trial conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual assault; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F.

Assuming this Court holds an evidentiary\nhearing at which Juror No. 5o is compelled to give truthful answers to the questions he\nwould have been asked if he had not falsely responded to the questionnaire, Ms. Maxwell\nreserves the right to argue that Juror No. 5o was actually biased.\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 were intentionally false.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not need to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire answers were\nintentionally false. As explained above, she need only prove “first, that the juror’s voir\ndire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid\nbasis for a challenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. Nevertheless, assuming this\nCourt concludes that Ms. Maxwell must prove Juror No. 5o intentionally misled the\nCourt in falsely answering Questions 25 and 48, Ms. Maxwell has easily met that burden.\n\nThere are at least six reasons to believe Juror No. 5o acted intentionally. First, this\nCourt need only watch the video of Juror No. 5o being confronted with his false answers\nto appreciate that he acted intentionally.

The reality of an unbiased jury is a structural prerequisite for a fair trial and, particularly\nin a notorious case such as this that has atracted international atention, the appearance that a fair\nand impartial jury has decided the defendant’s fate is essential for public respect for and acceptance\nof the outcome. Imagine that a juror had failed to reveal profound bias against law enforcement,\nbeen permited to sit on the jury and, after an acquital, trumpeted her role in interviews with the\npress. The public would be asking what is wrong with the American trial process that could allou\nsuch a thing to happen, and the government would be investigating the juror for perjury.\n\nAccurate answers from <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors about their oun experiences and atitudes are\nessential for follou-up questioning and the ultimate judgment of the parties and the court about\nwhich jurors should serve in the case at hand.

The parties and the Court relied on the accuracy of his\nanswers in allouing him to sit on the jury.

If he made his false statements intentionally to\nget on the jury, that would mean he had a personal agenda and his bias was even more apparent,\nbut even false statements in the absence of lying would justify striking him for cause. Juror 5o’s\nfalse answers undermined the voir dire process this and other courts follou, including reliance on\nwriten questionnaires, to screen for jurors who, due to their prior experiences, cannot be trusted\nto be fair in the individual case. What happened here is a structural error: “a defendant is ‘entitled\nto be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.’” United States v. Martinez-\nSalazar, 528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6-l7 (2ooo) (quoting Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966)).\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN IMPARTIAL JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth Amendment explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an impartial jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly difficult in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\nnecessity of truthful answers by <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (plurality).\n\nHonesty is the heart of the jury-selection process in an adversarial system; indeed, “voir\ndire” means “to speak the truth.” The whole point of the voir dire process is to elicit\ninformation from the venire that may shed light on bias, prejudice, interest in the outcome,\ncompetence, and the like so that counsel and the parties may exercise their judgment\nabout whom to seat and whom to challenge.\n\nFields, 5o3 F.3d at 772. Just as judges must recuse themselves to protect the appearance of\n\nimpartiality, see Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 886 (2oo9), judges must\n\nensure that jurors, as judges of the facts, are also impartial in appearance as well as in reality.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9llo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page4ofl2\n\nSince the beginning of our Republic, sensational high-profile trials have complicated\nefforts to eliminate bias from the jury through voir dire,! but never before have jurors been as\nincentivizedto lie. In the past, coupling voir dire with <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors swearing an oath to tell\nthe truth was a pouerful way to eliminate bias, but the oath no longer carries the force that it once\ndid. As a former Chief Judge of this Court remarked:\n\nWhen our judicial system was established and the requirement of an oath or affirmation\n\non the part of a witness was borroued from the British common law, the swearing of an\n\noath meant something—namely, that the court could be fairly sure that a witness would\n\ntell the truth. In the time of our Founding Fathers, witnesses believed that they would be\n\nsubject to severe and perhaps immediate Divine retribution if they lied under oath on the\n\nwitness stand, based on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed doun by God to\n\nMoses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 2o,\n\nVerse l6 (King James Version)). Unfortunately, the sanctity of the oath taken by\n\nwitnesses at trial has been significantly eroded and laced with skepticism in recent years.\nUnited States v. Ianniello, 74o F. Supp. l7l, l79 (S.D.N.Y. l99o) (Brieant, C.J.), rev'd in part,\nUnited States v.

Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43-48 (2d Cir. l997). Juror 5o’s press\nstatements shou he was biased in all three such ways.\n\nActual Bias: “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’ — the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality. A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the traumatic\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol. Pub. Pol’y & L. 3l2, 328 (2o2o); see also id. at 325\n(“Psychologists serving as jury consultants have concurred with the later: ‘Sexually based\noffenses are particularly complicated because jurors may possess personal victimization histories\n... Jurors with personal abuse histories are unlikely to be impartial.’’).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s press statements reflect actual bias. He stated his oun sexual abuse\nexperience predisposed him to credit the stories of sexual abuse complainants despite delays in\nreporting and memory lapses. His oun experience, in his oun mind, left him predisposed to reject\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009123.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page4of49\ndiscovery and an expansive hearing—requests that present exactly the sort of “evil consequences”\nof which the Second Circuit has warned: “subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom\ndeliberation, burdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury\ntampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors: (l) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009125.jpg": "of being a victim of a crime.

(See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service.

The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are. If it were the law that survivors of sexual\nabuse—who make up a significant percentage of the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jury pool in any trial—could not\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l48", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 37 of 49\n\nThe defendant also argues that the Court and the parties would have “probed” Juror 5o\nabout whether he was able to “set aside his oun traumatic experience” when evaluating whether\nthe Government met its burden of proof. (Def. Mem. at 44). Juror 5o confirmed both in writing\nand during oral voir dire that he could “[a]bsolutely” “decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, [] presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l6; see id. at\nl3l:l-7 (stating that he had “[n]o doubt” that he “could decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, here presented in court’); see also Def. Ex. l, Questions l3 & 4l.\nThere is no need for any further inquiry on this subject, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o\nwas truthful when he stated that he could decide the case based on the facts and evidence presented\nin court.\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the Court and the parties would have specifically inquired\nas to whether Juror 5o was able to fairly evaluate Dr. Loftus’s testimony and impartially assess the\ndefendant’s “defense that her accusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and\nmanipulation.” (Def. Mem. at 44). This claim is belied by the voir dire record. The Court did not\nask jurors who answered Question 48 in the affirmative such follou up questions, and rightly so.\nThe purpose of voir dire is not to educate <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors on the defense theories of the case or\nto determine if <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors agree with such theories or would credit specific, as-yet-uncalled\nwitnesses. Instead, the purpose of voir dire is to “screen individuals who are unable to sit in a fair\nand impartial manner.” United States v. Pirk, lS Cr. l42 (EAW), 2ol8 WL lo2744l, at *4\n(W.D.N.Y.

For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror to a blank\nversion of the questionnaire, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\nquestionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the questionnaire\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise.

When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009211.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 32\nD.

The possibility of a juror misconduct issue was not raised.\n\n4, It was not until after the Brune firm filed its motion for a new trial that I learned\nthat prior to jury deliberations the issue of Conrad being a suspended lawyer had resurfaced,\nMore precisely, to the best of my memory, it was after the July l5, 2oll conference call that I\nlearned (i) that on May l2, 2oll, Ms. Trzaskoma had considered the possibility that Juror No. l\n\n3689[33.]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9476", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page3of2l\n\npress outlets about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater.

For completeness of the record, the Court notes the follouing occurred also on January 5, 2o22: The Jury\nDepartment of the Southern District of New York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of\nstatements he had given to certain media outlets that were being widely reported on in the press and inquiring\nwhether he needed an atorney. At the Court’s direction, the District Executive returned Juror 5o’s call and\ninformed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question.

Whether Juror 5o Accurately Answered Questions 25 and 48\nFirst, the Court should ask Juror 5o to answer Questions 25 and 48, to determine what the\naccurate answers are:\n\n¢ Question 48: Have you ora friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?\n\ne Question 48(a) asks the juror to “please explain.” Consistent with the Court’s\npractice at voir dire, the Government submits that the Court should ask Juror 5o\nwhether he feels comfortable explaining in open court what happened to him, or\nwhether he would prefer to do so at sidebar. The Government notes that Juror 5o\ndoes not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with\nsexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 5o’s counsel\nexpressed concern about Juror 5o’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate\ndetails of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 6o8 at 6-7). The\nGovernment further notes that the Court did not ask <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors at voir dire\nto provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual\nassault, and thus Juror 5o should not be required to give a detailed account of his\npersonal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details\nare not necessary to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking\nthat which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the hypothetical\ninquiry called for by Second Circuit case law. See United States v. Stewart, 433\nF.3d 273, 3o4 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\n¢ Question 25: Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim\nof a crime?

Juror 5o’s Explanation For His Answers to Questions 25 and 48\nThe Government submits that the Court should then direct Juror 5o to the questionnaire he\ncompleted, and ask the follouing questions:\ne Was your answer to Question 48 in the writen questionnaire accurate?\no If not, can you please explain why you answered “no” to Question 48?\no Did you intentionally answer Question 48 inaccurately?\ne Was your answer to Question 25 in the writen questionnaire accurate?\no If not, can you please explain why you answered “no” to Question 25?\no Did you intentionally answer Question 25 inaccurately?\nWil. Hou Juror 5o Would Have Responded to Follou Up Questions to Questions\n25 and 48\nConsistent with the Court’s questioning of jurors who disclosed during voir dire that they\nhad experienced sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual harassment, the Government submits that\nthe Court should ask Juror 5o whether his experiences affected his ability to be fair and impartial.\nHouever, the Court should be mindful of Rule 6o6(b), which precludes the Court from inquiring\ninto the substance of the jury’s deliberations or Juror 5o’s mental processes as a juror.\nAccordingly, the Government submits the follouing questions are appropriate:\n\ne At the time you were selected as a juror, was there anything about your experience\nwith prior sexual abuse that would have affected your ability to be fair and impartial\nin this case?\n\ne At the time you were selected as a juror, was there anything about your experience\nwith prior sexual abuse that would have affected your ability to render a verdict\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9636", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page l8 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Do you agree with the follouing statement: “Based on my oun experience and without\nknouing the particular facts of any case, if someone claims that they were abused, it is\nmore likely that I will believe they are telling the truth”?\n\n9. Do you believe that people who make allegations of being sexually abused as a child\n\nare usually telling the truth?\n\nlo. Do you believe that victims would not go through the stress of testifying at trial about\n\nthe sexual abuse they suffered as a child unless they were telling the truth?\nD. Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\nQuestionnaire Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury questionnaire or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is sufficient as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required. Nevertheless, because this issue has not been\nresolved, the Court should ask additional questions to elicit whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were deliberately false. That includes questions to establish when he first\nspoke to the press, whether he contacted the press himself, whether he got paid for his interviews,\nand what his intentions were about serving on the Maxwell jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell submits that whether Juror 5o received payment for interviews after the trial\nis probative of his intention to not disclose information during voir dire that would have called\ninto question his ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror.

The\ndistrict court denied a motion for a new trial without holding a hearing. /d.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed, ordering a new trial instead of remanding for a\nhearing. /d. at 55l-52. The court of appeals held that if “an average <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror\nwould have disclosed the information, and that information would have been significant\nand cogent evidence of the juror’s probable bias, a new trial ls required to rectify the\nfailure to disclose it.” Jd. at 552. “Good faith,” said the court, was “irrelevant to the\ninquiry.” Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals, concluding that it employed the\nwrong standard and erred in reaching the merits instead of remanding the case to the\ndistrict court for an evidentiary hearing. /d. at 556.

United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning).

Supp. 2d at l62—67 (discussing at\nlength each type of bias).\n\nl. Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be prejudiced.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting Sampson, 82o F.\nSupp. 2d at l63-64); see also Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v.

Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s post-trial conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual assault; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472. Here, not only did Juror No. 5o\nfalsely deny on the questionnaire that he had been a victim of a crime and a victim of\nsexual assault and sexual abuse, he also falsely answered the Court’s questions about\nsocial media. According to Juror No. 5o, he used only Facebook and Instagram and he\ndeleted all his social media accounts. In fact, Juror No. 5o was a Twiter user, having\njoined Twiter in April 2o2l. His Twiter account appears to have been active during trial\nand voir dire, notwithstanding his claim that he deleted all his social media accounts.\nMoreover, after trial, Juror No. 5o used Twiter to publicize his interviews with the press\nand to communicate directly to Annie Farmer. It also appears Juror No. 5o did not delete\nhis Instagram account.\n\nCrucially, “[e]ven when <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors are dishonest for reasons other than a\ndesire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir dire questions indicate that a\njuror ls unwilling or unable ‘to apply the law as instructed by the court to the evidence\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9734", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 46 of 66\nbased upon the juror’s voir dire answers.” Id.

Nevertheless, assuming this\nCourt concludes that Ms. Maxwell must prove Juror No. 5o intentionally misled the\nCourt in falsely answering Questions 25 and 48, Ms. Maxwell has easily met that burden.\n\nThere are at least six reasons to believe Juror No. 5o acted intentionally.

Juror No. 5o said he did remember the questionnaire’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the questionnaire itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and impartial.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror questionnaire approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors: (l) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6 of 49\nof being a victim of a crime. The Court asked the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors whether that information or\nthose experiences would interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the Court qualified 58 jurors. Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. Of\nthe 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question\n48 of the juror questionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:\n\ne Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative. During voir dire, Juror 8 stated that she\nand other women she knous have experienced sexual harassment, but that neither she nor\nanyone she knous has been the victim of “serious sexual harassment or assault or abuse.”\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8:l3-22. Neither the Government nor defense counsel challenged\nJuror 8 for cause.\n\ne Juror 2l wrote in response to Question 48 in her juror questionnaire that\n\n. Juror 2l\nalso reported that a friend of hers was sexually harassed and coerced into a sexual\nrelationship with his professor. Juror 2l indicated that these experiences would not affect\nher ability to be fair and impartial?\n\nIn response to additional questioning, she explained that she had reported to her school\nthat her friend was “coerced into a sexual relationship with their professor, kind of\nblackmailed into it, and then paid off by the school to keep it quiet.” Jd. at 54:6-l2. She\nreiterated that this would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Jd. Defense counsel\nrequested that the Court inquire further into whether Juror 2l’s role in the reporting would\n“color her views.” Jd. at 56:8-ll. In response, the Court inquired whether Juror 2l’s ability\nto be fair and impartial would be affected “[t]o the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse or\nharassment or the like,” to which Juror 2l responded no.

Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member.

In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them.

(See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\nquestionnaire, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\nnevertheless addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009827.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 29 of 49\ncircumstances will ever recur”). And the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the\ndefendant does not hold that a mandatory presumption of bias applies based on similarity of\nexperiences, but merely finds that the trial court acted within its discretion when it found, after a\npost-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and\nafter trial demonstrated bias. See State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2ol8); see also id. at 98\n(noting that “when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim\nwho was a minor, Juror 6 acknouledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about\nhis daughter; and . . . there appears to be litle in the way of logical explanation for hou he could\nhave differentiated between the two cases.”).\n\nMoreover, this Court’s handling of similarly situated jurors in this case is again relevant to\nthe hypothetical inquiry at issue. See, e.g., Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (implied bias finding based on\n“average man” test). If it were correct that a juror’s experience with sexual abuse required a\nmandatory presumption of bias in a sexual abuse case, the defense would have sought to strike,\nand the Court would have struck, the numerous other jurors who reported a history of sexual abuse\n(or at the very least would have pursued detailed follou-up questioning to establish the particulars\nof the abuse and the extent of any similarities to the charged conduct). But that is not what\nhappened here: Where jurors indicated a history of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court\nconducted a targeted follou-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And\nrightly so: It is not the law in this Circuit that a victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.\nOn that score, it bears emphasizing hou prevalent sexual abuse is, and hou common federal trials\ninvolving sex trafficking and child enticement are.

Mem. at 44). This claim is belied by the voir dire record. The Court did not\nask jurors who answered Question 48 in the affirmative such follou up questions, and rightly so.\nThe purpose of voir dire is not to educate <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors on the defense theories of the case or\nto determine if <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors agree with such theories or would credit specific, as-yet-uncalled\nwitnesses. Instead, the purpose of voir dire is to “screen individuals who are unable to sit in a fair\nand impartial manner.” United States v. Pirk, lS Cr. l42 (EAW), 2ol8 WL lo2744l, at *4\n(W.D.N.Y.

For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror to a blank\nversion of the questionnaire, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\nquestionnaire that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the questionnaire\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims.

In Justice Blackmun’s words,\nwhich were joined by Justices Stevens and O’Connor and expressed a view shared by Justice\nBrennan and Justice Marshall, “regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, it\nremains within a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to order a post-\n\n> The government implies something deceitful by Ms. Maxwell’s reliance on Justice\nBlackmun’s and Justice Brennan’s concurrences, noting that six justices joined Justice\nRehnquist’s McDonough majority opinion.

Juror No. 5o knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with\nminors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood\nsex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 5o did not answer Question 25,\n“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would\nlead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what\nhappened to him, which would end with his disqualification.\n\n® Greer, 285 F.3d at l73.\n\n7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient\nto entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves\non a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 3l6; McDonough, 464\nUS. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);\nSmith, 455 U.S. at 2l5-l6; id. at 22o-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3;\nGreer, 285 F.3d t l7l-72; Langford, 99o F.2d at 68. And it’s not sufficient because a juror may\nnot be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire.

The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer.

When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9889", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009890.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 32\nD.

He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page lo of l6\nwas being considered for as a juror when he went into jury selection and only learned after siting\nin the courtroom for three hours. U/d. at l3:2o-2l, l7:2o-22). He further explained that he\n“honestly never thought [he] would be chosen to sit on this jury” because of the “sheer volume of\npeople” present for jury selection; he thought “surely they will be interviewing thousands of\npeople. And they ultimately choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I would be\none of those twelve.” (/d. at l2:3-4, l3:l8-25).\n\nThe hearing held by this Court made clear that Juror 5o did not deliberately lie or engage\nin deceit in completing the questionnaire. Juror 5o made an “honest mistake.” (/d. at 23:5). The\ndefendant’s motion fails at the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nB. The Record Does Not Support a Finding that the Court Would Have\n\nGranted a Hypothetical for Cause Challenge\n\nThe hearing established that Juror 5o harbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case based on the evidence and the Court’s legal\ninstructions. If Juror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating to sexual abuse in the\nquestionnaire, the Court would have asked Juror 5o follou up questions during voir dire to\ndetermine if it would have granted a challenge for cause. The Court asked those questions at the\nhearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made clear that he was a fair and impartial juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been excused for cause. Because the defendant cannot\nestablish that Juror 5o was biased, she is not entitled to the extraordinary relief she seeks.\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror would agree that, if required to serve on a jury, they would rather do so on an\ninteresting case, and surely many <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors would find this case more interesting than a\ncontract dispute or the like. But as Juror 5o made clear repeatedly, including twice in that same\ncolloquy, he “did not set out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at l4:4-5). Were he atempting to\nlie or mislead the Court, he surely would have omited that comment and left his answer at “I did\nnot hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at l4:2). Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,\ndemonstrating his candor at the hearing—including his candor that he made no effort to be selected\nas a juror.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l2 of l6\n\nhis ability to render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial and the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law, and that “[a]bsolutely in no way” would his experience with prior sexual\nabuse interfere with his ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. (/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)). At worst, Juror 5o’s expectations about\nthe consequences of his interviews reflect naivety; they do not reflect deception.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document648_ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagel4 of l6\nl34:l5-22 (stating during voir dire that Juror 5o had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both\nsides and that he did not have any reason to think he could not be fair and impartial)). Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28). And in any event, Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing demonstrated that\nthe sexual abuse he described experiencing is not particularly similar to the abuse experienced by\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010305.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l5 ofl6\nthe victims in this case—rather, it is quite different. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 8:l4-2o (stating that he\nwas abused at age nine or ten by a family member, and that he disclosed the abuse in high school)).\n\nThere is also no basis in the record for the defendant’s request that the Court infer bias on\nthe part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 37-38). Juror 5o’s testimony does not “permit an\ninference that [he] would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47.\nInstead, Juror 5o repeatedly testified that he would be fair and impartial and decide the case based\non the evidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. See id. at 47 n.l2 (“particularly\nwhen considering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable\nbias,” judge may be “persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance”). Just as the Court properly\nelected to not exercise its discretion to infer bias where <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors disclosed during voir\ndire that they had been victims of sexual abuse or harassment, so too should the Court decline to\nmake a finding of inferred bias on the part of Juror 5o. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 29-3o). Such a finding\nis without any support in the record.\n\nThe testimony given by Juror 5o, under oath, makes clear that he was a fair and impartial\njuror. Because the defendant cannot establish either prong of the McDonough test, let alone both,\nher motion for a new trial is meritless and should be denied.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010317.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagellofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Far from\nhoping to remain anonymous, Juror 5o reveled in the atention and started posting his oun\nmessages on social media, using his actual picture and his real first name, announcing to the\nworld that he was on the Maxwell jury. (See Motion at 2o, Juror 5o’s Instagram Account) (“I\ncan nou tell everyone that I was a juror on the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.”). Juror 5o was not\nlooking to avoid notice. He was looking to soak up his l5 minutes of fame. This, again, is\nstrong evidence of Juror 5o’s bias.\n\nWhether Juror 5o’s false responses were for the purpose of securing a spot on the jury or\nbecause he was deluding himself about his ability to be impartial, Juror 5o’s multiple false\nstatements on the questionnaire and to the Court add to the bases for finding that he should have\nbeen struck for cause. See Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l65 (“Even when <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors are\ndishonest for reasons other than a desire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir\ndire questions indicate that a juror is unwilling or unable to apply the law as instructed by the\ncourt to the evidence presented by the parties and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of\nimpartiality[.]” (internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nFinally, Juror 5o admited that he was perfectly willing to disregard the Court\ninstructions. In light of his statements that he “flew through” the questionnaire, the Court asked\nJuror 5o whether he was concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions. (Tr. l8). Juror 5o\nresponded, “Absolutely not.” (/d.). When the Court asked him again, he again responded “No, I\nreally ... this is a terrible excuse, but I didn’t really think I would be chosen.” (/d.). A\nwillingness to disregard the Court’s instructions shous an inability to serve as an unbiased juror\nand raises independent grounds for a for cause challenge. See Dyer v.

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo326", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page4of4o\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\n\nI BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page5of4o\n\nThe final questionnaire contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers. Dkt. No. 462. Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, harassment, and assault.\n\nQuestion 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a\nvictim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),” “Yes\n(friend or family member),” and “No.” Jd. at l3. Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there\nanything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in\nthis case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 25b asked: “If\nyes to 25a, please explain.” Several lines were then provided for the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror to explain\ntheir answer. /d.\n\nQuestion 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault?

Like Question 25, there were three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),”\n“Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” Question 48a next asked: “If yes, without listing\nnames, please explain.” Space was provided to write an answer. Question 48b asked: “If your\nanswer to 48 was yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in this case?” There were two answer choices: “Yes” and “No.” Finally,\nQuestion 48c asked: “If yes to 48b, please explain.” Like Question 48a, several lines of space\nwere provided to answer the question. /d.\n\nFinally, Question 49 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault?

No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22.

The Court also rejected many of the Defendant’s\nproposed lines of questions. The parties were also permited to propose follou-up questions at\nthe hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 5o’s responses. The Court accepted\nsome of these proposals and rejected others.\n\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate. He\nexplained that when he was nine and ten years old, he was abused on multiple occasions by a\nstepbrother, who he no longer considered part of the family, and one of the stepbrother’s friends.\nHearing Tr. at 8. He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school. His mother\ncalled the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought. /d. at 8-9. Although he first\ntestified that “no” was correct for Question 49 because he did not consider the stepbrother part of\nhis family, upon further questioning from the Court, he acknouledged that the correct answer\nwould have been “yes.” /d. at ll-l3. He similarly acknouledged that “yes (self)” would have\nbeen correct to Question 25; although at the time of the questionnaire, he understood the question\nto be asking about being “robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that.” /d. at 9-lo.\n\nJuror 5o testified that these incorrect answers were an inadvertent mistake and that he had\nnot intentionally failed to disclose his personal history of sexual abuse. /d. at l4-l6, 22-23. He\nexplained that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “completely skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand the questions. /d. at l4-l5. It took several hours to start\nthe questionnaire after a long security line and technical issues with the Court’s instructional\nvideo. His mind was preoccupied with a recent romantic breakup and the commotion at the\nnearby check-out table. He saw other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors completing their questionnaires and\nrushed to finish. He explained that he was unconcerned with diligently completing the\nquestionnaire; he assumed due to the sheer “volume” of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors being screened that it\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010334.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagell of 4o\nwas impossible he would be selected as a final juror. /d. at ll-l3, l8. He testified that his\npersonal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not\ncrossed his mind as he filled out the questionnaire.\n\nThe Court asked follou-up questions consistent with those asked of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors\nduring voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires,\nincluding those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial. Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt. Nos. 648, 649.7\n\nll. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants “the right to a speedy and public\ntrial[] by an impartial jury.” U.S. Const. amend. VI.

And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. /d. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire ls frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48.\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . . . who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as ajuror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause. Like Juror B, Juror 5o credibly\naffirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might\n6 To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to\nspecific juror numbers. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6); Press-Enter. Co. v.\nSuperior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). In this opinion, Juror A refers to Juror fj Juror\nB refers to Juror fj and Juror C refers to Juror The Court has provided an unredacted copy of the Opinion &\nOrder to the parties and will file an unredacted copy under seal.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010352.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 29 of 4o\nbe discussed at trial would [not] interfere with [his] ability to be fair or impartial as a juror in the\ncase.” See Hearing Tr. at 27.7\n\nAccordingly, even if Juror 5o had disclosed his abuse during jury selection, the Court\nwould not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause, as consistent with other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors who disclosed similar experiences. This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testimony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\nTn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who answered “yes\n(self).” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo352", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions\nduring the voir dire process for other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010362.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 39 of 4o\n\nEven if confined to the questionnaire session, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s\n“willingness to disregard the Court’s instructions” during the questionnaire “shous an inability\nto serve as an unbiased juror.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the questionnaire does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing.

Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019524.jpg": "CaSeide22oeB ODB AosIINe MdtuMen? 82-o2 OF RES O7328 2o9 Ragef 3 5 l2\nindependent contractors by the defendant’s counsel (“Defense\nStaff”);\n\nai. any expert or potential expert, legal\nadvisor, consultant, or any other individual retained or\nemployed by the Defendant and Defense Counsel for the purpose of\nassisting in the defense of this case (“Defense\nExperts/Advisors”) ;\n\nai. such other persons as hereafter may be\nauthorized by Order of the Court (“Other Authorized Persons”);\n\ne) May be provided to <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> witnesses and\n\ntheir counsel (collectively, “Potential Defense Witnesses”), to\nthe extent deemed necessary by defense counsel, for trial\npreparation.

She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access.

Nos. 372, 373, 375. The Court will\nprovide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on\nNovember l6 at the commencement of voir dire.

The Court is still considering the logistics of when\nperemptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will\nbe exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the swearing in of the jury, preliminary\ninstructions, and opening statements would commence immediately follouing the\nsimultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory challenges.

The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\nquestionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media.

The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the questionnaire. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the questionnaire is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the questionnaire accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the questionnaire. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the questionnaire.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020947.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel2l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 4 of 4o\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o947", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020948.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel22 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 5 of 4o\n\nThe final questionnaire contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers. Dkt. No. 462. Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, harassment, and assault.\n\nQuestion 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a\nvictim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),” “Yes\n(friend or family member),” and “No.” /d. at l3. Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there\nanything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in\nthis case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 25b asked: “If\nyes to 25a, please explain.” Several lines were then provided for the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror to explain\ntheir answer. /d.\n\nQuestion 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted sexual assault or other\n\nunwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or\n\nfamily member).\nId. at 24. Like Question 25, there were three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),”\n“Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” Question 48a next asked: “If yes, without listing\nnames, please explain.” Space was provided to write an answer. Question 48b asked: “If your\nanswer to 48 was yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in this case?” There were two answer choices: “Yes” and “No.” Finally,\nQuestion 48c asked: “If yes to 48b, please explain.” Like Question 48a, several lines of space\nwere provided to answer the question. /d.\n\nFinally, Question 49 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault?

The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors were excused by consent.\nTd. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o949", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020950.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire.

Consistent with other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues.

No. 593 at 29-3o.\n\nA week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the Government\ninformed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to press outlets\nabout his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater. Dkt. No. 568. The leter\nnoted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror “described being a\nvictim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the jury questionnaire and did not\nrecall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at l. The Government\nindicated that it believed the juror to be Juror 5o, and a review of his questionnaire shoued that\nhe had provided a negative response to a question that asked whether a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror had\nbeen a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 2 n.2; see also Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at 3 & n.l, Dkt.\nNo. 62o. A leter from the Defendant folloued shortly thereafter also informing the Court about\nthe juror’s interviews. Dkt. No. 569.

The Court also rejected many of the Defendant’s\nproposed lines of questions. The parties were also permited to propose follou-up questions at\nthe hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 5o’s responses. The Court accepted\nsome of these proposals and rejected others.\n\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate. He\nexplained that when he was nine and ten years old, he was abused on multiple occasions by a\nstepbrother, who he no longer considered part of the family, and one of the stepbrother’s friends.\nHearing Tr. at 8. He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school. His mother\ncalled the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought. /d. at 8-9. Although he first\ntestified that “no” was correct for Question 49 because he did not consider the stepbrother part of\nhis family, upon further questioning from the Court, he acknouledged that the correct answer\nwould have been “yes.” /d. at ll-l3. He similarly acknouledged that “yes (self)” would have\nbeen correct to Question 25; although at the time of the questionnaire, he understood the question\nto be asking about being “robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that.” /d. at 9-lo.\n\nJuror 5o testified that these incorrect answers were an inadvertent mistake and that he had\nnot intentionally failed to disclose his personal history of sexual abuse. /d. at l4-l6, 22-23. He\nexplained that he was distracted as he filled out the questionnaire and “completely skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand the questions. /d. at l4-l5. It took several hours to start\nthe questionnaire after a long security line and technical issues with the Court’s instructional\nvideo. His mind was preoccupied with a recent romantic breakup and the commotion at the\nnearby check-out table. He saw other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors completing their questionnaires and\nrushed to finish. He explained that he was unconcerned with diligently completing the\nquestionnaire; he assumed due to the sheer “volume” of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors being screened that it\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o953", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020954.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel28 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page ll of 4o\nwas impossible he would be selected as a final juror. /d. at ll-l3, l8. He testified that his\npersonal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not\ncrossed his mind as he filled out the questionnaire.\n\nThe Court asked follou-up questions consistent with those asked of <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors\nduring voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires,\nincluding those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial. Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt. Nos. 648, 649.7\n\nIl. LEGAL STANDARD\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants “the right to a speedy and public\ntrial[] by an impartial jury.” U.S. Const. amend. VI.

And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020966.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. Jd. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire is frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o966", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020969.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel43 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 26 of 4o\nbased on the purported similarities between his personal history and the issues at trial. Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become irrelevant.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o969", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the questionnaire.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020971.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel45 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 28 of 4o\npersonal experience with sexual assault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority of these\neight jurors, the Defendant did not propose any follou-up questions. The Defendant did not\nchallenge any of these <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors for cause on the basis of the juror’s answer to Question\n48,\n\nSome of these jurors disclosed experiences distinct from that disclosed by Juror 5o—for\nexample, sexual harassment on the subway. Two jurors, houever, disclosed experiences similar\nto that of Juror 5o, neither of whom was challenged for cause. Juror A reported that she was\n“sexually molested by an uncle when [she] was l2, l3.”° Although this juror was even closer in\nage to the victim-witnesses when they first were abused, and presumably abused by “someone\nfamiliar to [her] . .. who was part of [her] life,” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4, the Defendant\ndid not propose any follou-up questions or challenge the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> juror for cause. Like Juror\nA, Juror 5o credibly affirmed that his personal experience would not impact his ability to be fair\nor impartial nor would the subject mater “upset [him] in such a way that would distract [him]\nfrom [his] duty as a juror.” See Hearing Tr. at 26-27. Next, Juror B explained that just two\nyears before jury selection, she had reported that a friend was being coerced and sexually abused\nby a professor. At the Defendant’s request, the Court asked whether the experience might in any\nway interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial to the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse. She affirmed that\nit would not, and the Defendant did not challenge her for cause. Like Juror B, Juror 5o credibly\naffirmed at the March 8 hearing that “issues of reporting or not reporting sexual abuse that might\n© To further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the Court has redacted references to\nspecific juror numbers.

This is so because our system of trial by jury does not\nexclude individuals with experiences similar to the issues at trial when those individuals can\nserve fairly and impartially. This Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who\nhad a family member murdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully\nin fraud trials and individuals who have been discriminated against have served without bias in\ndiscrimination trials.\n\nSo the critical question, as for any juror, is whether the juror has the ability to decide the\ncase based only on the evidence presented in court, not extraneous information, and without bias,\nprejudice, or sympathy. See U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 8l3, 8l8 (2d Cir. l97o).\nJuror 5o repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed his ability to do just that. And for all the reasons\narticulated above, the Court found that testrmony credible. To imply or infer that Juror 5o was\nbiased—simply because he was himself a victim of sexual abuse in a trial related to sexual abuse\nand sex trafficking, and despite his oun credible testimony under the penalty of perjury,\nestablishing that he could be an even-handed and impartial juror—would be tantamount to\nconcluding that an individual with a history of sexual abuse can never serve as a fair and\n7 Tn her pre-hearing briefing, the Defendant raises that out of 694 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors, the parties jointly agreed to\nexcuse 67 of the ll4 <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, and the “Court granted” the\nDefendant’s challenges to 23 and the Government’s challenges to 2 additional <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who answered “yes\n(self).”” Maxwell Br. at 9-lo. But that is a mischaracterization. First, a significant number of those <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a variety of reasons. Second, and as noted above, all of\nthose excusals “resulted from the parties’ agreement, not from the court’s analysis of each challenged juror’s ability\nto be impartial.” Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439. “The question nou is whether [Juror 5o’s] omission reveals a\nbias sufficient to support a for-cause challenge.” Jd. As explained above, it does not.\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o972", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020979.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel53 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions\nduring the voir dire process for other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o979", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service.

Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\ncd Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l444", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021454.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page24 of 2l7\nSA-278\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 278 of 348\n\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals.

Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l454", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021459.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 383 3536o39, Page29 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 283 of 348\nand consider victims’ views about, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations.*°* The “prosecution stage”\nbegan when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*”\n\nAt the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2oo7, few courts had addressed victim\nstanding under the CVRA.

The Jury Selection Process\n\nIn November 2o2l, in advance of trial, 694 jurors\ncompleted a juror questionnaire approved by the Dis-\ntrict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror questionnaire\nwas 29 pages and consisted of 5l questions, many of\nwhich contained subparts. (A.29o-3l7). After the par-\nties reviewed the questionnaires, 23l of the 694 pro-\nceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court\nthen examined <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury questionnaire that <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court\nqualified 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.7l7). Of the 58 indi-\nviduals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight in-\ndividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-\ntionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021711.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page64 of 93\n5l\n\nsexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,\nand that this experience would not affect their ability\nto serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.\n(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.l8, 52, 2oo, 2o7, 259, 293, 532,\n538-39, 635). Each confirmed that he or she could be\nfair and impartial, and defense counsel did not move\nto strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer\nto Question 48. (A.345).\n\nFor instance, one juror said that she was “sexually\nmolested by an uncle when she was l2 or l8,” but that\nwould not affect her ability to be fair and impartial in\nthe case. (A.345). Another juror indicated that she had\nrecently “reported that a friend was being coerced and\nsexually abused by a professor,” but confirmed that ex-\nperience would not “in any way interfere with her abil-\nity to be fair and impartial” in this case. (/d.). Neither\nthe Government nor defense counsel challenged those\njurors for cause.\n\nThe parties then exercised their peremptory\nstrikes, and a jury was seated.\n\n2. Juror 5o\n\nJuror 5o completed the questionnaire and was\nquestioned by Judge Nathan during voir dire. In his\nquestionnaire, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he\ncould be fair and impartial. In response to Question l3,\n\nl2 Twelve of the 58 qualified <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors in-\ndicated that a friend or family member had been a vic-\ntim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual as-\nsault.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021714.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page67 of 93\n54\n\nsexual harassment or abuse), and 49 (whether he or a\nfriend or family member had been accused of sexual\nharassment or abuse). He explained that, when he was\nnine or ten years old, he was sexually abused by a step-\nbrother, who he no longer considered part of the fam-\nily, and the stepbrother’s friend. He explained that he\nanswered Question 49 “no” because he no longer con-\nsidered the stepbrother part of his family, although he\nshould have answered “yes.” He also acknouledged\nthat he should have answered “yes” to Question 25 be-\ncause he was a crime victim, although he read the\nquestion at the time to inquire about robbery, mug-\nging, or similar crimes. (A.267-68).\n\nJuror 5o also testified that his failure to disclose\nthis experience was an inadvertent mistake. He ex-\nplained that he “completely skimmed way too fast”\nwhen completing the questionnaire. (A.27o-7l). He did\nso, he explained, in light of the context: he started the\nquestionnaire after several hours’ waiting in security\nlines and after technical issues with the instructions.\nHe was preoccupied with his oun recent romantic\nbreakup and with disruptions in the jury room. And he\nrushed to complete his questionnaire because he\nthought it virtually impossible that he would be se-\nlected as a juror given the number of people complet-\ning the questionnaire. He did not generally think\nabout his personal history of sexual abuse, and it did\nnot occur to him while carelessly speeding through the\nquestionnaire. (A.269-72).\n\nAt oral voir dire, Juror 5o had not been asked the\nquestions Judge Nathan posed to <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> jurors\nwho answered affirmatively to questions 25, 48, or 49,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021722.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page75 of 93\n62\n\nMaxwell. Judge Nathan also correctly rejected Max-\nwell’s “central argument” that she should imply or in-\nfer bias “based on the purported similarities between\n[Juror 5o’s] personal history and the issues at trial.”\n(A.342-43). Judge Nathan explained that she “need not\nimagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that\nconclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every\nfollou-up question requested by the Defendant with\nregard to a juror’s personal experience with sexual as-\nsault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority\nof these eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose\nany follou-up questions.” (A.344-45). One <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span>\njuror described her oun childhood sexual abuse at an\nage closer to the victims in this case; another described\na friend’s recent coercive sexual abuse by a professor.\n(A.345). Maxwell did not even bring a for-cause chal-\nlenge as to either. Ud.). Similarly, a for-cause chal-\nlenge against Juror 5o would not have prevailed.\n\nOn appeal, Maxwell contends that, had Juror 5o\nanswered the questionnaire accurately, it “clearly”\nwould have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.”\n(Br.67).

The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2328o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023290.jpg": "(e) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised\nrelease, if any, that are imposed.\n(6) Referrals. Once charges are filed, the responsible official shall assist the victim\nin contacting the persons or offices responsible for providing the services and relief\n[previously identified].\n\nc. Consultation With a Government Atorney\n\n(l) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case. The victim’s right to confer, houever, shall not be\nconstrued to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be\navailable to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,\nrelease of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for\nnoninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because\nvictims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose\nwhatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only\nnonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the\nprosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.\nRepresentatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither\nthe Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department\nmay make on their behalf constitutes or creates an atorney-client relationship\nbetween such victims and the lawyers for the Government.\nDepartment personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.\n(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult\nwith victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays\nin the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court\nof the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.\n(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable\nefforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,\n<span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible\nofficial should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving\nnotice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not\nlimited to, the follouing factors:\n\n(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.\n\n(b) The number of victims.\n\n(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.\n\n252\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2329o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023295.jpg": "and consider victims’ views about, <span class=\"highlight\">prospective</span> plea negotiations.*”?
