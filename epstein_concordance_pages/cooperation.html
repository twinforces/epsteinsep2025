In 2oll and 2ol2, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government\nto conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the\nbasis of changes to the 2oo3 Extradition Act. Ud. Annex B § 3.l).\n\nIn Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\nsuccessfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julie Rep.) (atached as\nExhibit V). Mr. Julie explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition\nof a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (/d. at l).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001204.jpg": "CaSese 2o-ef o S2osAd Me niDoGchnteH) lo22l, ARB l2o5729 e Rage Hof 4\nWILLIAM JULIE\nAVOCAT A LA COUR\n\nchallenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial\nreview of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure.\nSecondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the\noutcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts.\nThird, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

This concern over opportunistic nationality applications is precisely the justification of\nthe rule mentioned in academic literature (see for example Repertoire de droit penal et\nde procedure penale Extradition Pen. — Conditions de fond de l'extradition —\nDelphine Brach-Thiel-October 2ol8, §59).\n\nl8. Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously.

Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2.

Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002006.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 34 of 45\nappeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in leading extradition cases; and\nhas acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on international <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n(/d.).

(Perry Rep.\n4 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. JJ] 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\nfavor of extradition”.\n\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer is not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it ls highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\n\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> of the authorities of that State.\n\n22.

As noted above, two\nkey witnesses who helped give rise to the instant charges did not agree to speak law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9, facts that significantly undercut the notion that the Government was intentionally\nsiting on a criminal case against the defendant for any meaningful period of time.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> as part of a plea agreement, or compelling <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003338.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> when such <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”°° The\n“<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” contemplated was <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an ‘“‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 223 of 348\nee.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 2o\nthat Giuffre possessed in February and March 2ol6.

USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l63 of 349\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> when such <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment). The\n“<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” contemplated was <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004461.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l64 of 349\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\n\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\n\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo446l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l95 of 349\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 74”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004499.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o2 of 349\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.~° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerms about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2oo Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\na In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004508.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ll of 349\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- oooo45o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004521.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 224 of 349\neaten, U.S. Department of Fustice\ngrate Federal Burcau of Investigation\nay FBI - West Palm Beach\nree cey Suite 5oo\noa 3o5 South Flagler Drive\nWest Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPhone: (56l) 833-75l7\nFax: (36l) 833-797o\nAugust 278, 2oo6\nRe: Case Number: a\na\nYour name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Programas being a possible victim of a federal ‘\ncrime.

The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order.

The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page l3 of 8o\nCanadian authorities, in turn, referred the complaint to Philadelphia Police.\nPhiladelphia forwarded the complaint to Cheltenham Police.

In making this finding, the District\nAtorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable\noffenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal\nintent. In addition, District Atorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence\ngoverning whether or not evidence is admissible.

Instead,\nCosby presented a narrative of a consensual sexual encounter with Constand, which he\nasserted again later in his depositions. “Thus,” the trial court explained, “there was\nnothing to indicate that [Cosby’s] <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> would cease if a civil case were filed.” /d.\nat 65. Since Cosby previously had discussed the incident without invoking his right to\nremain silent, the court found no reason to believe that Cosby subsequently would do so\nin a civil case so as to necessitate the remedy that the former district atorney purported\nto provide in anticipation of that litigation.\n\nThe trial court further held that, even if there was a purported grant of immunity,\nCosby could not insist upon its enforcement based upon the contractual theory of\npromissory estoppel, because “any reliance on a press release as a grant of immunity\nwas unreasonable.” /d.

The failure to demand\nwriten documentation was evidence that no promise not to prosecute was ever extended.\nFor these reasons, the trial court found no legal basis to estop the Commonwealth from\nprosecuting Cosby.\n\nCosby filed a notice of appeal and a petition for review with the Superior Court. In\nresponse to the filings, the Superior Court temporarily stayed the proceedings belou.\nHouever, upon a motion by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court quashed the appeal\nand lifted the stay.

(quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(b)). Because no such order existed here, the\nSuperior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\ndetermination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed\nto seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 4l2. “Only a court\norder conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.\n\nThe Superior Court further rejected Cosby’s invocation of promissory estoppel\nasserting reliance upon D.A. Castors assurances, as demonstrated by Cosby’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with Constand’s civil suit and his decision not to invoke the Fifth Amendment\nduring his deposition testimony. The panel opined that Cosby failed to cite sufficient\nauthority to establish that a prosecution may be barred under a promissory estoppel\ntheory. The panel further agreed with the trial court that, in any event, “it was not\nreasonable for [Cosby] to rely on Mr. Castor’s promise, even if the trial court had found\ncredible the testimony provided by Mr. Castor and [Cosby’s] civil atorney,” Atorney\nSchmit. /d. The panel stated: “We cannot deem reasonable [Cosby’s] reliance on such\na promise when he was represented by counsel, especially when immunity can only be\ngranted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at\n4l3.\n\nThe Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the\nrecord that [Cosby] actually declined to assert his Fifth Amendment rights at the civil\ndeposition based on Mr. Castor’s purported promise not to prosecute.” /d. Although the\ncourt noted that Atorney Schmit was the only witness who could testify that Cosby\nindeed relied upon Castor’s purported promise during his deposition (Atorney Schmit\ndid so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Atorney Schmit\nalloued Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby\ndid not incriminate himself at that point, that Atorney Schmit further negotiated with the\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4857\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 69\n\nnot charge Ms. Maxwell until later in its investigation (the “New York Investigation”).

As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006454.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 69\n\nnot charge Ms. Maxwell until later in its investigation (the “New York Investigation”).

Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page /7oflo\nPage 7\n\nthat is specifically charged in the indictment” or that is the subject of the relevant trial.

See United States v. Beech-Nut\nNutrition Corp., 87l F.2d ll8l, ll99 (2d Cir. l989) (“Coconspirator statements may be found to\nbe ‘in furtherance’ of the conspiracy within the meaning of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E) if they ‘prompt the\nlistener to respond in a way that facilitates the carrying out of criminal activity.’” (quoting Kahme,\n8l3 F.2d at 35)).

The issue in that case was not expert testimony, but rather whether the Government\nshould have been required to disclose a confidential informant’s mental health records, and whether\nthe defendant should have been alloued to cross-examine the informant using those records.

In that case, the Second Circuit affirmed a district court’s refusal to allou inquiry into a\nfemale victim’s addiction, absent any evidence that she was under the influence either during the\nrelevant events or while testifying. United States v. DiPaolo, 8o4 F.2d 225, 229-3o (2d Cir. l986).\nBecause those are the only relevant inquiries, and because Dr. Hall’s opinion offers nothing on either,\nhis testimony that [EE should be excluded.\n\nIII.

(Compare Mot. l2 with Opp. l4-l5).\nInstead she offers three different rules of evidence under which she hopes to admit the hearsay.\nNone is valid:\n\nRule 7o3.

First, the atorney-client privilege\ndoes not apply to Mr. Glassman’s statement to Jane that cooperating and testifying would “help\nher case.” Second, even if the privilege did apply, it was waived when Mr. Glassman relayed his\nstatement to the government. Ex. l (35o9-o22).\n\n“The atorney-client privilege protects from disclosure (l) a communication between\nclient and counsel that (2) was intended to be and was in fact kept confidential, and (3) was made\nfor the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.” Jn re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 4l3, 4l9\n(2d Cir. 2oo7). “The burden of establishing the atorney-client privilege, in all its elements,\nalways rests upon the person asserting it.” United States v.

United\nStates v.

The atorney-client privilege is one such interest. See Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo,\n4lo (l988) (“The accused does not have an unfetered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,\nprivileged, or otherwise inadmissible under the standard rules of evidence.” (emphasis added)).\nWhere the privilege applies, it is “essential to the protection of [the client’s] legal rights,” and\n“stands in derogation of the public’s right to every man’s evidence.” Jn re Horouitz, 482 F.2d 72,\n8l (2d Cir. l973) (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nI. Discussion\n\nAs a general mater, Jane and Glassman’s conversations with each other in which Glassman\nprovided legal advice are privileged. They were: (l) between a client and counsel, (2) remain\nconfidential, and (3) for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\nThe defense has two theories by which Glassman’s alleged statement to Jane that her\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and testimony would “help her case” is not privileged: (l) it was not intended to be\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page4of8\nkept confidential because it was information the Government “would want to knou” and “Jane\nwould want the government to knou,” (Def. Leter at 2); and (2) any privilege was waived when\nthe statement was disclosed to the Government. These arguments lack merit. The first suggests a\nlimitation on the privilege that would swallou its protections. The second errs because Glassman\ncould not waive the privilege. And in any event, the probative value of this testimony is so slight\nthat it should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nFirst, the defense argues that the advice was not intended to be kept confidential because\n“Jane’s motive for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is\nessential to the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.” (Def. Leter at 3). This theory suggests that anything which would be essential to\nthe Government’s assessment of a witness’ credibility and preparation for cross-examination\ncannot be kept confidential, and so is not privileged. Such a rule is not the law. If it were, it would\neffectuate a subject-mater waiver about innumerable topics, to the great detriment of the atorney-\nclient relationship. The Government and the defense would be entitled to invade that relationship\nto learn about the client’s discussions on topics that go to bias, motive, or other items material to\na case. For instance, the Government frequently calls witnesses testifying pursuant to a\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> agreement. Once the <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> agreement is signed, the Government could not—\nand would not—ask the cooperator for a proffer of their conversations with their counsel about\ntheir motives to testify. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 567 (“THE COURT: The atorney’s advice to the\nclient about whether they should take a plea and what assistance that might get them and all of that\nobviously is privileged.”). Or, for instance, the Government sometimes immunizes witnesses and\ncalls them to testify. The Government could not—and would not—ask the immunized witnesses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo824o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document528 Filed l2/o6/2l Page6of8\nthere is no reason to think Jane expressly or implicitly authorized Glassman to waive her privilege\non the topic of Glassman’s advice to Jane about assisting the Government. Despite the Court’s\ninvitation, the defendant has offered no argument to the contrary. l2/ol/2l Tr. at 573 (“THE\nCOURT: “Well right. But whether he waived — whether the privilege — it’s the client’s to waive,\nI think. That will be part of the briefing, I suppose.”).\n\nNor is this a case in which Jane impliedly waived privilege. Jane has not testified\n“concerning portions of the atorney-client communication,” placed “the atorney-client\nrelationship directly at issue,” or asserted “reliance on an atorney’s advice as an element ofa claim\nor defense.” Jn re County of Erie, 546 F.3d at 228. On that first point, Jane was asked whether\nshe “knew” that her <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the Government would benefit her civil litigation or her\nclaim with the victim’s compensation fund, and she said no. l2/l/2l Tr. at 58l. Neither of those\nanswers described portions of her communications with her atorney. It is the defense which is\ninjecting the atorney-client relationship into the trial by atempting to use privileged\ncommunications to impeach Jane. That cannot constitute a privilege waiver by Jane.?\n\nThird, even if Glassman’s statement to the Government could waive Jane’s privilege, the\nCourt should exclude that evidence under Rule 4o3. Any waiver would at most cover whatever\nstatement Glassman made to the Government, and not the subject mater of his advice to Jane\nabout <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>. See l2/ol/2l (defense counsel stating that “whatever he communicated to the\ngovernment is what was waived. I don’t think he’s waived — I’m not arguing for subject mater\nwaiver, for example.”). The defense has other avenues to suggest that cooperating with the\n3 For these reasons, the cases cited by the defense are inapposite. (Def. Leter at 3-4).

And insofar as the point is to\nimpeach Jane, this statement is of minimal impeachment value. Jane said no when asked whether\nshe knew that “<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the government, including testifying, would benefit you in your\ncivil litigation against the Epstein estate and Ms. Maxwell.” l2/ol/2l Tr. at 58l; see id. (asking\nthe same question about her knouledge “at any point” regarding Jane’s civil litigation). As of\nAugust l7, 2o2l, the date of the statement from Glassman to the Government, Jane had been paid\nby the Epstein Victims Compensation Fund, and her civil case had been dismissed. And Glassman\nappears to have advised Jane that the civil cases were fully resolved. See l2/ol/2l Tr. at 6l9\n(testimony by Jane that she does not have a financial stake in the outcome of this trial).4 At most,\nthen, the statement means that Glassman, at some point in the past, advised Jane that testifying\nwould aid another “case.” And at most, that would impeach Jane by suggesting that, while she\naccurately testified that she did not “knou” that her “<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the government, including\ntestifying,” would benefit her in her civil case or EVCP claim, she had been told that at one point\nin the past.\n\nBy contrast, there is significant risk that admission of the statement would require\nGlassman to divulge further privileged communications with Jane. Glassman’s comment to the\nGovernment is not easily intelligible. Glassman referenced “help[ing] her case,” which is not\nspecifically a reference to civil litigation or her claim with the EVCP, and says that “it,” whatever\nit is, would help that case. (Def. Leter Ex. A). To explain what Glassman is referencing, and\nwhen he gave that advice, he would likely have to provide more content to his advice to Jane and\n* The Government is of course not aware of Glassman’s privileged advice to Jane.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document544 Filed l2/l4/2l Page4of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

It does not mater that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Leter at\n2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to contact Carolyn\nprobative (id. at 3).'

Leter at 4). This argument does not demonstrate relevance\nfor two reasons. First, that articulation of bias maters only insofar as Carolyn was aware of the\ndate the EVCP began accepting claims when she decided to cooperate with the Government. But\nshe testified that she was not aware of that fact, and none of Scarola’s anticipated testimony would\ncontradict Carolyn’s testimony on that point. (Tr. l683). This bias theory accordingly has no\nfactual predicate. Second, even if the defendant’s timeline testimony did go to bias in some way,\nthe additional facts the defense would elicit from Scarola do not. For instance, Carolyn testified\nthat she was largely out of touch between 2oo7 and July 2o2o, notwithstanding emails forwarded\nby Scarola, as noted above. Nothing about that timeline changes if the jury learns that the\nGovernment gave Scarola the contact information for an agent in February 2o2o.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Imposing such an obligation on Scarola would have an immediate\nchilling effect on Carolyn and Scarola’s atorney-client relationship, and it would confuse the jury\nby suggesting they should infer the existence and substance of privileged conversations for which\nthere is no evidence. Whether or not Scarola testifies as the defendant suggests, there will be no\nevidence from which the jury can properly conclude that Scarola had any particular conversation\nwith Carolyn on any topic.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” /d. (citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page7of8\nfront of their friends, families, and communities. For instance, Government cooperators and\nconfidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the\nGovernment made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\nresistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be\npublicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury. See l8 U.S.C. § l62l. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be\ninterviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do so. And\nthe Government has the same pouers and limitations. Put simply, the defendant’s constitutional\nrights are not infringed if this Court follous the same rule as every other court in every other trial,\nhigh profile or not.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 BANISH\nSHEA &\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The veracity and/or\nsignificance of a statement Ms. Moe believes Mr. Glassman made to her about an alleged\nstatement he made to his client is simply irrelevant.\n\nJane respectfully requests that Ms. Maxwell’s motion be denied outright.\n\nBut if the Court is inclined to entertain the motion further, Jane requests that Ms.\nMaxwell provide the precise question or questions that Ms. Maxwell’s counsel intends to ask Mr.\nGlassman. And that Mr. Glassman be permited time to obtain an advisory opinion from ethics\ncounsel and perhaps from the California State Bar as to whether he would be permited to answer\nsuch a question or questions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00011998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 743 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 226 of 247 358\nLBUVMAX6 Jane - direct\n\nl the truth or not, which is precisely why I granted the Rule l7\n2 subpoena and, I suspect, in the opening raised this issue\n\n3 precisely.

(Perry Rep.\n§ 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).\n\nFrance. The accompanying report of William Julie (“Julie Rep.”) reviews the French\nextradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julie is an expert on\nFrench extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European\nUnion and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts.

Durbin and Barack Obama in their\naforementioned leter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in\nits memorandum:\n\n“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in\n\npertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the\n\nextradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article\n\ndoes not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not\n\nappear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such\n\nextradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in\n\nfavor of extradition ”.\nI am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I\ncame to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary pouer ls not a legal rule.\nIndeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these\nreasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of\nthis case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an\nextradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable\nwaiver in the USA.\nFinally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations\nof the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would\nalso need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and\nthe United States of America, which came into force on February l*', 2olo, several years after\nthe Peterson case. Article l of this Agreement, which enhances <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> between\nContracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the context of\napplicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America\ngoverning extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken\ninto account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to\ngrant the extradition of a French national to the USA.\n\nWilliam JULIE\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents\nand case law\n\nl9. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case\ncan be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied\nto protect a formerly French national from extradition.\n\n2o. Instead, precedents exist in which Article 696-4,l° of the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure was relied on by French authorities to execute an extradition request against\nan individual who had acquired French nationality after commiting an offence, which\nis the natural use of this provision (for example, a ruling issued by the Criminal Chamber\nof the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2oo6, n°o5-86.258).\n\n2l. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the\nextradition of a person who had lost French nationality, we have found cases where\nFrench authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French\nnationality. Both extradition and deportation allou for the removal of a person from\nFrench territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with\nthe consent and <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> of the authorities of that State.\n\n22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation\nanalogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars\napply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court\nconsiders that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article\n3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State.

It also explains its decision to deny the government’s\nAmended Emergency Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Release Order. Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of\nJustice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n§ l5l3(a)(l)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(l) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2.

Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021021.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel95 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” Jd.

But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of intentional delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion.

Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021336.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l62 of 348\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” Jd. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> when such <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).”° The\n“<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” contemplated was <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021337.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pagel65 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l63 of 348\nagreement that did not require Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.?°°\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o8 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villatafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021368.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l94 3536o38, Pagel96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l94 of 348\n\nLourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ |]... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute ‘any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates.?”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in another federal\nae As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021375.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ol 3536o38, Page2o3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ol of 348\nEpstein’s state guilty plea.°? As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcerns about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, but that step had not been taken.*°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n2o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n424 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n258 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstein and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021384.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo. 3536o38, Page2l2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 348\nwhich Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted.\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n#9o In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA.

Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.5 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*”> As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n372 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\nae Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\ncual The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\nBia This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021840.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel6 of 5l\none USAO is presumed not to bind other USAOs.* To the contrary, the weight of\nauthority holds that a representation by the United States Atorney or her agents will\nbind USAOs in other districts, ifnot the federal Government as a whole.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023163.tif": "<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> as part of a plea agreement, or compelling <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023174.tif": "As the U.S. Atorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was\nmotivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the\nUSAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail belou,\nOPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or\ninfluenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required\nAcosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the\nstate, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nB. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a\n\nNon-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein\n\nOPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.\n\nThe prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through\na non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution\nagreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 8l8 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2ol6). These agreements\n“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal\nconviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a\ndefendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability\naltogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case\nthrough a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally\nwith the Executive” branch. /d. at 74l.\n\nOPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-\nprosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically\nauthorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution\nagreements made in exchange for a person’s timely <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> when such <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> would put\nthe person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as\ntestimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.6oo (comment).?°° The\n“<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” contemplated was <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the criminal investigation or prosecution of\nanother person. In certain circumstances, government atorneys were required to obtain approval\nfrom the appropriate Assistant Atorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement\nin exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>.\n\nEpstein, houever, was not providing “<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” as contemplated by the USAM, and the\nUSAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in\ncircumstances other than in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in the investigation or prosecution of\nanother. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases\ninvolving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other\nsituations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous\nobligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution\n2o5 USAM § 9-27.65o required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> be fully\nmemorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied\nby fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.\n\nl36\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023175.tif": "agreement that did not require Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain\nDepartmental approval before doing so.\nC. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and\nUnambiguous Standards\n\nAlthough Acosta, as U.S. Atorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a\nnon-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a\nclear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.\nSpecifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal\ninvestigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution\nand solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an l8-month sentence of\nincarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-\nprosecution agreements not involving <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, OPR examined Departmental policies relating\nto plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also\nexamined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”\nto determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.\nFinally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the\nDepartment’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required\nfurther action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.\n\nAfter considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to\nresolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous\nstandards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea\nand through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit\nprofessional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”\n\nl. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required\nEpstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an l8-Month Term of\nIncarceration\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a\nplea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.\nUSAM §8§ 9-27.33o, 9-27.4oo; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).\n2o6 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with\nprofessional ethics standards requiring that atorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a\nclient. Atorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires\nthe legal knouledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC\n4-l.l, 4-l.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an atorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but\ndoes not require the atorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-l.3\n(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those\ndecisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects\nexhibited sufficient knouledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA\nnegotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An atorney may\natain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the\nrequirements of the standard.\n\nl37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.tif": "record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023206.tif": "Lourie described the promise not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told\nOPR that he did not knou why it was included in the agreement, but added that it would be “unlike\nme if I read that language to just leave it in there unless I thought it was somehou helpful.” Lourie\nposited that victims who recruited other underage girls to provide massages for Epstein\n“theoretically” could have been charged as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw the\nprovision, he may have understood the reference to unnamed “co-conspirators” as “a message to\nany victims that had recruited other victims that there was no intent to charge them.”\n\nAcosta did not recall any discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he told\nOPR that Epstein was always “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed\nthe federal interests as vindicated as long as Epstein was required to face “meaningful\nconsequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR that when he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the\nextent I reviewed this co-conspirator provision, I can speculate that my thinking would have been\nthe focus is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some of his employees go to jail, or other,\nlesser involved [individuals], is not the focus of this.” Acosta also told OPR that he assumed\nVillafafia and Lourie had considered the provision and decided that it was appropriate. Finally,\nSloman, who was not involved in negotiating the NPA, told OPR that in retrospect, he understood\nthe non-prosecution provision was designed to protect Epstein’s four assistants, and it “never\ndawned” on him that it was intended to shield anyone else.\n\nThis broad provision promising not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is\ntroubling and, as discussed more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find evidence shouing that\nthe subjects gave careful consideration to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was\nwarranted given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete\ninformation regarding possible co-conspirators. Villafafia precipitously revised a more narrou\nprovision sought by the defense. Given its evolution from a provision sought by the defense, it\nappears unlikely to have been designed to protect the victims, and there is no indication that at the\ntime, the subjects believed that was the purpose. Houever, the USAO had not indicated interest\nin prosecuting anyone other than the four named female assistants, and OPR found no record\nindicating that Epstein had expressed concern about the prosecutive fate of anyone other than the\nfour assistants and unnamed employees of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR\nconcludes that the evidence does not shou that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia agreed to the non-\nprosecution provision to protect any of Epstein’s political, celebrity, or other influential\nassociates. 7”\n\nH. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein\n\nCooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment on\nThat Basis\n\nOne final issue OPR explored stemmed from media reports suggesting that Epstein may\nhave received special treatment from the USAO in return for his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in another federal\n242 As previously stated, Sloman was on vacation when Villafafia included the provision in draft plea agreements\nand did not monitor the case or comment on the various iterations of the NPA that were circulated during his absence.\nMenchel left the USAO on August 3, 2oo7, before the parties drafted the NPA.\n\nl68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.tif": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023213.tif": "Epstein’s state guilty plea.°° As U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the authority to resolve the case in\nthis manner, but OPR concludes that in light of all the surrounding circumstances, his decision to\ndo so reflected poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy principles was too expansive,\nhis view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too narrou, and his understanding of\nthe state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use the NPA.”>*!\n\nB. The Assessment of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was\n\nUndermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative\nSteps That Could Have Changed the Complexion of the Case\n\nThe leniency resulting from Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA is also\ntroubling because the USAO reached agreement on the terms of the NPA without fully pursuing\nevidence that could have changed the complexion of the case or afforded the USAO significant\nleverage in negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA was, in part, due to concerns about the merits of the case and\nconcems about whether the government could win at trial. Yet, Acosta made the decision to\nresolve the case through a state-based resolution and extended that proposal to Epstein’s defense\natorneys before the investigation was completed. As the investigation progressed, the FBI\ncontinued to locate additional victims, and many had not been interviewed by the FBI by the time\nof the initial offer. In other words, at the time of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not knou the\nfull scope of Epstein’s conduct; whether, given Epstein’s other domestic and foreign residences,\nhis criminal conduct had occurred in other locations; or whether the additional victims might\nimplicate other offenders. In addition, Villafafia planned to approach the female assistants to\natempt to obtain <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span>, but that step had not been taken.”°? Most importantly, Acosta ended\nthe investigation without the USAO having obtained an important category of potentially\nsignificant evidence: the computers removed from Epstein’s home prior to the PBPD’s execution\nof a search warrant.\n\nThe PBPD knew that Epstein had surveillance cameras stationed in and around his home,\nwhich potentially captured video evidence of people visiting his residence, and that before the state\n25o Acosta told OPR that he understood that if Epstein had pled to the original charges contemplated by the state,\nhe would have received a two-year sentence, and in that circumstance, the PBPD would not have brought the case to\nthe FBI. OPR was unable to verify that charges originally contemplated by the state would have resulted in a two-\nyear sentence. OPR’s investigation confirmed, houever, that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI because the PBPD\nChief was dissatisfied with the state’s handling of the mater.\n\n25l In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney stated that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR’s conclusion\nthat deferring prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein to the State Atorney rather than proceeding with a federal indictment or\na federal plea was, in hindsight, poor judgment.” Acosta also acknouledged that the USAO’s handling of the mater\n“would have benefited from more consistent staffing and atention. No one foresaw the additional challenges that the\nchosen resolution would cause. And the [NPA] relied too much on state authorities, who gave Epstein and his counsel\ntoo much wiggle-room.” Acosta’s counsel also noted that Acosta welcomed the public release of the Report, “did not\nchallenge OPR’s authority, welcomed the review, and cooperated fully.”\n\n252 Although the FBI interviewed numerous employees of Epstem and Villafafia identified three of his female\nassistants as potential co-conspirators, at the time that the USAO extended the terms of its offer, there had been no\nsignificant effort to obtain these individuals’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> against Epstein. The FBI atempted unsuccessfully to make\ncontact with two female assistants on August 27, 2oo7, as Epstein’s private plane was departing for the Virgin Islands,\nbut agents were unable to locate them on board the plane.\n\nl75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023222.tif": "which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue\na broader state indictment.\n\nOne example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 2o, 2oo7 email to Lourie\nasking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for\nEpstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea\nagreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I\ndidn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”\n(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie atached Acosta’s email and instructed\nVillafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkouitz].”\n(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that\nhe wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him knou” if they did not feel\ncomfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, houever, told OPR that she did not understand that\nshe was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted\nher to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his\ndeal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity\nto reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA\nbelieved she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself\nfrom the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.\n\nAs another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions\nbeing made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded\nrebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting\nVillafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could\nnot seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state\nresolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR\nthat he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with\nher if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any writen evidence of a meeting involving\nboth Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knouledgeable about the\nfacts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to\noffer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although\na U.S. Atorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel\npresented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware\nof Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°\n\nTwo logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers\ninvolved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the\noffices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,\nLourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior\n256 In her 2ol7 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining\nvictims’ <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the mater\nwas in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same\nconclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her\nOPR interview, houever, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that\nled to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—\nthat is, the NPA—which she did not support.\n\nl84\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023277.tif": "leter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]*”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\n372 Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\n\n373 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\n374 The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023302.tif": "continuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\na4 The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\n\n4l5 After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\n<span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n264\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.tif": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9.

Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate.

I have to say in this instance, your\noffice along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not\nadequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and\nprestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He\nlived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the\ncorrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be\nfacing the death penalty. Hou can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of\ngirls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and nou be a free man?! Hou?!! Because he is\nrich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these\ngirls makes me sick. Nou, I understand the pressure of taking on a pouerful person with\nunlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is beter than\nnone can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his <span class=\"highlight\">cooperation</span> nor\ndid you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your\noffice could have put this monster away for at least 2o years, if not life.\n\nI’m sure you have read Conchita Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this\nmonsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as\na cautionary tale on hou not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Nou,\nI do not knou the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, hou much hush’\nmoney was paid out, ect ect. But I do knou that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have\nraped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn’t be alloued to do the\nsame thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you\nlegally could have to put this man in prison. Houever after researching the case, it seems\nyou failed to come doun with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s\noffice and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!\nIt would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the\n\njustice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose\nto defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your litle sister\nor daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American\npeople deserve beter, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the\nanger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the\nwhole DA’s office nee“ to knou this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!\n\n-A Concerned Patriot\n\np.s.
