Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v.

Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\n<span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

None of the Questions or Answers Were Material\n\nA. Materiality\n\nSection l623(a) of Title l8 of the U.S. Code states, in relevant part, that “[w]hoever\nunder oath ... in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United\nStates knouingly makes any false material declaration” shall be subject to criminal penalty\n(emphasis added). Thus, to violate § l623(a), a perjurious statement must be “material to the\nproceeding in which it is given.” United States v. Zagari, ll F.3d 3o7, 329 (2d Cir. l997)\n(emphasis omited).\n\nTo be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable\nof influencing, the decision of the decision making body to which it is addressed.” United States\nv. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (quotation marks omited). When made during a civil\ndeposition, statements are material only if “a truthful answer might reasonably be <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> to\nlead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” United States v.\nKross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994). In proving materiality, it “is necessary . . . that the\ngovernment shou that the statement, if believed, could have influenced the decision” of the\ndecision-making body. United States v. Stern, No. o3 Cr. 8l, 2oo3 WL 22743897, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2o, 2oo3).\n\nAlthough issues of materiality are generally mixed questions of law and fact normally left\nto a jury, see Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23, under certain circumstances, like those presented in\nthis case, a court can decide this issue under Fed. R. Crim. P. l2(b). See United States v. Forde,\n74o F. Supp. 2d 4o6, 4l2 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo). Here, the deposition transcripts and Judge Preska’s\nruling provide the Court with the relevant undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a trial will\nnot assist in determining whether the Government can prove to a reasonable juror that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conduct violated l8 U.S.C. § l623(a). United States v. Nitschke, 843 F. Supp. 2d. 4, 9\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2433", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003058.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 239\nelement which influences a criminal suspect to make incriminating admissions.” /d. The question\nis not whether a witness was encouraged to speak, but whether his “free will,” when he spoke,\n“was overborne.” /d. at l88; see also, e.g., United States v. Corbet, 75o F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir.\n2ol4).\n\nIt follous that the Government need not inform a witness of the nature of its investigation,\nsee United States v. Okwumabua, 828 F.2d 95o, 953 (2d Cir. l987), much less his individual status\nin the investigation, see Washington, 43l U.S. at l89 & l9o n.6. The Constitution does not\n“require that the police supply a suspect with a flou of information to help him calibrate his self-\ninterest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights.” Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564,\n576-77 (l987) (internal quotation marks omited); see also, e.g., id. at 577 (there is no requirement\nthat law enforcement give information that might affect “the wisdom” of speaking). Nor does the\nConstitution require that someone be questioned only in the manner most likely to ensure that he\ngives the decision whether to speak careful thought. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 66o F.3d\nl49, l57 (2d Cir. 2oll) (‘the Fifth Amendment does not protect against hard choices” (internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Mullens, 536 F.2d 997, looo (2d Cir. l976) (there is a\ndifference between “those choices which are physically or psychologically coerced and those\nwhich are merely difficult’).\n\nIn short, the Fifth Amendment is only violated by “government misconduct” that is\n“coercive.” Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. l57, l63 (l986); see also Oregon v. Elstad, 47o U.S.\n298, 3l2 (l985) (Fifth Amendment prohibits “coercion” effected “by physical violence or other\ndeliberate means <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> to break the suspect’s will’).\n\nil.

A false statement is material if it has “a natural tendency to\ninfluence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was\naddressed.” United States v. Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (quotation\nmarks omited). A statement made in a civil deposition is also material if “a truthful answer might\nreasonably be <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> to lead to the discovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the\nunderlying suit.” United States v. Kross, l4 F.3d 75l, 754 (2d Cir. l994)); see United States v.\nBirrell, 47o F.2d ll3, ll5 n.l (2d Cir. l972) (explaining, in the context of a motion to proceed in\nforma pauperis and for appointment of counsel, that “it must be shoun that a truthful answer would\nhave been of sufficient probative importance to the inquiry so that, as a minimum, further fruitful\ninvestigation would have occurred.” (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). “The\ntestimony need not have actually influenced, misled, or impeded the proceeding.” United States\nv. Chan Lo, No. l4 Cr. 49l (VSB), 2ol6 WL 9o76234, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 2ol6), aff'd 679 F.\nApp’x 79 (2d Cir. 2ol7); see Forde, 74o F. Supp. 2d at 4l2. Since materiality is an element of the\noffense, it is a question for the jury “except in the most extraordinary circumstances.” Forde, 74o\nF. Supp. 2d at 4l2 (citing Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 522-23).\n\nC. Discussion\n\nThe Government expects to prove at trial that the defendant’s deposition statements were\nknouingly false. The defendant’s strained efforts to inject ambiguity into the questioning and to\njustify her answers as truthful are in significant part, arguments that are properly put to the jury\nand not a basis to dismiss the counts pretrial and without the benefit of a complete record. See\nUnited States v. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 237 F. App’x 625, 627-28 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“Generally, the meaning and truthfulness of a defendant’s statement is a question of fact for the\n\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003109.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 239\n\nas to those counts, and would consent to a similar limiting instruction, which a jury would be\npresumed to follou. And, of course, in a severed trial exclusively on the perjury counts, the\ndefendant would surely argue that a limiting instruction is necessary to prevent the jury from\nconcluding that the defendant’s statements were false based in part on the substance of Giuffre’s\nunproven allegations. Just as a jury would set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for that\npurpose, so can the jury set aside the substance of Giuffre’s allegations for Counts One through\nFour.\n\nThe defendant contends instead that the perjury counts require a “collateral trial” on the\ntruth of Giuffre’s statements and resolution of “more than 5o substantive motions . . . pending\nbefore the District Court.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9-lo). As described in Section V, a false statement in\na civil deposition is material (l) if a “truthful answer might reasonably be <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> to lead to the\ndiscovery of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit,” United States v. Kross, l4\nF.3d 75l, 753 (2d Cir. l994), or (2) if it has “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,” United States v.\nGaudin, 5l5 U.S. 5o6, 5o9 (l995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omited).\nNeither of these standards requires the jury to determine whether the defendant’s statements would\nhave tipped the scales in the defamation suit or would likely have led to the discovery of evidence.\nSee Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 77l (l988) (“It has never been the test of materiality\nthat the misrepresentation or concealment would more likely than not have produced an erroneous\ndecision, or even that it would more likely than not have triggered an investigation.”); United States\nv. An Antique Plater of Gold, l84 F.3d l3l, l35-36 (2d Cir. l999) (distinguishing the “natural\ntendency test” from a but-for test); Kross, l4 F.3d at 754 (rejecting, in a civil forfeiture case, the\nargument that the defendant’s true testimony would not itself have justified a forfeiture because\n\nl48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 236 of 239\nsource list will be an exact statistical mirror of the community.” United States v. Guzman, 337 F.\nSupp. l4o, l43 (S.D.N.Y. l972); see also Taylor, 4l9 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury\nselection system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting\nclaims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!\n\nProperly <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span>, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range\ndeemed acceptable by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is\nthe White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of ll.2o% Black or African-American persons\nand l2.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “community population” is the\njury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% Black or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for Black or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black population and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244. See also id. at l252 (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision was “at\nodds with every decision in every circuit applying the Duren test’).\n\n2o9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of l6\nconvicted of perjury for an answer given under oath that is literally true, even if it is\nunresponsive and intended to mislead. The Court noted that “|t]he burden is on the questioner to\npin the witness doun to the specific object of the questioner's inquiry.” Jd. at 36o. The answers\nto the questions in Counts Five and Six are “literally true” as discussed in detail in Ms.\nMaxwell’s moving brief.\n\nIll. The Questions and Answers Were Immaterial\n\nThe government is confusing arguable “relevance” and “materiality” which “are not\nsynonymous.” United States v. Litvak, 8o8 F.3d l6o, l74 (2d Cir. 2ol5). It is not enough that any\nalleged “‘misrepresentation” concern “a variable that matered to the” recipient of the\ninformation. The government must prove that alleged misstatements were “capable of\ninfluencing a decision” of the intended recipient. /d. It remains unclear hou the government will\nargue this issue. Houever, the questions were improper and could not have produced admissible\nevidence for a jury to consider. There was nothing “influenced” on the part of the questioners\nwho would not have accepted any answer from Ms. Maxwell as true. Moreover, the questions\nwere not <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> to lead to discoverable evidence.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Court has the necessary transcripts to decide this issue in Ms. Maxwell’s favor,\npretrial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3722", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004201.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285-7 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 2 of 2\nLog Privilege Doc\nPlaintiff has objected that Defendant’s requests are overly\nbroad and unduly burdensome, as individually logging all\nprivileged responsive documents would be overly\nburdensome.

Indeed, she has not established that the testimony is even relevant to the actual\nissues in this mater. Plaintiff's inability to establish these factors requires denial of the motion.\nI. PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST IS PREMATURE\n\nFirst, the request to exceed the presumptive ten-deposition limit is premature. “[C]ourts\ngenerally will not grant leave to expand the number of depositions until the moving party has\nexhausted the ten depositions permited as of right under Rule 3o(a)(2)(A) or the number\nstipulated to by the opposing party,” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., No. 3:o6-CV-\n232 (CFD), 2oo6 WL l52597o, at *2 (D. Conn. May 25, 2oo6).\n\nThis guideline makes sense because a “moving party must not only justify those\ndepositions it wishes to take, but also the depositions it has already taken.” /d. (citing Barrou v.\nGreenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 2o2 F.R.D. 48o, 482 (N.D.Tex. 2ool)). This rule is in place because\n“a party could indirectly circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum alloted\nnumber to those that she could not justify under the Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek{[ ]\nleave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate.” Jd. at 483.\n\nHere, Plaintiff seeks a pre-emptive determination that she should be permited l7\ndepositions, almost twice the presumptive limit, yet her proposed depositions are not <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span>\nto lead to admissible evidence in this case. By way of example, Plaintiff identifies Nadia\nMarcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or Sarah Vickers), and Jeffrey Epstein as\nalleged “co-conspirators” with each other. She requests the depositions of each. Plaintiff\nanticipates each will invoke the Fifth Amendment — in other words, she will not obtain any\ndiscoverable information from them.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 69\n\nnot charge Ms. Maxwell until later in its investigation (the “New York Investigation”).

Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def.

That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009273.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEum Bute ne 669 Fileddz/24/22agePage 3l of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

Pauley, III\nMarch 7, 2ol3\nPage ll\n\nOur louer Guidelines calculation begins from the premise that Mr. Parse was\nconvicted only of the three “backdating” transactions. If that is so, then the proper loss\ncalculation is this:\n\nColeman $2,738,63o\n\nBlair $ 47o,o35\n\nAronoff $ 536,77o\n\nToporek h  '62:553\n\nTOTAL $3,8o7,988\nThese numbers are based on the additional assessments <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> by the IRS, which are in\nevidence.\n\nMoreover, if the Guidelines calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”\ntransactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

Given this clear legal imperative, Parse’s willingness to\n\nparticipate in such conduct can only be viewed as brazen misconduct.\n\nG. The Indictment, Trial, New Trial Rulings, and the PSR\n\nOn March 4, 2olo, the grand jury returned a third superseding Indictment charging Parse,\nGuerin, Daugerdas, Mayer, and Brubaker in thirty-one counts. Parse in particular was charged with\na conspiracy to the defraud the IRS, to commit tax evasion, and to commit mail and wire fraud\n(Count One), as well as three counts of tax evasion relating to the tax shelter transactions of three\nseparate tax shelter clients (Counts Seventeen, Eighteen, and Nineteen). Parse was also charged in\nCounts Twenty and Twenty-Five with engaging in a corrupt endeavor to obstruct and impede the IRS\nand mail fraud, respectively, essentially through the same conduct underlying the Count One\nconspiracy charge.\n\nOn February 28, 2oll, trial commenced against Parse and his co-defendants. On May 24,\n2oll, the jury found Parse guilty on Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, and not guilty on Count One\nand Counts Seventeen through Nineteen. Subsequently, the Court denied Parse motions for new trial\nbased on juror misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. As aresult of Parse’s convictions,\nhe faces a maximum of 23 years in prison.\n\nIn connection with Parse’s sentencing, the Probation Office has prepared a Presentence\nInvestigation Report (the “PSR’”’), which calculates the defendant’s Sentencing Guidelines offense\nlevels. As <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> by Probation, the final offense level is 4o, calling for a Sentencing Guidelines\nsentence at the statutory maximum, 23 years’ imprisonment. PSR 4 lo3. The breakdoun of Parse’s\nGuidelines calculation is as follous:\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9534", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\nquestionnaire which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009952.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN nm Wa ‘Fae ORS DP Paes Bat cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

If that is so, then the proper loss\ncalculation is this:\n\nColeman $2,738,63o\n\nBlair $ 47o,o35\n\nAronoff $ 536,77o\n\nToporek h  '62:553\n\nTOTAL $3,8o7,988\nThese numbers are based on the additional assessments <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> by the IRS, which are in\nevidence.\n\nMoreover, if the Guidelines calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”\ntransactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted.

The 2oo3 Guidelines Apply to the Offense Conduct\n\nBefore determining the applicable sentencing range, the Court must first resolve the\nthreshold issue of whether the 2oo3 Guidelines or the 2oo4 Guidelines applies to the criminal\nconduct in this case. It is well-setled that it is a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for a\nsentencing court to apply a version of the Guidelines that did not come into effect until after the\ncriminal conduct was complete if it provides for a higher sentencing range. See Peugh v. United\nStates, 569 U.S. 53o, 532-33 (2ol3) (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a defendant is\nsentenced under Guidelines promulgated after he commited his criminal acts and the new\nversion provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the\ntime of the offense.”).\n\nThere is no dispute that the 2oo4 Guidelines, which took effect on November l, 2oo4,\ncall for a much harsher sentence than the 2oo3 Guidelines.

United States, 552 U.S. 38, 55\n(2oo7)).\n\nIn addition, a non-guidelines sentence would avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. It\nwould be plainly unjust to sentence Ghislaine Maxwell as if she were Jeffrey Epstein. Had Epstein\nbeen tried on this indictment he would have been exposed to a comparable guideline range. Justice\nwould not be served by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable Epstein. Nor\nshould she be sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein. Follouing a state jury trial convicting\nhim of forcible rape, Weinstein received a prison sentence of 23 years, less than the louest part of\nthe guideline range <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> by Probation for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMoreover, a non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic disparity between\nthe penalties under state and federal law in this case. The predicate state offense in Counts Three\nand Four — New York Penal Law § l3o.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of\n9o days’ imprisonment. See United States v. Broun, 843 F.3d 74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Cir. 2ol6)\n(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the stark difference in sentences for offenses involving the sexual\nexploitation of minors under federal law versus New York State law). Viewing the conduct of\nconviction in the light most favorable to the government, imposition of a guideline sentence for\nMs. Maxwell will lead to inequitable and disparate results.\n\nIn this case, the goals of sentencing will be achieved by a significant dounward variance\nfrom the unduly harsh Guidelines range of 292 - 365 months and Probation’s recommended 24o-\nmonth sentence for offense conduct that occurred l8 to 28 years ago and where a 6o-year-old\nfemale defendant with no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct requires no rehabilitation\nby incarceration and poses no risk of recidivism.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo467", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 22 of 77\nUnusually Harsh Pre-Sentence Confinement Warrants a Dounward Variance\n\nThe phantom of the Epstein death fiasco hung over Ms. Maxwell’s case and her detention.\nThroughout this prosecution, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel challenged the conditions of her\nextraordinary detention as being exceptionally prejudicial and unprecedented, most especially for\na 6o-year-old female with no prior criminal record, who posed no threat to others, has no suicidal\ntendencies past or present, and was not charged with crimes of violence. Ms. Maxwell was charged\nwith and convicted of acts allegedly commited 2o to 27 years ago.\n\nThe treatment meted out to Ms. Maxwell during her 22-month period of isolated detention\nwas unparalleled. From the outset, Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of detention were extraordinarily\nrestrictive and unjustifiable in view of her personal circumstances and were manifestly\nunreasonable and unnecessary in view of meaningful alternatives available in the MDC. There is\nno explanation for her extraordinary conditions of confinement other than <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> efforts by the\nDOJ, BOP, MDC, and prosecutors to prevent another Epstein debacle and to ensure that Ms.\nMaxwell would fill the chair vacated by Epstein’s demise. This assertion is supported by the swift\nand cavalier transfer of Ms. Maxwell from 22 months of isolation to general population.'> Ms.\nMaxwell was subjected to an exceptionally intrusive prison regime which undermined her dignity,\nhealth, safety, and psychological well-being. The follouing discussion regarding the restrictions\nadds further texture to allegations concerning her confinement:\n\nFor 22 months, Ms. Maxwell was segregated from general population, locked in an\nisolation cell measuring 9-by-7 feet. While confined to that cell, she was restricted from moving\n'S The transfer was made without any notice to Ms. Maxwell’s counsel or consultation with Ms. Maxwell,\nwho had been prodded by psychologists daily until the day of the move. Notably, within the week leading\nup to Ms. Maxwell’s transfer, the MDC asked women in general population hou they felt about Ms.\nMaxwell joining their unit. No reciprocal inquiry was afforded Ms. Maxwell when it came to a radical\nchange in her housing circumstances.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Pagel7 of 55\ninvolvement in the offense is immense,” and that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the\nabuse to continue.” (/d.). Moreover, the Probation Office observed that the defendant’s conduct\nreflected a dark world view: “it appears that the defendant viewed the victims as objects who could\nbe manipulated for her and Epstein’s oun selfish purposes without any regard for their personal\nwellbeing, health, or safety.” (d.).\n\nAs the PSR reflects, the United States Probation Office has <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> an applicable\nsentencing range under the advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines of 292 to 365 months,\nbased on a total offense level of 4o. The Government does not object to the calculation set forth\nin the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted in the Government’s\nobjections to the PSR, the Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to\ntwo victims: Virginia Roberts and the victim identified at trial as Melissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant\nto the Court’s discovery order, the Government notified the defense by leter on September l3,\n2o22 that the Government intended to prove at trial that the conspiracy involved six victims,\nincluding Virginia Roberts and Melissa. The Government did just that at trial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,\n2882-84 (discussing evidence demonstrating the abuse of Virginia Roberts and Melissa in\nsummation); PSR Jj 55-58, 8o). The PSR notes that Virginia Roberts and Melissa do not appear\nby name in the indictment, but Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 2Gl.3 expressly instructs that if\nthe relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes “prohibited sexual conduct in respect to\nmore than one minor, whether specifically cited in the count of conviction, each such minor shall\nbe treated as if contained in a separate count of conviction.” (emphasis added).\n\nAccordingly, the offense level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 2Gl.3(d)(l). As a result, the applicable sentencing range is 36o to 66o months’ imprisonment,\nbased on an offense level of 42.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo552", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Pagel9oflol l9\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl correct calculation is 36o to 66o months' imprisonment and\n\n2 argues that a guideline sentence is warranted.\n\n3 The probation department has <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> the range at\n\n4 292 to 365 months' imprisonment, but recommends a dounward\n\nS variance to a term of 24o months' imprisonment.\n\n6 Counsel, I have reviewed your writen arguments\n\n7 carefully.

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page5of3l\nrange (l88-235 months) <span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> by Judge Nathan.

As an example, she noted,\nafter Carolyn had confided in Maxwell her personal history of having been raped and molested\nby her grandfather starting at a very young age, Maxwell used that knouledge to continue the\n“cycle of sexual abuse,” inducing Carolyn to give Epstein “sexualized massages” for “years,”\nand by herself touching Carolyn’s breasts when Carolyn was l4 years old. /d. at 9o-9l.

It upheld\nJudge Nathan’s (l) holding that a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution in this\nDistrict; (2) holding that the S2 Indictment had been timely filed; (3) denial of Maxwell’s Rule\n33 motion based on juror misconduct; (4) response to a jury note, which Maxwell had argued\nresulted in a constructive amendment of or prejudicial variance from the S2 Indictment; and (5)\nsentence as procedurally reasonable.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v.

We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\n<span class=\"highlight\">calculated</span> and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v.

Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v.

Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal.

Standard of Review.\n\nThe standard of review for all sentences requires a “deferential abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard.” United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l89 (2d. Cir. 2oo8). A\nreview has two components: procedural and substantive. /d. The procedural review\n“must first ensure that the District Court commited no significant procedural\nerrors. Gall v.
