She found her passion in life at aged 5o, when she poured\nher heart and soul into seting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The\nTerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and\npublishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities\nand organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.\nThese recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,\nwhich is hou they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each alloued their logos/names to be associated\non the public TerraMar website.\n\nGhislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her\nconcern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close doun the\nProject was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be\nvilified by the Press after her arrest. I knou that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways\nto give back to society.\nWe live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’\nsocial position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms\nwith gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her\npositions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to\nget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work\nwas a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every\ntime they reference her.\nIam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain\nfreedom while she still has all her faculties, [ knou she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest\nof what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the\npoints in my leter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her\ntruly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.\nRespectfully,\nCHRISTINE MALINA MAXWELL\nll42o Santa Monica Blvd. #25424\nLos Angeles, CA 9oo25\n\nPage 2 of 2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo495\n"};
