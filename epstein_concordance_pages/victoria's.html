I was told by a booker that I needed to meet\n\n7 with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the ouner of\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">Victoria's</span> Secret.

So I went one day in the afternoon and I met\n\nl2 Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman\nl3 introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be\n\nl4 extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would\nl5 probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away.\nl6 The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey\nl7 Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we\n\nl8 chated very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he\n\nl9 didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got\n2o close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked.\n2l I didn't knou what was going on. It was my first\n22 official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a\n23 young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a\n24 skirt on. He started to touch my genitals. I refused him.\n25 Then he went to the massage table and shoued me the vibrator.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo722", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000723.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 85 of 86 85\nJ8RSEPS3\n\nl IT took it and threw it at him.\n\n2 At that point, I ran to the door again and figured out\n3 hou to get out of there. A girl outside asked me where I was\n\n4 going and she said to be careful. She said that Mr. Epstein\n\n5 knew a lot of pouerful people, including Bill Clinton, and that\n6 if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to\n7 have any job in the industry.\n\n8 I was so scared.
