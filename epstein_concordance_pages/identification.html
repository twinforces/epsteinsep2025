Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001523.jpg": "Casese@:2(2OrroeGGO32INo Damtument@ AietO/G2o Regpe2batB3\nstate.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 4 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false. The protective order in the Epstein case included\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool667", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001668.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 5 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\na provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals\nwho had spoken on the public record in /itigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

There, the district court dismissed an indictment in a child enticement case for\ninsufficiency of the evidence.

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003598.jpg": "Case l:25-cvOo423G4RAP Dodooureenti264-l6 FHdddlOA/2?67/2l Pagagk83Dol435\nPage 384\nl G Maxwell - Confidential\n2 Jeffrey that was under the age of l8?\n3 MR.

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004997.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 32o Filed o8/l8/2l Page4of4\nHonorable Alison J.

Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)).

The court said in addition that “[a] common trial tactic of defense lawyers\nis to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant, and we may\nconsider such use in assessing a possible Brady violation.” Jd. But the Court did not say that any\nand all evidence that went to the diligence of the Government’s investigators or prosecutors is\nadmissible.\n\nThe reason is that litigating whether the investigators were sufficiently thorough is not a\ndefense. The rule is that the Government is not on trial—the law does not permit the defense to\noffer evidence solely to atack the Government’s motives or thoroughness. To the extent the\ndefense may do so, they may do so in closing argument, see United States v. Londono, l75 F.\nApp’x 37o, 375 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (explaining that “a defendant may comment on\nthe failure of proof in the record’), through relevant cross-examination, see Watson, 64o F.3d at\n5ll, and through evidence that is otherwise relevant, see Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445, 453 (defense\ncould have called informant whose “behavior raised suspicions that he had planted both the murder\nweapon and the victim’s purse in the places they were found”). See also United States v. Mickens,\nNos. 2o-258 (L), 2o-462, 2o-63o, 2o2l WL 3l36o83, at *9 (2d Cir.

These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure.

Init, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (2)\n2\n(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the\nconclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the\nevidence's admission \"[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence.\" Jd. The Leter\nlacked <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked\nany \"basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose.\"\n\nAlso on October ll, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick\nreview of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents\nand other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy.\n\nSee, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2oo5); GX-423 (an\nAmazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2ol3); GX-5ol & 5o2\n(financial statements from June 2oo7); GX-66l & 662 (flight logs from 2oo5-l3). None of these\nitems of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 4o4(b) Leter.

Raheem v.

In the context\nof a photo array, familiar examples of a suggestive presentation include the “use of a very small\nnumber of photographs,” “the use of suggestive comments,” or the display of the accused’s\nphotograph in a way that “so stood out from all of the other photographs as to suggest to an\nidentifying witness that that person was more likely to be the culprit.” United States v.\nConcepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 377 (2d Cir. l992).\n\nDe | 2° photo looks like a mug shot, is\ndifferent than the others, and the manner in which it was presented was unduly suggestive.\n\nWhere, as here, pretrial procedures have been unduly suggestive, the court must\ndetermine whether an in-court <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> will be the product of the suggestive procedures or\nwhether instead it is independently reliable. The factors to be considered include “the\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness! degree of\natention, the accuracy of the witness' prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty\ndemonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and\nthe confrontation.” Neil v.

Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2).

Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5849", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005850.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive.

Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly suggestive about the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure was not suggestive because it was merely a\n“confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and identified by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4.

She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

(See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F.

Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened.

The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them. The defendant’s arguments regarding relevance and Rule 4o3, houever, are\nmeritless, and the Court should deny them.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIn general, “[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what\nthe proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The Second Circuit has made clear that “the bar\nfor authentication of evidence is not particularly high.” United States v. El Gammal, 83l F. App’x\n539, 542 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). Rule 9ol is “satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable\njuror could find in favor of authenticity or <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>,” E/ Gammal, 83l F. App’x at 542\n(quoting United States v. Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4)), and such “proof of\nauthentication may be direct or circumstantial,” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (citations and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nFor instance, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\norder), the defendant challenged the authenticity of “handwriten leters that were found in a USB\ndrive that was handed to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” J/d. at\n24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge. “Although the Government did not present\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005858.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\nDetective Recarey—is dead.

The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both Detective Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 45\nAlaggia et al. 279\nTable 2.

Disclose, as to the\nactual statements, according to the government, means “produced” at some time in the past or to\nbe produced in the future, perhaps as an oral statement during trial.\n\nOf course, the Court will tell the parties whether it meant two completely different things\nwhen it used the same word, as argued by the government, or whether it intended for the\ngovernment to disclose the statements it intends to offer as co-conspirator statements. To avoid\ndelay over this issue during trial, Ms. Maxwell suggests that she cannot litigate this issue in\nadvance of trial without knouing what statements are being offered under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 8ol(d)(2)(e).\n\nWhat is clear from the government’s response is not that it misunderstood the Order, but\nrather, it continues to disagree with the Order.\n\nB. The Court Has the Authority to Require Disclosure\n\nSecond, doubling doun on its disagreement with the Court, the government claims “‘t is\naware of no such case” in which a court ordered the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of anticipated co-conspirator\nstatements prior to trial.

Only two\nof the photos look anything like Ms. Maxwell and ggg thought one was Ms. Maxwell\nand the other might be Ms. Maxwell. Of course, no one thought to ask if her\nlawyers had shoun her photos of Ms. Maxwell as part of her multi-million-dollar request or if\nshe had seen any of the many photographs displayed on the internet of Ms. Maxwell, including\nthose published in relation to the first indictment by Acting U.S. Atorney Strauss’s Rule 23.l-\nviolative press conference, or any of the millions of photographs published in the wake of the\nIndictment. The photo array process was not recorded, and we do not knou why certain photos\nin the array were selected or by whom. No one documented hou long the photo array was\nviewed or any other relevant indicia of reliability.\n\nThe claim that the shou-up was merely a “confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” of someone that\nBE ad “knoun and identified by name over the years” is completely unsupported by\nthe evidence. Tellingly, the government appends no supporting exhibit or declaration in support\nof this conclusory statement because it cannot. The truth of the mater is that yg had\nnever identified Ms. Maxwell as someone who abused her and never claimed to have seen Ms.\nMaxwell prior to 2o2o when it became economically prudent for her to do so.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5994", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 52\n\nThe facts about J interaction with Ms. Maxwell are hotly disputed. Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5995", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 52\ncriminal, (4) the certainty with which the witness first identified the suspect, and (5) the time\nlapse between the crime and the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>. /d. at ll86. Each of these factors weighs heavily\nin Ms. Maxwell’s favor: as to l-3, until 2o2o 3g had never claimed Ms. Maxwell\nparticipated in any abuse and never identified Ms. Maxwell -- indeed, she had never before been\nasked to identify Ms. Maxwell. Concerning number 4 J was less than certain, as\ndemonstrated by her selection of someone else who may have been “Ms. Maxwell.” Factor 5\nalso weighs in Ms. Maxwell’s favor, as the delay was l7 years.\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court hold an evidentiary hearing on this\nmotion and find that the shou up was unduly suggestive and suppress any <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of Ms.\nMaxwell, before or during trial.\n\nVIH. GOVERNMENT AGREES NOT TO ELICIT LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\nOPINION TESTIMONY\n\nThe government agrees that it has not noticed any law enforcement officers as experts\nand, as to their fact police officers, \"will not elicit expert testimony from them.\" Resp. at 82-83.\nOverlooking the long list of potential law enforcement opinion testimony that has been\ndisalloued by Courts in the past (see Mot. at 2-5), the government then goes on to make the\nconfusing claim that the defense should have to \"provide expert\" testimony from the\ngovernment's oun case agents if it wants to call them as witnesses. Resp. at 83 n.24.\n\nThe defense has no intention of eliciting opinion testimony from the agents when they\ntestify. As the motion makes clear, the defense fully understands the contours of lay versus\nopinion testimony from law enforcement officers. The case agents are first hand percipient\nwitnesses to a number of facts in the investigation and prosecution of this case, including as the\nimpeachment witness for the many changed stories of the accusers.\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5996", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006002.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 52\nprejudice because the [witness's] choice of language implied that he and the prosecution believed\nthe complainant's testimony.\" Jd.\n\nFor these and the previously stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to order that the\nparties, the witnesses, and the Court use individuals’ names in the presence of the jury.\nXIU. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF GOVERNMENT\nEXHIBITS 52, 25l, 288, 294, 3l3, 6o6 AND THE SEARCH OF EL BRILLO WAY\nA. The Court Should Exclude the Challenged Government Exhibits\nRule 9ol(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that “[t]he requirement\nof authentication or <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by\nevidence sufficient to support a finding that the mater in question is what its proponent\nclaims.” See also Rickets v. City of Hartford, 74 F.3d l397, l4o9 (2d Cir.l996); United States v.\nSliker, 75l F.2d 477, 496-5oo (2d Cir.l984) (discussing the interaction between\nFed.R.Evid. lo4 and 9ol). “In order for a piece of evidence to be of probative value, there must\nbe proof that it is what its proponent says it is. The requirement of authentication is thus a\ncondition precedent to admiting evidence.” United States v. Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 497 (2d Cir.\nl984). A motion in limine to preclude evidence calls on the \"[C]ourt to make a preliminary\ndetermination on the admissibility of evidence under Rule lo4 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence.” Highland Capital Mgmt., L.P. v.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3..\n\n5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses\n\nDr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility\nof witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an\nallegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.\nIndeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific\nexpert testimony instructing the jury in hou to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears litle or no relationship to\naccuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the\ntask of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her\nconfidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.\n\nSimilarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details\nof the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at lo), also invades the province of the jury.\nHou to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of\nwitnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, l92 F.3d at 289. The\nGovernment expects that the Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, and having one party’s witness lay doun a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make\nit more difficult for the jurors to follou the Court’s instructions. See, e.g., Hygh, 96l F.2d at 364.\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006241.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3o of 4l\n\n2. “[Hlou memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.”\n\n3. “[T]he mechanism by which false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result\nof post-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence or the like.”\n\n4. “(T]he effects of suggestion on memory,” including hou “[s]uggestive activities can\nexplain hou it is that a person might go from having no memory of sexual abuse, and even denying\nsexual abuse, to later having [memories] for numerous abusive acts, if the memories are false.”\n\n5. “[T] he characteristics of false and/or distorted memories” . . . “[i]n particular,” that:\n\na.

As set forth belou, the Government objects that some of these\nopinions (paragraphs l, 2, 5(b), and 6) are commonsense principles within the ken of the jury;\nsome (paragraphs 5(a) and 5(b)) invade the province of the jury in assessing witness credibility\nand demeanor; some (paragraphs 6 and 7) are vehicles to insert factual narrative about the case;\nand some (paragraph 3) are unreliable and lack fit with the case.\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, memory, perception, and the fallibility of human recall—that is, hou\npeople may remember, misremember, or forget past events—are within the ken of the jury.

See, e.g., United States v.

A at l).!!\n\nMoreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to\nfalse memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United\nStates v. Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at 8-l8. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research\nregarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in\na 2oo6 article. See id. at lo-ll (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.\nLoftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46\nJurimetrics J. l77-2l4 (2oo6)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the\ndesign of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at ll. The court\nfound that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical\nsituations involving eyewitness <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court\nalso found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part\n“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at l6.\nThe Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled\nlaboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation\nof false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI\n'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also\nexplained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating\nindividuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr.\nRocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have\nexperienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. A at 2). The Government also produced\nits notes from its interviews with Dr. Rocchio simultaneously with its expert notice. The defense\nexpert notice identifies no particular form of training, experience, or research on which Dr. Loftus\nis relying, nor has the defense produced any notes of its conversations with Dr. Loftus.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6246", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 38 of 4l\nis a tautology that someone who has a false memory—that is, unknouingly misremembers\nsomething—believes it to be accurate. Otherwise it would not be a memory.\n\n3. Opinions Bearing on Witness Credibility and Demeanor\n\nThe follouing opinions by Dr. Loftus invade the province of the jury by atempting to\ninstruct it on hou to assess witness credibility and demeanor:\n\ne Hou an individual with a false memory can describe that memory “with confidence, detail\nand emotion,” as described in Paragraph 5(a) above.\ne Hou an individual with a false memory is “not deliberately lying,” as described in\n\nParagraph 5(b) above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from opining on victim or witness credibility, including by\nopining as to hou a victim with an alleged false memory may testify (e.g., confidently) and\ndescribing a victim with an alleged false memory as a “liar” or “not a deliberate liar.’ Such\nopinions would be highly prejudicial and inflammatory, would confuse and mislead the jury, and\nwould invade the fundamental province of the jury in determining witness credibility. See\nLumpkin, l92 F.3d at 288-89 (affirming district court’s exclusion of expert testimony that a\nwitness’s confidence does not correlate to the witness’s factual accuracy in the context of an\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> because such testimony “might confuse or mislead the jury”); Shohola, 2ol9 WL\n6o53223, at *lo-l3 (discussing jury’s province of determining witness credibility); Fed. R. Evid.\n4o3. Such opinions, moreover, are effectively defense arguments to be appropriately made during\ndefense summations. To allou Dr. Loftus to testify that a victim is essentially a liar (but may not\nrealize she is a liar) or that a witness may testify confidently even when testifying untruthfully\nwould effectively allou the defense to cloak its arguments under the imprimatur of a purported\nexpert. The Court will instruct the jury on witness credibility. A defense expert should not provide\na dueling instruction.

Factual Narratives About the Case\n\nThe follouing opinions are objectionable vehicles for factual narrative about the case:\n\ne <span class=\"highlight\">Identification</span> of “some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case,” as\ndescribed in Paragraph 6 above.\n\ne Hou, “in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the construction of\ndistorted memories,” as described in Paragraph 7 above.\n\nDr. Loftus should be precluded from embedding a factual narrative about the case in her\nopinions. Dr. Loftus has not evaluated any of the victims in this case. Unlike Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus\ndoes not even describe what case-specific materials she has reviewed. (Cf Ex. A at 3 (“Atached\nas Exhibit C [and Exhibit B to this motion] is a list of material reviewed by Dr. Dietz.”)). Dr.\nLoftus thus has no basis to comment on whether or not certain “suggestive activities” may have\ninfluenced any of the victims before the jury, much less a basis to shou that she has “reliably\napplied [her] principles and methods of the facts of the case.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2. Any such\nopinions from Dr. Loftus regarding the facts of this particular case would thus lack any scientific\nbasis, would be extremely prejudicial, and would mislead the jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, 7o3,\n4o3; see also, e.g., Island Intell. Prop., 2ol2 WL 526722, at *2 (“It is also inappropriate for experts\nto act as... vehicles for factual narrative... .”).\n\nTW. IF DEFENSE CHALLENGES TO DR. ROCCHIO ARE ACCEPTED, THE\n\nDEFENSE EXPERTS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED\n\nIt bears noting that neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony can survive the\ndefense’s oun understanding of the reliability requirements of Daubert.

Engle and W. O'’Donohue\nthat lack clear corroborating evidence, an understanding of pathways to\nfalse allegations may be useful to help determine the accuracy of the claims.\n\nBinder and McNeil (2oo7) presented several civil cases in which the\nalleged perpetrator of sexual assault and/or boundary violations completely\ndenied all wrongdoing, and there was no corroborating evidence to help\nverify the claims of either party. The authors contended that in cases such\nas these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations\nmay provide a context for allegations by allouing the court to understand\npersonality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic\nsymptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-\nlogical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating\naccounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-\ncal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when\ninteracting with others, tendency touard exaggeration, and serious cognitive\nproblems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be\nseveral additional psychological markers to consider when determining the\ncredibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of\nthese pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding\nthe role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo),\nin explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be\nassociated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these\nvariables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual\nwith borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,\ntherefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as\nwe discuss belou, the individual with borderline personality disorder may\nalso suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.\nWe caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is\nthe case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-\ngations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic\nmental health professional to understand these pathways in context with\nthe alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would\nmean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; houever, mental\nhealth professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-\nways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present\npaper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual\nassault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false\nallegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the\nmisuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific\naccusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively\nand accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations l23\n\nSetrakian, L.

Discussion\n\nThe defense should be precluded from offering evidence or making arguments about (l)\nthe fact that the USAO-SDFL entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in 2oo8; or\n(2) the fact that the USAO-SDNY first indicted Epstein alone in 2ol9 before it indicted the\ndefendant. Such evidence is irrelevant, would confuse and mislead the jury, and calls for\nhearsay.\n\nFirst, those facts are irrelevant. These charging decisions say nothing at all about guilt or\ninnocence and fail to make more or less probable any fact of consequence. Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is irrelevant\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6385", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 4o\n“cross-examined the detectives” about the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure and “pointed out that [the\ndefendant] was charged even though he had a confirmed alibi and [the alternative perpetrator] did\nnot.” 799 F.2d at 6l3.

But the Court did not say that any\nand all evidence that went to the diligence of the Government’s investigators or prosecutors is\nadmissible.\n\nThe reason is that litigating whether the investigators were sufficiently thorough is not a\ndefense. The rule is that the Government is not on trial—the law does not permit the defense to\noffer evidence solely to atack the Government’s motives or thoroughness.

These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating disclosure.

This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 4o4(b)\nevidence and notice” by October ll.

The\nGovernment asserted in the Leter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct\nevidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 4o4(b) as proof of the\ndefendant's intent, preparation, plan, knouledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)\naccident.” /d. at2.

For the reasons that follou, the defendant’s\nmotions should be denied.\n\nFirst, the Government has given notice of a qualified expert who will provide reliable and\nrelevant opinions, as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 7o2 and Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993). (See Def. Mot. 3). Second, evidence relating to\nMinor Victim-3 is admissible both as direct evidence of the charged crimes, and admissible in the\nalternative under Rule 4o4(b). (See Def. Mot. 4). Third, the Government has provided adequate\nnotice pursuant to Rule 4o4(b), and in any event, all evidence for which it has provided such notice\nis also admissible as direct evidence of the charged crimes. (See Def. Mot. 2). Fourth, there is no\nbasis to preclude the introduction of co-conspirator statements under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E).\n(See Def. Mot. l). Fifth, Minor Victim-4’s confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant was not\nunduly suggestive, and it should not be suppressed. (See Def. Mot. 9). Sixth, the Government’s\nvarious exhibits are relevant, and the Government will authenticate them at trial. (See Def. Mots.\n7, 8, l3). Seventh, it is entirely proper for the word “victim” and for discussion of rape to be used\nin a trial about the sexual exploitation of minor victims. (See Def. Mots. ll, l2). Eighth, and\nfinally, the Government does not intend to offer evidence of the defendant’s flight, her false\nexculpatory statements, or law enforcement expert testimony in its case in chief, unless the\ndefendant opens the door or otherwise puts this evidence in issue. (See Def. Mots. 5, 6, lo).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 84\n(“Since its introduction to the peer-reviewed professional literature in l984, the term ‘grooming’\nhas become so widely adopted that it will remain in widespread use for decades to come.”);\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse: Conceptual and\nMeasurement Issues,” 23 J.

The Supreme Court found the discovery\nviolation was “both willful and blatant.” Jd. at 4l6. Taylor does not support the defense’s position.\nThe defense, citing Zaylor, accuses the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September\n3, 2o2l Order. (See Def. Mot. l at 6-7; see id. at 3 (accusing the Government of “atempting to\noverstuff an already full sandbag”’)). The Government did no such thing. The Government has\nsimply read the word “disclose” to mean “disclose,” consistent with the uniform practice in this\nDistrict. The defense’s accusations are baseless and offensive.\n\nThe defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.\nThey have these records “unusually early”—seven weeks before trial. (Endorsed Leter at 3, Dkt.\nNo. 353). The defense also knous the identities of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom\nthe Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance that makes the defense’s task\neven easier. And they are free to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during trial. The\nGovernment has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped to prepare for\ntrial. The Court should deny the motion.\nV. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">Identification</span> of the Defendant\nThe defendant claims that Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of her was unduly suggestive\nand should be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That argument finds support in neither fact nor law.\nMinor Victim-4 knew the defendant personally, and she has consistently described the defendant\nfor decades. The <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was not suggestive, and the motion should be denied.\nA.

FT\neer\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nAs a general mater, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on\nevidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by\naffording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as\nunworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2ol2). Eyewitness\nidentifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that\nwas “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable\nmisidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, ll2-l4 (l977); Simmons\nv. United States, 39o U.S. 377, 384 (l968).\n\nFederal courts follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>\nevidence. Perry, 565 U.S. at 238-4o; Brisco v. Ercole, 565 F.3d 8o, 88 (2d Cir. 2oo9). First, the\ndefendant must shou that the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to\nirreparable mistaken <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that [the defendant] was denied due process of law.” United\nStates v. DiTommaso, 8l7 F.2d 2ol, 2l3 (2d Cir. l987) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomited); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l34 (2d Cir. 2ool). This is a high threshold to meet,\nas the defendant must shou that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial\n\n65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6774", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006775.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6/7 of 84\nlikelihood of irreparable misidentification.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934,\n973 (2d Cir. l99o). If the defendant cannot make such a shouing, “the trial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>\ntestimony is generally admissible without further inquiry into the reliability of the pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>. In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> evidence. See Brathwaite, 432 U.S. at llo-l4. Instead, the court must then\ndetermine whether the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> evidence is nevertheless “independently reliable” based on\nthe totality of the circumstances. Brisco, 565 F.3d at 89; United States v. Simmons, 923 F.2d 934,\n95o (2d Cir. l99l) (“[E]ven a suggestive out-of-court <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> will be admissible if, when\nviewed in the totality of the circumstances, it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.”). Among\nthe factors to be considered are: “the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of\nthe crime, the witness’ degree of atention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the\ncriminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of\ntime between the crime and the confrontation.” Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, l99-2oo (l972).\nNo single factor is dispositive. See Kelly, 257 F.3d at l35.\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6775", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 68 of 84\nC. Discussion\n\nThere was nothing unduly suggestive about the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure used here.\nAccordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant, and\nMinor Victim-4 should be permited to identify the defendant at trial.'”\n\nFirst, the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure was not suggestive because it was merely a\n“confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” of a person Minor Victim-4 had knoun and identified by name over\nthe years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” by shouing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo\narray or photo book. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. lo Cr. ll23 (JSR), 2oll WL 7782582\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2oll) (“Displaying a confirmatory photograph of a person the witness has\nindicated that he already knous is perfectly acceptable.”); Gilbert v. Sup’t of Collins Corr. Fac.,\nNo. o3 Civ. 3866 (LBS), 2oo4 WL 287683, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

Wood, No. o4 Civ. 47l4 (RLM), 2oo6 WL 84238o, at *ll (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2oo6)\n(collecting cases).\n\nMinor Victim-4’s personal knouledge of the defendant is well established. The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she recognized anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does. And it is\nnot in fact different from the others: While the defendant’s photo is louer resolution than some,\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6777", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7o of 84\nthere are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,\nthese highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should\nbe denied on this basis, and the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> should be admited at trial, where the defendant will\nhave a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination\nand atorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no shouing\nof suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>] goes to the weight of\nthe evidence, not its admissibility”).\n\nEven if the “confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the\ndefendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> had clear independent\nreliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous\ninteractions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed\nquestion about a confirmatory <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for\nthe in-court <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was so clear. See Wiggins, l32 F. App’x 86l, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2oo5)\n(witness saw defendant at distance of 5o feet under “streetlight illumination” but was familiar with\ndefendant from seeing him previously in neighborhood); accord United States v. Lumpkin, l92\nF.3d 28o, 288 (2d Cir. l999) (officers’ in-court identifications reliable where officers had\nunobstructed views of the defendant selling narcotics on two occasions, one of which was during\ndaylight at close range); United States v. Crumble, No. l8 Cr. 32 (ARR), 2ol8 WL l737642, at *2\n(E.D.N.Y. Apr. ll, 2ol8) (collecting cases finding that “in-court <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> is [] admissible,\ndespite an improper pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure, if the witness is familiar with the defendant\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6778", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006779.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7l of 84\nprior to the incident,” or alternatively, if “if a witness gets a good look at the defendant during the\ncourse of a crime”); United States v. Reed, No. ll Cr. 487 (RJS), 2ol2 WL 2o53758, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y. June 6, 2ol2) (noting that a “witness’s familiarity with a suspect may establish that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> . . . is independently reliable”).\n\nThis is not a crime in which a victim captures a fleeting glance of the perpetrator. Minor\nVictim-4 interacted with the defendant personally on multiple occasions between 2ool and 2oo4.\nShe knew the defendant by name and gave a description. In the totality of the circumstances, it is\nplain that Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant is sufficiently independently reliable to\npermit the jury to decide its persuasiveness.\n\nThe defense merely replies, again in conclusory fashion, that Minor Victim-4 (l) never\nidentified the defendant as an abuser, (2) did not have an opportunity to view her during the crime\nbecause the defendant was not involved in a crime, (3) never described the defendant, and (4) the\ntime between the abuse and the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> was extraordinarily long. (Def. Mot. 9 at 4). The\nfirst three of these points are inaccurate, as set forth above. And the delay in time is untroubling\ngiven Minor Victim-4’s contacts with the defendant and consistent references in the intervening\ntime. The defense is free to atempt to argue these points to the jury, but none of these arguments\nsupports a motion to suppress Minor Victim-4’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant.\n\nMinor Victim-4 knous who participated in the sexual abuse she experienced, as she has\nfor the decades since it happened. This Court should deny the motion.\n\n7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6779", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 72 of 84\nVI. The Court Should Deny the Defense Motions to Preclude the Government’s\nExhibits\n\nThe defense has filed several motions to preclude certain Government exhibits. (Def.\nMots. 7, 8, and l3). The Court should deny the defense authentication arguments without prejudice\nbecause the Government expects its witnesses will be able to authenticate the exhibits at trial\nbefore it offers them. The defendant’s arguments regarding relevance and Rule 4o3, houever, are\nmeritless, and the Court should deny them.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nIn general, “[t]o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of\nevidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what\nthe proponent claims it is.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(a). The Second Circuit has made clear that “the bar\nfor authentication of evidence is not particularly high.” United States v. El Gammal, 83l F. App’x\n539, 542 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Gagliardi, 5o6 F.3d l4o, l5l\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). Rule 9ol is “satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable\njuror could find in favor of authenticity or <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>,” E/ Gammal, 83l F. App’x at 542\n(quoting United States v. Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4)), and such “proof of\nauthentication may be direct or circumstantial,” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d l39, l72\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (citations and internal quotation marks omited).\n\nFor instance, in United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\norder), the defendant challenged the authenticity of “handwriten leters that were found in a USB\ndrive that was handed to an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” J/d. at\n24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge. “Although the Government did not present\n\n7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo678o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\nDetective Recarey—is dead. (/d. at 4-5). The defense is mistaken. The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that the photographs in Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\nirrelevant.

These photographs, [ine\n| | were displayed in Epstein’s home. ee\neee\neee\neee\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both Detective Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial.

(O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, i.e. before a sexual offence. Nevertheless, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. Nevertheless, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 45\nAlaggia et al. 279\nTable 2.

At the November l, 2o2l conference, the Court requested additional briefing\nregarding this evidence. The defense has moved to preclude this evidence, arguing that it cannot\nbe authenticated. (Dkt. No. 39o). For the reasons set forth belou, the defense is incorrect.\nTestimony at trial will establish that Government Exhibit 52 is in fact a contact book that belonged\nto the defendant, and the fact that the defendant kept contact information for Fs\nee: compelling evidence of her guilt. This evidence should be admited.\n\nI. Background\n\nGovernment Exhibit 52 is a printed, bound contact book, containing dozens of pages of\ncontacts, including family and friends of the defendant. The entire book is marked for\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> as Government Exhibit 52, and the Government anticipates asking a witness at trial\nabout the book—specifically, an individual who worked for Jeffrey Epstein (“Employee-l’’).\nHouever, the Government does not intend to offer the full contact book in evidence. Instead, the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6963", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006966.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document457_ Filed ll/l3/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo7)). To meet this burden, the Government need only introduce “sufficient proof. . .\nso that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>.” United States v.\nTin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d 3l, 38 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (internal quotation marks omited). For “a document\natributed to the defendant, the prosecution need only provide a rational basis from which the jury\ncould infer that the document did, in fact, belong to [her].” United States v. Osarenkhoe, 439 F.\nApp’x 66, 69 (2d Cir. 2oll) (summary order) (internal quotation marks and citation omited).\n\nEvidence of authenticity “may be direct or circumstantial, and the later category may\ninclude distinctive characteristics of the document itself.” United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,\n922 F.2d 934, 957 (2d Cir. l99o); Tin Yat Chin, 37l F.3d at 37. Indeed, Rule 9ol contemplates\nmultiple avenues through which a proponent may authenticate evidence. For example, the\nproponent may offer “[t]estimony that an item is what it is claimed to be,” or may offer evidence\nof “[t]he appearance, contents, substance, internal paterns, or other distinctive characteristics of\nthe item, taken together with all the circumstances.” Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(l) and (4).\n\nHere, the testimony of Employee-l establishes the authenticity of Government Exhibit 52.\nIn particular, the fact that Employee-l recognizes this exhibit and can identify it as the defendant’s\ncontact book based on its “distinctive characteristics” is all that Rule 9ol requires. Indeed, the\nSecond Circuit has affirmed the admission of evidence under similar circumstances, where, as\nhere, the Government does not offer evidence at trial about hou the exhibit came into the\nGovernment’s possession. In United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order), the defendant argued that the Government had failed to establish the authenticity\nof “handwriten leters that were found in a USB drive that was handed to an agent of the Federal\nBureau of Investigation in Afghanistan.” Jd. at 24. The Second Circuit rejected the challenge.\n“Although the Government did not present evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6966", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2o of l27 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34, (5th Cir. l985).\n\nl5 These two examples of focused cross-examination to\n\nl6 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and\nl7 thereby throu the product of the government's investigation\n\nl8 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the\n\nl9 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o.

Here, the defense seeks to suppress\n\n5 alleged Victim-4's <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of Ms. Maxwell on the ground\n6 that the government used unduly suggestive photo array\n\n7 procedures that violate due process rights.\n\n8 I am prepared to deny this motion. Eyewitness\n\n9 identifications should be excluded when improper police conduct\nlo created a substantial likelihood of misidentification. Perry\nll v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, (2ol2).\n\nl2 I follou a two-step analysis in ruling on the\n\nl3 admissibility of <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> evidence. First, I must\n\nl4 determine whether the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedures were\nl5 unduly suggestive. Some examples of suggestive procedures\n\nl6 include using a very small number of photographs, making\n\nl7 suggestive comments, or the display of the accused in a way\n\nl8 that so stood out from all other photographs to suggest to an\nl9 identifying eyewitness that the person was more likely to be\n2o the culprit. See, United States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369,\n2l (2d Cir. l992).\n22 Looking at the photo array, neither the photos used or\n23 the procedure itself was unduly suggestive. The array\n24 contained a sufficient number of photos larger than many arrays\n25 that courts have held were not unduly suggestive. Defense's\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7l5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page lol of l27 lol\nLBlTMAX3\n\nl argument that the Ms. Maxwell's photo looks like a mugshot and\n2 is different from the others doesn't persuade me here. Alleged\n3 Victim-4 identified at least one other photo in the array that\n4 she thought could be Ms. Maxwell but she ultimately chose\n\n5 Ms. Maxwell's photo, and there were several photos in the array\n6 that were of roughly the same quality and angle as\n\n7 Ms. Maxwell's photo.\n\n8 The defense fails to identify any suggestive comments\n9 made during the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that would deem the procedures\nlo unduly suggestive. The government appears to have asked\n\nll whether the individual recognized anyone in the book. So I\n\nl2 conclude the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> procedure was not unduly\n\nl3 suggestive.\n\nl4 Even assuming the photo array was unduly suggestive,\nl5 the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> here had independent reliability factors I\nl6 must consider under the totality of circumstances that include\nl7 the opportunity of the witness to view the individual at the\n\nl8 time of the alleged crime, the witness's degree of atention,\nl9 the accuracy of the the witness's prior description of the\n2o individual, the level of uncertainty demonstrated, the length\n2l of time between the alleged crime and the confrontation. See,\n22 Neil v. Biggers, 4o9 U.S. l88, (l972).\n23 Here, the alleged Victim-4 had the opportunity to view\n24 Ms. Maxwell. They interacted several times over the span of\n25 years.

But the harms to the business would be directly and proximately\ncaused by actions taken in furtherance of the scheme, qualifying the business as a victim. So too\nhere.\n\nIt is no answer to say, as the defense has argued, that Epstein’s conduct with respect to\nMinor Victim-3 was legal. For the purposes of seting forth the elements of the charged crime, the\nCourt must of course draw a clear line at the age of consent.” But the definition in the CVRA and\nVWPA “‘is certainly broad,” Batista, 575 F.3d at 23l, and is broader than the elements of the\noffense. Thus, in assessing whether Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under these definitions—and in\nassessing the admissibility of her testimony—such a clear line is neither required nor proper.\nEpstein and the defendant were not checking victims’ identifications at the door to ensure they\nwere above the age of consent in whichever location they were at the time. Just as Epstein’s\nprurient interest in girls did not switch off at midnight of their l7\" birthday, neither did it toggle\non and off as his plane crossed into jurisdictions with different ages of consent. Rather, Epstein\nand the defendant were engaged in a wide-ranging conspiracy to recruit girls for sexual abuse in\nmultiple jurisdictions with differing ages of consent. The core of the conspiracy was the agreement\nto engage in the criminal conduct, and it does not mater whether the elements of the substantive\ncrimes of transportation or enticement were completed or atempted to be completed as to Minor\nVictim-3. See Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (l997).

Ex. l, p lo.\n\nIf, houever, Dr. Rocchio testifies that she does not merely assume alleged victims are\ntelling the truth (as when, for example, Dr. Rocchio is acting in a forensic rather than clinical\ncapacity, see Ex. 2, p 39-4o), and that her expert opinions are based on a rigorous inquiry into the\nveracity the claims, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are still reliable and admissible. He can testify, for\nexample, that because the literature does not support the hypothesis that emotional distress (e.g.,\ncrying) is predictive of truthfulness, Ex. l, p ll, Dr. Rocchio is wrong to base her opinions about\nher patients on such conduct.\n\nFor another thing, Dr. Dietz does not propose to tell the jury who is telling the truth and\nwho is not telling the truth. Thus, to use this Court’s words,\n\nDr. [Dietz’s] testimony is appropriate because []he does not testify as to any\n\nspecific witness’s credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 2o-CR-6o8 (DLC), 2o2l WL\n\nl9475o3, at *7; Johnson, 86o F.3d at ll4o (8th Cir. 2ol7) (explaining that an expert\n\nmay testify “regarding the general characteristics that sexually abused children\n\nexhibit” but may not usurp the jury’s role of assessing the credibility of any specific\n\nvictim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th lo86, lo97-98 (9th Cir. 2o2l) (same).\n(Dkt. 435, p 5).\n\nThe government is wrong to rely on United States v.

Mot. at\n22. Not only did Lumpkin concern eyewitness <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> (a concept far afield from the\ntestimony at issue here), but the expert witness there proposed to evaluate the credibility of\nwitnesses who made the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the defendant. Dr. Dietz does not propose to testify to\nthe credibility of accusers in this case.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7483", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 2l of 28\n\nThe issues in this case, by contrast, are far from simple: accusers making allegations\ndecades after the alleged events after reading, hearing, and speaking about the events with others,\nbarraged by media coverage, and motivated by monetary gain. Most of the accusers have spoken\npublicly and all have received large setlements from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund.\nTheir “memories” have changed dramatically over time and conveniently began to include Ms.\nMaxwell after retaining many of the same personal injury lawyers. None of the cases cited by the\ngovernment comes close to the issues presented here.\n\nDr. Elizabeth F. Loftus, Ph.D., is a distinguished professor and preeminent expert on\nmemory science, with extensive credentials and academic and research experience spanning\ndecades. She has published more than 2o books and over 6oo scientific articles and chapters, the\nmajority of which focus on the subject of memory.\n\nShe has been qualified as an expert and testified approximately 3oo times in civil and\ncriminal court cases and approximately loo times during depositions. Like Dr. Rocchio, she\nwould be testifying as a “blind” expert. Dr. Loftus will not testify about the credibility or lack\nthereof of any witness in this case nor will she testify about whether any particular memory of\nany witness is true or false or credible or mistaken. She will testify about hou human memory\noperates, the nature of the process of remembering as a reconstructive process, and the factors\nthat can cause memory distortion over time.\n\nAdmission of expert testimony on eyewitness <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and memory has significantly\nevolved, catalyzed by reversals due to DNA exoneration.° In 2ol3, the National Academy of\n\n> See, e.g., United States v.

In response, the National Research Council formed a commitee, co-\nchaired by the Honorable Jed Rakoff and Thomas Albright, a prominent cognitive scientist at the\nSalk Institute for Biological Studies.

The commitee recommended\nthat judges admit expert testimony as a way of educating juries on the science of memory. An\nalternative recommendation, having the court deliver a carefully crafted jury instructions that\ncould accomplish this same educational goal, requires the daunting task of devising the right\ninstructions.

Smith, 736 F.2d llo3,\nllo7 (6th Cir. l984) (“The day may have arrived, therefore, when Dr. Fulero’s testimony can be\nsaid to conform to a generally accepted explanatory theory.”)). As also noted by the court in\nSmithers, “[s|tate court decisions also reflect this trend.” (citing State v. Buell, 22 Ohio St.3d\nl24, 489 N.E.2d 795 (l986) (overruling per se rule and holding expert testimony admissible to\ninform jury about factors generally affecting memory process)). Moreover, the court noted that\n“several courts have held that it is an abuse of discretion to exclude such expert testimony.”\n(citing United States v. Stevens, 935 F.2d l38o, l4oo-ol (3d Cir. l99l) (reversing and\nremanding for new trial); Smith, 736 F.2d at llo7 (holding error harmless in light of other\ninculpatory evidence); Douning, 753 F.2d at l232 (holding error harmless in light of other\ninculpatory evidence); State v.

The helpfulness of this type of testimony is well recognized. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v.

A at l3-l4). This is plainly inadequate under the rules,\nand the Government cannot litigate the qualifications, reliability, or relevance of unknoun\ntestimony about unidentified documents at this time.\n\nOf course, the Court has the option of permiting the defense to clarify this notice mid-trial\nwhenever the defense receives and reviews the documents they have in mind. Doing so, houever,\nwould almost certainly lead to mid-trial Daubert briefing, possibly a mid-trial Daubert hearing,\nand late-breaking rebutal expert notice by the Government.\n\nThe beter course is to require the defense to identify, immediately, the documents they\nexpect to be the subject of forensic analysis and the precise forensic methodology that these experts\nwill use to analyze those documents. That may—depending on the details—permit some Daubert\nlitigation to occur nou, because the Government may be able to agree with, or challenge, the notion\nthat these experts are qualified to use the methodology, that the methodology is reliable, or that\nthe document is relevant.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Defense on December l2, 2o2l, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to\ntestify under a pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a leter opposing this\nrequest on December l4, 2o2l. The Defense’s primary contention is that some form of\nanonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permited three alleged\nvictims and two related government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms. The Court disagrees\nwith this basic premise and denies the Defense’s motion.\n\n“By convention, most witness examinations begin with an introduction of the witness to\nthe fact finder, including the witness’s name, education, residence, work history, family etc.\nSuch background gives the fact finder some insight into who the witness is while also serving to\nsteady the witness’s nerves.” 3o Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, Evidence\n§ 64o8 (2d ed. 2o2l); see Alford v. United States, 282 U.S. 687, 69l-92 (l93l). That\npresumption of <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> is based, in part, on the “firmly established” principle that “the\npress and general public have a constitutional right of access to criminal trials . . . embodied in\nthe First Amendment.” Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596,\n6o3 (l982). “There are rare instances, houever, when it may be appropriate... to preclude...\ninquiring into the witness’s identity and background.” Wright & Miller, supra, § 64o8.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 8 of 24 2o\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was\n\n2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (loth Cir. l986). The court\n3 stated that, if disclosed, \"the defense could have\n\n4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the\n\n5 photographs\" that they did as well about their failure to\n\n6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.\n\n7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in\n\n8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police\n\n9 report was material under Brady because it shoued key witnesses\nlo to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination\nll would have meant the destruction of the witness's\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and the discrediting in some degree of the\n\nl3 police methods employed in assembling the case against the\n\nl4 defendant. Lindsey v.

In its brief, the defense seeks to\n2o affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- \"call FBI\n2l case agents as witnesses\" to ask who they talked to, what\n22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response\n23 at 4o. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the\n24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques\n25 does not tend to shou the defendant's innocence of the charges.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 594 _ Filed o2/o4/22 Page3of5\nPage 3\n\nThere is no need to litigate the Defense Motion under seal just because the Court and the\nparties are contemplating a hearing where Juror 5o may be a witness. Throughout the course of\nthis case (as in most if not every case), the parties have publicly litigated evidentiary issues\nimplicating witness testimony, such that witnesses or their counsel could access the briefing if they\nso wished. In this case, the parties publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial\nmotions and motions in /imine, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in\nmotions in limine, the parties litigated the legal contours of the testimony of the witness who\ntestified under the pseudonym Kate, as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of the\ndefendant. See, e.g., Dkt. Nos. 387, 392, 397. Neither the Government nor the defendant sought\nto file such documents under seal; the defendant certainly did not claim that such documents should\nbe temporarily sealed because Government witnesses could access such filings (or news articles\nabout such filings) and accordingly tailor their trial testimony. There is no reason that the Defense\nMotion should be treated differently and litigated entirely under seal.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the public docketing of the Defense Motion will enable\nJuror 5o to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice\nin this (like every) case, but it is also unsupported by any legal authority. (Def. Leter at 2). The\ndefendant’s reliance on cases involving pre-trial publicity is inapposite. Those cases concern the\nright to a fair ‘rial, and, in those cases, sealing is proper upon specific findings that, inter alia,\n“there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by\npublicity ....” United States v.

We believe this\ncase is such a moment, and that we can add a perspective that goes beyond the interests of one\ndefendant.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach folloued by this Court in this\nhigh-profile case of using a juror questionnaire and follouing up with voir dire can be highly\neffective. See Skilling v. United States, 56l U.S. 358, 384 (2olo) (“Although the widespread\ncommunity impact necessitated careful <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and inspection of prospective jurors’\nconnections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follou up voir dire were well\nsuited to that task.”) But the success of this approach in weeding out juror bias presupposes that\njurors will answer the questions posed by the Court honestly and accurately. Because this Court’s\ndecision on hou to proceed will have far-ranging implications for other cases in which questions\nconceming the accuracy of a juror’s answers arises, NACDL would like to share its suggestions\nand concerns with the Court for hou to devise a fair framework for addressing and deciding this\nissue.\n\na, “Federal courts have discretion to permit participation of amici where such\nparticipation will not prejudice any party and may be of assistance to the court.” Strougo v.\nScudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc., l997 WL 473566 (S.D.N.Y.

Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011175.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2of6\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>.” Jd.

But in any event\nthe Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,\nit is responsive to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso\nsuggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login\ndata, which shous that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”\nundermines that claim. The defendant can hardly claim that the Government provided insufficient\nnotice of testimony it discussed with the witness in response to the defendant’s expert notice and\nwhich the Government would only elicit in response to cross-examination on the subject.\n\nThere is no further opinion contained in the December 5 notes. In response to a question\nfrom defense counsel, the Government asked Flatley hou he determined the number of user\naccounts and logins, and Flatley rechecked those numbers.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Counsel:\n\nThe Government expects to offer testimony from Computer Forensic Examiner Stephen\nFlatley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (“FBI”) Computer Analysis Response Team\n(“CART”). As noted in the Government’s September l5, 2o2l leter, although the Government\nbelieves that Examiner Flatley’s testimony will not require admission through Rule 7o2 of the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, the Government provided expert notice. In an abundance of caution,\nthe Government is providing additional description of Examiner Flatley’s anticipated testimony.\n\nThe Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the forensic\nexamination of the devices marked for <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> as Government Exhibits 54 and 55, and his\ndetermination that those exhibits are clones. He is expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy\nof one piece of media to another. Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact\ncopy, of the exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the\nimages of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices because he ran\na hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on the original devices and the\nimages, which are identical.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol-l Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of4\nPage 2\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that Government\nExhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for Government Exhibits 55 and 54,\nrespectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that such registry software information includes\nseveral fields, including registered organization and registered ouner, which are user input data.\nHe is expected to explain that Government Exhibits 4o5 and 4l9 were generated by Access Data\nAD Lab.\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that he examined\ncertain exhibits contained on the devices marked for <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> as Government Exhibits 54 and\n55. In particular, he is expected to testify that Government Exhibits 4l2, 4l5, and 424 are emails\non Government Exhibit 54; Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are Word documents on\nGovernment Exhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 4l8B, 42oB, 42lB, and 422B contain the\nproperties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify\nthat Government Exhibits 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 were created under a user profile named “gmax.”\nHe is also expected to testify that Government Exhibit 4l7 is a Word document stored on\nGovernment Exhibit 55. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify that that the metadata fields listed\non Government Exhibits 4l7, 4l8, 42o, 42l, and 422 are true and accurate reflections of the\nmetadata properties for those files, such as the fields listing the author, content created date, date\nlast saved, last saved by, and last printed. Examiner Flatley will explain that he confirmed the\naccuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner\nFlatley will explain that metadata is information about a file, such as the file name and when the\nfile was created. He will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or\nembedded inside certain files, like Word documents.\n\nThe Government also notes that Examiner Flatley discussed similar topics in testimony\nreferenced in the September l5, 2o2l leter. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr.\n643 (PKC) (describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. Dilomasso, l4 Cr. l6o\n(SAS) (describing hash values). He has also testified about similar topics in United States v.\nHealey, ll Cr. l32 (SAS).\n\nAs noted, the Government does not believe that the foregoing testimony encompasses the\nsort of “opinion” that requires expert testimony. Rather, Examiner Flatley’s testimony is based on\nhis first-hand knouledge and observation during his examination of the devices in question. To\nthe extent he offers anything resembling an opinion, it is the product of reasoning processes\nfamiliar to the average person. While Examiner Flatley possesses specialized knouledge by virtue\nof his training and experience, his testimony reflects his investigatory findings and conclusions,\nand is not rooted exclusively in his expertise. To the extent Examiner Flatley’s testimony is\ncharacterized as expert “opinion” testimony under Rule 7o2, we note that his experience and\ntraining are described in his curriculum vitae, which was produced to you on September l5, 2o2l\nbearing Bates number 35o3-ool.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll92", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6ofl2\nshe did not engage in sexualized massages with Jane therefore in no way contradicts Jane’s\ntestimony.\n\nSimilarly, atempting to identify Michelle Healy as the “Michelle” Jane mentioned lacks a\nbasis in the record. Michelle Healy was far from the only Michelle in the defendant and Epstein’s\nworld. For instance, the list of masseuses in the exhibit marked for <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> as Government\nExhibit 4l7 includes three entries for various people named Michelle, none identified with the last\nname Healy. And although Jane has previously told the Government that Kelly Bovino was\ninvolved in group sexualized encounters with her, she did not so testify under oath, and that fact\nwas not put before the jury. Contrary testimony nou from Kelly Bovino would only confuse the\njury, and not contradict any of Jane’s testimony.”\n\nSecond, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane’s testimony, it does so only on\na collateral mater, namely, Jane’s adult sexual activity. The only time marker the defendant\nelicited in connection with any of Eva, Michelle, or Kelly is testimony that Jane knew Michelle\nwhile Jane was living in New York. (Tr. 533). As Jane testified on direct, she moved to New\nknouledge of sexualized massages involving Eva Dubin. See 35o9-oo8 at 7 (explaining that Jane\nwas “not sure if [the Eva on the flight records—that is, Eva Dubin] was part of the massages’’);\n35o9-o2o (explaining that Jane “does not remember DUBIN being involved in massages”).\n\n? Even if the defense had elicited the last names of the individuals Jane had in mind, their testimony\nstill would not contradict Jane’s. Defense counsel asked Jane whether she told the Government\nabout Eva, Michelle, and Kelly. Jane was not asked, and did not testify, that these individuals in\nfact participated in the group sexualized massages. If Dubin, Healy, and Bovino testify that they\ndid not, it in no way contradicts Jane’s testimony about what she did and did not tell the\nGovernment in a prior interview. Although defense counsel asked Jane whether Eva and Kelly—\nbut not Michelle—could confirm Jane’s “story,” those questions were continuations of counsel’s\nquestions regarding what Jane had told the Government in earlier interviews. (Tr. 526 (“You said\n[Eva] joined in with Sophie? . . . . She knew the routine? . . . So she could also confirm your\nstory?”); Tr. 527 (“And you told the government [Kelly] could back up what you were talking\nabout, right?”).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll258", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In this case, I had to inspect it to see what kind of\n7 data was on it, to see if it was already an image or if it was\n8 a clone so that if it was a clone, I would have to image it.\n\n9 If it was an image, I would just have to copy it.\n\nlo Q.

We take those -- that copy and\nl8 we write it into several different files and then that way it\nl9 containerizes the data inside it so we don't accidentally mess\n2o it up.\n2l Q. Did you image the drive that's been marked for\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that's been marked as Government Exhibit 54?\n23 A. Yes, I did.\n24 Q.

In this case, I had to inspect it to see what kind of\n7 data was on it, to see if it was already an image or if it was\n8 a clone so that if it was a clone, I would have to image it.\n\n9 If it was an image, I would just have to copy it.\n\nlo Q.

We take those -- that copy and\nl8 we write it into several different files and then that way it\nl9 containerizes the data inside it so we don't accidentally mess\n2o it up.\n2l Q. Did you image the drive that's been marked for\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that's been marked as Government Exhibit 54?\n23 A. Yes, I did.\n24 Q.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 3\nspeak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because\nthose victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in\nconnection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019518.jpg": "Odsedl ZADAaO S BOs ATTEN tide WAG 262 F iB 6228/PAg Kalgei4l Ab7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nJuly 28, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the\nprotective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who\nhave not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names\nfrom court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense\ncounsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so\nwould be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might\nwant to do so.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject\nmater limitation as to the phrase “public fora.” Adopting the defendant’s proposal would mean\nthat any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell\npublicly in any capacity would be subject to public <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> by the defendant and her counsel\nin connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke\nto a journalist for a local story in l997, or posted on a MySpace page folloued by a handful of\nfriends in 2oo5, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2oo9, or posted on Twiter to a handful\nof follouers in 2ol3. But none of these examples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly\nbe construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose “‘to self-identify,” Def. Ltr.\nat 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public atention\nand scrutiny.\n\nAdditionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without\nproviding any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no\nlimitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense\nstatements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s proposal seeks authorization to drag into the\npublic glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no\nmater hou long ago or hou brief—without that victim’s knouing consent and without any\nsubstantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make\nproductions of discovery and 35oo materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions\nwill necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call\nas witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But\nthe defendant’s proposal would allou her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public\nstatement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps\nor trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nConversely, the Government’s submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not\nbe precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this\ncriminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed\nchoice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order {/f 5, 6, 8. The\nidentity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and\nher counsel.\n\nThe defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical in all material\nrespects” to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB) (Dkt. 38).\nDef. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false.

Jd. 74. Here, defense\ncounsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims\nof either the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public fora, or in litigation”—a vastly broader\nallouance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would\nhave been subject to public naming and <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> under the Epstein protective order, but every\nsingle one would be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.\n\nAdditionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant\ndifferences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time\nthe Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified\nthemselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was\nextremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was\nentered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about\ntheir victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their oun terms and in their oun\nways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act in the context of\nthe dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein follouing his suicide. Those victims could\nnot possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by\ndefense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue\nto come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal,\nshaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel\nin this case.\n\nIn sum, the requested modification to the Government’s proposed order sought by the\ndefendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is\nwithout basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the\ndefendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to\npublicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other\nthan a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.? At botom, the\ndefendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no\ndiscernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and\nJeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, applicable law, and\ncommon decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense\nproposal would afford.\n\nB.

As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020430.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page44 of 9l\n8/l3/2o2l) (See ORDER set forth) (ap) (Entered: o8/l3/2o2l)\n\no8/l3/2o2l | 3l8 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March l9, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited a sealed and ex parte motion for an order authorizing four subpoenas\npursuant to Rule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

Count Six charged the Defendant with the substantive count of\nsex trafficking of an individual under the age of eighteen. The Government was required to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (l) the Defendant knouingly recruited, enticed, harbored,\ntransported, provided, or obtained a person; (2) the Defendant knew that the person was under\nthe age of eighteen; (3) the Defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lool", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021096.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page49 of ll3\nprovision as to Epstein.

The Justice\nManual supports this view, admonishing prosecutors who do not wish to bind\nUSAOs in other districts to “explicitly limit the scope” of the NPA to their\ndistricts. Justice Manual, Comment to § 9-27.63o (emphasis added). The absence\nof the phrase “in this District” from the co-conspirator immunity provision\ntherefore compels the inference that the parties did not intend to so limit its reach.\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to\nobtain a global resolution that would, among other things, provide maximum\nprotection for any alleged co-conspirators. Al75 (noting that Epstein “seeks to\nresolve globally his state and federal criminal liability”).

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty.

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021554.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 378 3536o39, Pagel24 of 2l7\n9\nM6SOmaxl\nl to be blind, deaf and dumb, and to say nothing of Epstein's and\n2 Ms. Maxwell's lives.\n3 Paragraph 26, there's an objection to the\n4 characterization concerning the defendant's <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and\n5 isolation of minor girls as inconsistent with the trial\n6 evidence. I overrule this objection for the same reasons as\n7 articulated with respect to paragraph 22. In addition, the\n8 trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein\ng isolated girls by spending time with them alone away from their\nlo families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to\nll New Mexico. Jane's testimony that she would spend time at the\nl2 Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and the defendant.\nLs Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two\nl4 objections: First, to the assertion that the defendant and\nl5 Epstein developed a scheme that created a \"constant stream of\nl6 girls who recruited each other.\" And, second, she objects to\nl7 the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other\nl8 minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualized massages.\nl9 Again, based on the trial testimony and evidence, I\n2o overrule the objection. It supported the information in these\nal paragraphs. The evidence indicated the scheme started with the\n22 defendant's recruitment of Virginia. Virginia then enlisted\n23 Carolyn in addition to at least two other girls. Carolyn in\n24 turn recruited at least three friends, and those friends then\n25 brought more girls.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l554", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021999.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 22 Filed ol/28/2o Page 2of3\nJanuary 28, 2o2o\nPage 2\nGovernment also produced 35oo material for every individual interviewed during the investigation\nin December, nearly four months in advance of trial.\n\n‘Whether or not to adjourn a trial date is traditionally within the discretion of the trial\njudge.” United States v. Scopo, 86l F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. l988) (internal quotations omited).\nWhile there “is no mechanical test with respect to requests for a continuance or adjournment,”\nUnited States v. Al Fawaz, ll6 F. Supp. 3d l94, 2lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5), the Second Circuit has\nidentified certain circumstances in which an adjournment may be appropriate: (l) the requested\ndelay is of a short (or at least fixed duration); (2) the sought-after evidence is specified with\nparticularity; (3) the proposed evidence is critical to the defense; and (4) the defendant has not\nbeen dilatory. /d. at 2ll (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d\n8l4, 8l4-l6 (2d Cir. l963)).\n\nNone of the circumstances identified in A/ Fawaz necessitate the lengthy adjournment\nrequested by the defendants. The Government’s case-in-chief turns on a brief, fourteen-hour\nwindou for which the evidence is limited and nou available to the defendants. Moreover, even as\nexpanded to include all of the additional material produced as described above, the discovery in\nthe instant case is neither unusually voluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no\nspecific reasons why the review of the materials requires a six-month adjournment.\n\nNor does the need to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such an\nadjournment. Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he intends to file a motion to dismiss the\nindictment, while Noel’s counsel states that he has not been able to determine what motions to file\npending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, houever, identifies no reason to believe such\na review is likely to result in the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of any potential pre-trial motions: as counsel is\naware, the Government did not obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the\ndefendants make post-arrest statements that the Government would seek to introduce into\nevidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to seek to suppress. As for the motion\nto dismiss, which does not depend on a review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifies no\nreason why such a motion could not be made in short order.\n\nFinally, with respect to the need to interview witnesses, as noted above, the Government\nhas already produced all of the witness statements in its possession, almost all of them on\nDecember 3l, 2ol9, nearly four months before trial. As the Court is well-aware, such productions\nof witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled to begin. As such,\nthe Government’s early production of those materials—giving the defendants months of additional\ntime to review those statements and take any potential investigation steps based upon them—\ncannot possibly merit a lengthy postponement of the trial date.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l999", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022175.jpg": "DATE AIRCRAFT MAKE <span class=\"highlight\">IDENTIFICATION</span> TO Mites FLT. 5.\nl9.44) MARK tae | foe.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023231.jpg": "OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report. The\nDepartment promulgated the guidelines in response to a congressional directive in a predecessor statute to the CVRA,\nwhich instructed the Atorney General to develop and implement such guidelines.

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023371.jpg": "Epstein was housed, from the common area of the SHU between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and\napproximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\nIn Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and a description of\nsignificant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the applicable laws, federal\nregulations, and BOP policies. In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth\nour findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath.

Atorney Processing\nMCC New York conducts a daily count of all inmates at 4:oo p.m.,\nwith an additional count at lo:oo a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and\nfederal holidays. Additional unscheduled counts may also occur\nin emergencies. During a count, inmates must be at their\nassigned ceil or bunk, unless the inmate has been authorized to\nbe in another area. In order to guarantee an accurate count, a\nreguest that an inmate remain in the visiting room during the\ncount must be made at least one Nour before the count, l.6.,\n3:oo pom. for the 4:oo p.m. count and 9:oo a.m. for the lo:oo\na.m. count. When this approval is granted, the inmate is placed\non the “out count” and will be required to remain in the\nvisiting room until the count has been completed. Inmates who\nhave not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal\nvisits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:3o p.m. and\n9:3o a.m. Atorneys who arrive at the institution within an\nhour before the start of a count, i-.e., after 3:oo p.m. or 9:oo\na.m., will not be able to visit their client until after the\ncount clears,\nCounts usually take approximately 3o-4o minutes to clear. During\nthis time, all movement in the institution ceases. Conseguently,\natorneys and/or their representatives will not be alloued to\nenter or exit the Visiting Room during official counts. Visits\nshould be scheduled accordingly to avoid unnecessary delays.\nBy <span class=\"highlight\">Identification</span>\nTo receive atorney entrance privileges, an individual must he\nable to establish his or her status as an atorney by presenting\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that verifies active membership in any state bar.\nExcluding Legal Aid Society Federal Defender’s, NY State\nAtorneys are required to have a Secure Pass <span class=\"highlight\">Identification</span> card\nfor entrance. Upon notification that a NY State atorney is not\nin possession of a Secure Pass, and upon approval from the Legal\nDepartment, atorneys will be permited to enter the institution\nfor 65o days from their date of approval without the Secure Pass.\nIf an atorney is licensed in a state other than New York,\nhe/she must contact the legal department at least 24 hours in\nadvance so that their status as an atorney in good standing may\nbe verified. Provided the Legal Department can verify the\natorney’s status, the atorney will be added on a list located\nin the lobby, authorizing the atorney’s entrance for a one year\nPage 4 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23747", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023748.jpg": "period with government issued picture <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, such as a\ndrivers license.

Visits will not be\napproved if alternative arrangements are avallable to defense\ncounsel.\n7. Dress Code\nAll visitors, including atorneys, are required to dress ina\nmanner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively\nprovocative, immodest or revealing atire is reason to deny\nvisiting. Visitors over the age of l2 will not be alioued into\nthe institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses\nexceeding three inches above the kneecap in length. See-through\nclothing, halter-tops, tube tops, tank tops, any top that\nreveals the midriff area, lou-cut shirts or blouses, revealing\nfront and/or backless clothing, skin-tight ciothing, spandex\nclothing and sweat pants are not alloued. Furthermore, clothing\nwhich may impede <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> (e.g., hoods) or easily hide\ncontraband (e.9g., coats) present security concerns and are also\nprohibited. All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shouer\nshoes, flip-fiops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind)\nand undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has\ndelegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision—\nmaking authority regarding what atire is appropriate inside the\nVisating Room.

Legal Representatives\nAtorneys are alloued to visit their clients upon providing\nevidence of their professional status. Houever, atorneys often\nneed other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters,\nmitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their\nclients in connection with legal representation. These\nindividuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to\natorneys and must first submit an application (See ATTACHMENT\nA) signed by a sponsoring atorney and pass a background check\nbefore being granted permission to enter MCC New York.\nPage 7 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2375o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023755.jpg": "3 Emergency Telephone Calls\nInmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to 4a death\nor serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a\nrequest to the Religious Services Department.

Legal Mail\nAll legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail\naddressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to\nsender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.\n\nl. Legal Mail Envelopes:\nThe Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may\nreceive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8; and\nBureau of Prisons Program Statement 58oo.lo, Mail Management\nManual (“PS 58oo.lo\"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides\nthat special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of\nthe inmate, will be treated as such “if the sender is adequately\nidentified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is\nmarked ‘Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the\ninmate.’\" 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8(a). Houever, the presence of a\nreturn address with a firm name does not suffacientiy adentify\nthe sender of the material as an atorney.\n\nSpecifically, the atorney must be adequately\n\nidentified on the envelope as an atorney . . . The\n\nuse of the titie \"Esquire\" without additional\n\nindication of the sender's occupation does not\n\nestablish the bearer as an atorney or legal aid\n\nsupervisor. Mail from individuals using the title\n\n\"Esquire\" as the exclusive <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of their\n\nstatus shall not be handled as special mail, even if\n\nthe envelope contains some special mail markings.\nP.S. 58oo.l6, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handing of\nlegal mail, strict compliance with these procedures wil be\nenforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify\nlegai mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm's\nname) and their legal status (i.e., atorney), in the return\naddress portion of the envelope. This information, in addition\nto writing elsewhere on the envelope “Special Mail —- Open oniy\nin presence of inmate,” will ensure that legal mail is treated\nas confidential atorney-client communication.\n\nPage l2 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023773.jpg": "STATEMENT OF APPLICANT\nI certify that | am authorized to act as the legal representative of :\nwho is a Jicensed member of the bar of the State of. ;\nI request that I be alloued to interview and correspond with ,\nFederal Register Number. , who is contined at the MDC/ MCC,\nIam aware of my responsibility as a representative of the above-named atorney and certify\nthat I am able to meet this responsibility.

The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our\ninstitution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.\nR&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified\nimmediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an\ninmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and\nWarden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the\ngeneral population.\nInmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a\nmember of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general\npopulation.

If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY\nALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be\nnotified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to\nscreen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other\npertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.\nInmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.\nPsychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,\nbut will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex\noffense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.\nThe atached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and\nimplemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follou-up procedures when existing PSY\nALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an\nexisting PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the\ninstitution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology\nDepartment will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology\nDepartment will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These\nreports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is\nscheduled to go out to court the follouing day.\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or\nconcerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their\nreturn to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to\ngeneral population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there\nis no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk\nassessment by a psychologist.

During the initial intake screening by medical\nstaff, inmates complete a psychological questionnaire. Psychology Services staff are immediately\nnotified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place\nan inmate on suicide watch.\nThe Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program\nCoordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance\nwith suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, referral,\nassessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly\nrestrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for\nhousing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's\nHealth Services division, which allou staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without\ncompromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to\nthe room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects,\nmaterials, or architectural features that would allou for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are\nevaluated daily by apsychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions.\nOnce an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist\nfollouing a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.\nWith regard to staffing levels, l5,ol2 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and l,654\ncorrectional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2ol9. The BOP continues to work on hiring and\nretaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General. The\nBOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess\nany additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.\nThe factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors\ninclude an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a\nplan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.\nPublic Information Office\nFederal Bureau of Prisons\n(2o2) 35>\"\n>fpermme o/22/2ol9 ll:39 AM >>>\noO Page l3885\nDOJ-OGR-ooo26o47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026051.jpg": "Page 2362\n\nnotified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses.

Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses\nRelied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits.\n\nVirtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable\ncause affidavit has a background that casts significant doubt on whether the\nwitness is sufficiently credible to support a finding of probable cause, let alone to\nsustain what would be the State’s burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the\nwitnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which\nundercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence\nwas submited to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the\nprobable cause affidavit, or released to the public. Belou we address solely the\nomited criminal histories. Follouing that, we list other factors that make each\nwitness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at\ntrial — all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omited from the\nPolice Report, the probable cause affidavit and the public disclosure.\n\n6.

As the PBPD well knew, in 2oo3, Alessi was filmed taking\nmoney from Epstein’s home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully\nentering Epstein’s home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admited to\nthe PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,\nstealing cash and atempting to steal Epstein’s licensed handgun (which in fact\nwent missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report\ndetailing Alessi’s confession. Also knoun to the PBPD, but omited from the\nPolice Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to\nkill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination\nof credibility, and was specifically knoun to Det.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023261.tif": "pits U.S. Department of Justice\nMoree , Federal Gurzau of Investigation\nffs FBI - West Palm Beach\nat ie .

Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta recognized that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have recognized the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023371.tif": "Epstein was housed, from the common area of the SHU between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and\napproximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo.\nFinally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were\nmore consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The\nMedical Examiner also cited to the absence of debris under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands,\ncontusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that evidenced Epstein had been in a struggle, which\nwould be expected if Epstein’s death had been a homicide by strangulation.\nAs discussed in greater detail in the Conclusions and Recommendations chapter of this report, this is not\nthe first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on the part of\nBOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that inmates are safe,\nsecure, and in good health. The OIG has investigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of\nofficial BOP documentation concerning inmate counts and rounds and has repeatedly found deficiencies\nwith the BOP’s staffing levels, the custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, and security camera\nsystems at BOP institutions. The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance\nfailures documented in this report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most\nnotorious inmates in BOP’s custody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s\nfailures are troubling not only because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody,\nbut also because they led to questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively\ndeprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process.\nThe fact that these failures have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional\nurgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DO] personnel have commited misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this\nsame standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee\nbased on such misconduct. See 5 U.S.C. 8 77ol(c)(l)(B) and 5 C.F.R. 8 l2ol.56(b)(l)(i).\nIn Chapter 2 of this report, we provide background information, including <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> and a description of\nsignificant entities and individuals; a summary of our methodology; and the applicable laws, federal\nregulations, and BOP policies. In Chapter 3, we outline a timeline of key events. In Chapter 4, we set forth\nour findings of fact relating to the BOP’s custody and care of Epstein before his death. In Chapter 5, we set\nforth our findings of fact related to the events of August 8-lo, 2ol9, including Epstein’s death. In Chapter 6,\nwe set forth our findings of fact related to the BOP’s failure to ensure that there was a functional security\ncamera system at MCC New York, which resulted in limited recorded video evidence relevant to Epstein’s\ndeath. Finally, Chapter 7 contains our conclusions and recommendations.\n\n4\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023743.tif": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nl.

In the event an atorney requires an\nemergency visit outside normal legal visiting hours and has not\npre-requested it, he/she must contact the Operations Lieutenant.\nIf there is any problem with a legal visit during off duty hours,\natorneys should ask to speak with the Institution Duty Officer\nor Operations Lieutenant.\n2. Atorney Processing\nMCC New York conducts a daily count of all inmates at 4:oo p.m.,\nwith an additional count at lo:oo a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and\nfederal holidays. Additional unscheduled counts may also occur\nin emergencies. During a count, inmates must be at their\nassigned ceil or bunk, unless the inmate has heen authorized to\nbe in another area. In order to guarantee an accurate count, a\nreguest that an inmate remain in the visiting room during the\ncount must be made at least one hour before the count, l.6.,\n3:oo poem. for the 4:oo p.m. count and 9:oo a.m. for the lo:oo\na.m. count. When this approval is granted, the inmate is placed\non the “out count” and will be required to remain in the\nvisiting room until the count has been completed. Inmates who\nhave not been placed on the out count must terminate their legal\nvisits a half hour before the count begins, i.e., 3:3o p.m. and\n9:3o a.m. Atorneys who arrive at the institution within an\nhour before the start of a count, i-.e., after 3:oo p.m. or 9:oo\na.m., will not be able to visit their client until after the\ncount clears,\nCounts usually take approximately 3o-4o minutes to clear. During\nthis time, all movement in the institution ceases. Conseguently,\natorneys and/or their representatives will not be alloued to\nenter or exit the Visiting Room during official counts. Visits\nshould be scheduled accordingly to avoid unnecessary delays.\n3. <span class=\"highlight\">Identification</span>\nTo receive atorney entrance privileges, an individual must he\nable to establish his or her status as an atorney by presenting\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> that verifies active membership in any state bar.\nExcluding Legal Aid Society Federal Defender’s, NY State\nAtorneys are required to have a Secure Pass <span class=\"highlight\">Identification</span> card\nfor entrance. Upon notification that a NY State atorney is not\nin possession of a Secure Pass, and upon approval from the Legal\nDepartment, atorneys will be permited to enter the institution\nfor 6o days from their date of approval without the Secure Pass.\nIf an atorney is licensed in a state other than New York,\nhe/she must contact the legal department at least 24 hours in\nadvance so that their status as an atorney in good standing may\nbe verified. Provided the Legal Department can verify the\natorney’s status, the atorney will be added on a list located\nin the lobby, authorizing the atorney’s entrance for a one year\nPage 4 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23747", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023748.tif": "period with government issued picture <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, such as a\ndrivers license.

All legal materials and briefcases will\nbe searched for contraband and processed through the flucoroscope.\nHandbags, newspapers, portable telephones, and non-legal\nmaterials are not permited in the Visiting Room.\nOfficial Visitors: Federal employees, including Assistant U.S.\nAtorneys, law enforcement officers, U.S. Court officials, U.S.\nProbation Officers, and Assistant Federal Public Defenders, will\nbe permited to visit upon presentation of appropriate\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>. All visitors must present official\n<span class=\"highlight\">identification</span>, sign in and out of the logbook, and pass through\nthe metal detector.\n4, Property Brought into the Visiting Room\nLegal Material\nAn atorney may bring into the visiting room legal materials\nrelated to an inmate’s case, including CDs, or audio/videotapes\nas well as deliar bills for the vending machines. An atorney\n{not a paralegal, investigator, mitigation specialist or\ninterpreter) will be authorized to provide a reasonable (not\nto exceed four inches) amount of legal materials to the inmate at\nthe conclusion of the atorney visit. The inmate will be alloued\nto take these legal materials with him/her to his/her unit after\nthe Officer determines the items are of a legal nature and he/she\ninspects them for contraband. Legal materials should not be read\nfor content but examined only to determine that they are indeed\nlegal materials and they are free of contraband. Inmates housed\nin the Special Housing Unit (SHU) will be alloued to take legal\nmaterials to their unit minus folders, paperclips, staples,\nrubber bands, or any other items that could be\nconsidered a security concern. All other materials, including\ncelliuiar phones, pagers, newspapers, magazines, tissues, wallets\nand keys, are prohibited and must be secured in a lobby locker\nbefore entering the secure confines of the institution.\nAdditionally, legal videos, CDs and audio tapes, cannot be\nprovided to an inmate during a legal visit but may be placed in\nthe Lobby legal mail drop box for delivery to the inmate.

Writen\nrequests for such approval should clearly outline the specific\nclrcumstances requiring this type of visit. Visits will not be\napproved if alternative arrangements are avallable to defense\ncounsel.\n7. Dress Code\nAll visitors, including atorneys, are required to dress ina\nmanner appropriate for a correctional environment. Excessively\nprovocative, immodest or revealing atire is reason to deny\nvisiting. Visitors over the age of l2 will not be alioued into\nthe institution in short skirts, mini skirts, shorts or dresses\nexceeding three inches above the kneecap in length. See-through\nclothing, halter-tops, tube tops, tank tops, any top that\nreveals the midriff area, lou-cut shirts or blouses, revealing\nfront and/or backless clothing, skin-tight clothing, spandex\nclothing and sweat pants are not alloued. Furthermore, clothing\nwhich may impede <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> {e.g., hoods) or easily hide\ncontraband (e.9., coats) present security concerns and are also\nprohibited. All visitors are required to wear shoes (no shouer\nshoes, flip-fiops, toe-revealing or backless shoes of any kind)\nand undergarments (including bras for females). The Warden has\ndelegated to the Institution Duty Officer the ultimate decision—\nmaking authority regarding what atire is appropriate inside the\nVisating Room. If the Buty Officer is not available, the\nOperations Lieutenant will make the final decision. A\nmemorandum containing clothing guidelines is posted in the lobby\nof MCC New York. It is the responsibility of visitors to\nfamiliarize themselves with this memo and watch for updates.\n8. Legal Representatives\nAtorneys are alloued to visit their clients upon providing\nevidence of their professional status. Houever, atorneys often\nneed other individuals, e.g., paralegals, interpreters,\nmitigation specialists, private investigators, to visit their\nclients in connection with legal representation. These\nindividuals do not receive the same entry privileges granted to\natorneys and must first submit an application (See ATTACHMENT\nA) signed by a sponsoring atorney and pass a background check\nbefore being granted permission to enter MCC New York.\nPage 7 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2375o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023755.tif": "3.

Likewise, if an\nindividual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons, they\nshould call the main number and ask to speak to the Religious\nServices Department.\nC. Legal Mail\nAll legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail\naddressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to\nsender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.\n\nl. Legal Mail Envelopes:\nThe Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may\nreceive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8; and\nBureau of Prisons Program Statement 58oo.lo, Mail Management\nManual (“PS 58oo.lo\"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides\nthat special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of\nthe inmate, will be treated as such “if the sender is adequately\nidentified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is\nmarked ‘Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the\ninmate.’” 28 C.F.R. § 54o.l8(a). Houever, the presence of a\nreturn address with a firm name does not suffacientiy adentify\nthe sender of the material as an atorney.\n\nSpecifically, the atorney must be adequately\n\nidentified on the envelope as an atorney . . . The\n\nuse of the title \"Esquire\" without additional\n\nindication of the sender's occupation does not\n\nestablish the bearer as an atorney or legal aid\n\nsupervisor. Mail from individuals using the title\n\n\"Esquire\" as the exclusive <span class=\"highlight\">identification</span> of their\n\nstatus shall not be handled as special mail, even if\n\nthe envelope contains some special mail markings.\nP.S. 58oo.l6, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handing of\nlegal mail, strict compliance with these procedures wil be\nenforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify\nlegai mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm's\nname) and their legal status (i.e., atorney), in the return\naddress portion of the envelope. This information, in addition\nto writing elsewhere on the envelope “Special Mail — Open oniy\nin presence cf inmate,” will ensure that legal mail is treated\nas confidential atorney-client communication.\n\nPage l2 of 22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023773.tif": "STATEMENT OF APPLICANT\nI certify that I am authorized to act as the legal representative of :\nwho is a Jicensed member of the bar of the State of. ;\nI request that I be alloued to interview and correspond with ,\nFederal Register Number , who is contined at the MDC/ MCC,\nIam aware of my responsibility as a representative of the above-named atorney and certify\nthat I am able to meet this responsibility.

Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses\nRelied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits.\n\nVirtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable\ncause affidavit has a background that casts significant doubt on whether the\nwitness is sufficiently credible to support a finding of probable cause, let alone to\nsustain what would be the State’s burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the\nwitnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which\nundercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence\nwas submited to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the\nprobable cause affidavit, or released to the public. Belou we address solely the\nomited criminal histories. Follouing that, we list other factors that make each\nwitness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at\ntrial — all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omited from the\nPolice Report, the probable cause affidavit and the public disclosure.\n\n6. Juan Alessi: While the Police Report (at page 57) and the probable cause\naffidavit (at page 2l) contain assertions by Alessi which allegedly support the\nbringing of criminal charges, omited is the evidence revealing Alessi’s\nevident mental instability; prior criminal conduct against Epstein; and bias\ntouards Epstein. As the PBPD well knew, in 2oo3, Alessi was filmed taking\nmoney from Epstein’s home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully\nentering Epstein’s home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admited to\nthe PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,\nstealing cash and atempting to steal Epstein’s licensed handgun (which in fact\nwent missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report\ndetailing Alessi’s confession. Also knoun to the PBPD, but omited from the\nPolice Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to\nkill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination\nof credibility, and was specifically knoun to Det. Recarey at the time the\nPolice Report and probable cause affidavits were writen, it was omited.\n\n7. Po While the Police Report and probable cause affidavit rely\non statements of MM the father of omited is\nevidence, knoun to the PBPD, that casts doubt on credibility and\nsustainability as a witness. Omited from the Police Report and probable\ncause affidavit is Federal fraud conviction, which defense\ninvestigators discovered and turned over to the PBPD during the course of the\ninvestigation. a cved 2l months in federal prison for his offense.\n\n8. perce, MLC Report and probable cause affidavit rely on\nstatements of the step-mother of Po omited is\nevidence, knoun to the PBPD that casts doubt on her credibility.
