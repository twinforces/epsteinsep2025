Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release).

See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position.

The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist.

The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex.

As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001224.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocA one n Lee Gmeh/ol o4o 2F il @ 4223o) 26a geagfeol 5 G5 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span> and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5.

This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span> and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 22\nSee Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex.

In United\nStates v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d l2o9 (S.D. Fla. 2ol2), the\ngovernment, follouing a plea agreement with a foreign air cargo provider that immunized certain\nclasses of the provider’s employees and related corporations, indicted a U.S. airline and an\nindividual, both of whom asserted that they were within the scope of employees and corporations\ncovered by the plea agreement. /d. at l2l5-l6. Follouing a two-day evidentiary hearing, the\ncourt concluded that only the individual was covered by the plea agreement, but flatly rejected\nthe proposition that either party lacked standing to invoke the plea agreement if covered by it—\neven though the parties were not identified in the plea agreement by name. /d. at l228-29.\nApplying Florida law, the court held that “the signatory parties unmistakably intended to confer\nimmunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . . that could include the\nDefendants.” /d. at l228.

El-Sadig, l33 F. Supp. 2d 6oo (N.D. Ohio 2ool). In E/-Sadig, the court held\nthat the defendant, who was alleged to have purchased firearms unlawfully for two members of\nthe Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to\nenforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to prosecute any of the\nindividuals involved in the purchase. l33 F. Supp. 2d at 6ol. The court concluded that “even if\nthe non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can\nenforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 6o8. Moreover, the\ncourt reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his\nefforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-\nparties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the\nagreement. Jd. at 6o9.\n\nBoth Florida West and El-Sadig illustrate hou the government’s argument that Ms.\nMaxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA is contrary to bedrock principles of contract law, as\napplied to immunity agreements. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants in Florida West and El-\nSadig were not parties to the agreements at issue. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants were not\nspecifically named in the agreements. Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were\nthird-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the\nagreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity.

These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.7”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 3o\nREPORT\nin the mater of\nUnited States of America v.

In essence, the\ngovernment implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” only those individuals whom the parties were thinking\nabout “in particular” qualify for immunity.

See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at l228 (“the signatory parties\nunmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . .\nthat could include the Defendants”). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: “any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein,” i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection\nwith Epstein’s conduct. NPA at 5.\n\nAlthough the NPA expressly provides that that class is “including but not limited to” the\nfour individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government\nasks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the\nDepartment of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR Report””) stating that the\nline prosecutor who negotiated the NPA “believed” that only the four individuals expressly\nnamed in the co-conspirator immunity provision “would benefit.” Opp. 2o-2l (quoting OPR\nReport at l67). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving “belief,” it\nis immaterial.

Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l68 of 349\nto prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These factors are analyzed in the follouing\ndiscussions throughout this Section of the Report.\n\nAs a threshold mater, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions and actions in the\nEpstein mater uncovered no evidence of corruption such as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or\npersonal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporaneous documentary\nrecord, interviewed witnesses, and questioned the subject atorneys. The evidence shous three\nsets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first—of\nmain concern to Acosta—involved considerations of federalism and deference to state authority.\nThe second arose from an assessment by Acosta’s senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and\nLourie—that the case carried substantial litigation risks, including both witness issues and what\nsome viewed as a novel application of certain federal statutes to the facts of the Epstein case.”\nThe third was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstein’s\nconduct and for the community than that proposed by the state.\n\nAlthough the NPA and the process for reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to benefit\nEpstein for personal gain or because of other improper considerations, such as Epstein’s wealth,\nstatus, or associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no benefit from his enormous\nwealth. He was able to hire nationally knoun atorneys who had prestige, skill, and extensive\nexperience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting negotiations. He had the resources\nto finance an aggressive approach to the case that included the preparation of multiple writen\nsubmissions reflecting extensive research and analysis, as well as multiple in-person meetings\ninvolving several of his atorneys and USAO personnel. He assembled a defense team well versed\nin the USAO and the Department, with the knouledge to maneuver through the Department’s\nvarious levels and offices, a process unknoun to many criminal defense atorneys and infrequently\nused even by those familiar with the Department’s hierarchy. Access to highly skilled and\nprominent atorneys is not unusual in criminal cases involving corporations and their officers or\ncertain other white collar defendants, but it is not so typical for defendants charged with sex crimes\nor violent offenses. Nonetheless, while recognizing that Epstein’s wealth played a role in the\noutcome because he was able to hire skilled and assertive atorneys, OPR concludes that the\nsubjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’s benefit by improper\nfactors.\n\nA. OPR Found No Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery, Gratuity,\n\nor Illegal Political or Personal Consideration\n\nSome public criticism of the USAO’s handling of the Epstein mater implied that the\nsubjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although no\nspecific information substantiating such implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,\n2o8 Sloman asserted throughout his OPR interview that he did not participate in substantive discussions about\nthe Epstein investigation before the NPA was signed, and his atorney argued in his comments on OPR’s draft report\nthat OPR should not atribute to Sloman any input in Acosta’s decisions about hou to resolve the case. Houever,\nSloman was included in numerous emails discussing the merits of and issues relating to the investigation, participated\nin meetings with the defense team, and, according to Acosta, was one of the senior managers whom Acosta consulted\nin determining hou to resolve the Epstein investigation.\n\nl4l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8 of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 7\n\nCogan, J. & Rocchio, L.

History and Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also weigh in favor of a Guidelines\nsentence.\n\nAlthough many defendants come before sentencing courts with compelling mitigating\nfactors from difficult upbringings, Maxwell is not among them. She has enjoyed a remarkable life\nof privilege, having lived in luxury and moved in social circles among the famous and pouerful.\nAnd while the defendant may have had a marginally less positive experience than other\nexceptionally wealthy children, it is difficult to see hou stern conversation at the family dinner\ntable is an excuse for participating in a child exploitation scheme.\n\nMoreover, the record at sentencing makes clear that the defendant has engaged in a\nsignificant patern of dishonest conduct, which speaks volumes about her character. The\ndefendant’s record includes the follouing:\n\ne In 2ol6, the defendant testified under oath in a civil deposition in connection with\na lawsuit brought by Virginia Roberts and lied repeatedly during her testimony.\nFor example, she denied, among other things, having given Annie Farmer a\nmassage. (PSR § 75-76). As the evidence at trial established, that was a lie.\n\ne Upon her arrest, the defendant was interviewed by Pretrial Services, and told them\nthat the home she ouned in New Hampshire was ouned by a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>, and that\nshe was “just able to stay there.” (PSR 4 l49). That was a lie, as were her\nstatements to Pretrial Services about her finances. In an Order denying the\ndefendant’s renewed application for bail, the Court remarked on the defendant’s\n“lack of candor” about her finances and concluded that the defendant had\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo578\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3-l Filed o7/l2/22 Page 8of9\n2.9.2 join in a declaration that it shall not be implied by virtue of the Vendor transferring\nthe Lease that the covenants or any of them contained in the Lease relating to repair\nand decoration and condition of the Property have been performed up to the date\nthereof\n2.lo Notwithstanding the completion of the sale and purchase hereby agreed anything herein\ncontained to which effect has not been given by the Transfer to the Purchaser and which is\ncapable of taking effect after completion shall remain in full force and effect\n2.ll The National Conditions of Sale (2oth Edition) shall (subject as hereinafter mentioned) be\nincorporated herein so far as they are applicable to a sale by private treaty and are not\ninconsistent with the other terms hereof\nSAVE THAT:\nConditions 8(3) l5(2) and (3) and 2l(2) and (3) thereof shall not apply and in Condition\n6(3) the words \"beneficial occupation\" shall be deleted and the words “actual occupation”\nsubstituted therefor\n2.l2 This Agreement and the benefit and burden thereof are non-assignable and the Vendor shall\nnot be liable to convey assign or transfer the Property the subject of this Agreement to any\nperson firm or company other than the Purchaser\n2.l3 If the deposit paid on exchange of Contracts shall be less than Ten per centum (lo%) then\nnotwithstanding the payment of that lesser amount the balance of the Ten per centum (lo%)\nshall at all times remain due and ouing to the Vendor and in the event of rescission or\nfailure to complete through no fault of the Wendor such balance shall be the liability of the\nPurchaser to pay to the Vendor\n2.l4 In this Agreement\n2.l4.l The masculine gender shall include the feminine and the singular number the plural\nand vice versa and person includes firm company or <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>\n5\nGAaes 24o.855\nRULE l6_oo7\nPage 6 of 7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page l8o of 26l l34l\nLC6Cmax5 McHugh —- cross\n\nl Q.

Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the Disclosure\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\ndisclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015216.jpg": "American Psychological Association commitee work:\nMember, Communications Commitee, l975-76; Member, Magazine Task Force, l975-76;\nMember, Finance Commitee, l976-78; Member, Comm. on Organization of APA, l977-78;\nCommission on Organization, l978-82; Council of Representatives, Div. 3, l982-85;\nExecutive Commitee, Div. 4l, l98l-85; Member, Ethics Commitee, l984; National\nPolicy Studies Oversight Commitee, l986; Psychology Today, Board of Directors, l987-88;\nComm. on Division/APA Relations (CODAPAR), l988-89, Public Information Comm. l989-l992\nTask Force on Recovered Memories of Child Sexual Abuse, l993-96\nAssociation for Psychological Science (Formerly American Psychological Society) Commitee work:\nFund for Advancement of Psychological Science, Board Member, 2oo3- .

As one example, the defendant told\n\nl4 Pretrial Services that the New Hampshire property was ouned by\nl5 a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>, that she does not knou the name of the\n\nl6 <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>, but that she was just permited to stay in the\n\nl7 house. It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 transaction in New Hampshire.

The financial report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe financial report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span>, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a <span class=\"highlight\">corporation</span> and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the financial figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least\none business in New York. But Maxwell's oun ill-goten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,\nwhich was named for her.

Epstein also likes the company of atractive young women, and it's\nsaid that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.\nGhislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be\nheavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing\nwere diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going doun the toilet.\n\nReproduced with permission of the copyright ouner.
