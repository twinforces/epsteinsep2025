Accordingly,\nOPR considered the evidence and information regard-\ning Epstein’s and his assistants’ conduct as it was\nknoun to the subjects at the time they performed their\nduties as Department atorneys.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001157.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8)26adedGecl 5 Ob 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing.

(See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score.

Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001321.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page4 of 25\n\nfront of a victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being\npresent for sex acts involving a minor victim and Epstein.

More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr.

The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

Ltr. at l, 3,\nshould be of litle comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to\nscrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal\nstandards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l5 of 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 24 of 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of 26\nbank records, records of payments to alleged accusers, facsimile transmissions, emails, and\nphone records.

Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2542", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2543", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2546", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 38\nthe NPA’s language and structure, as well as the manner in which it was negotiated, were highly\natypical.

The Structure of the NPA\n\nThe NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at l-2), a\nparagraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a\nlist of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various\nprovisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it\ncontains no defined terms other than “State Atorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly\nseparates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to\nthe USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the\nU.S. Atorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States\nAtorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the\nUnited States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”).

Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\na In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2636", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002637.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l4\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nlX\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2637", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of l4\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2639", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42-2 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l4\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo264o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002681.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of l6\nconduct that allegedly took place more than two decades ago—accusations so vague that they do\nnot even link Ms. Maxwell to the only specific allegation of travel by Accuser-l in the\nindictment (see Indictment JJ llb, l7b).\n\nTo try to bolster its case, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in\nEpstein’s alleged “sexual abuse” of two other individuals, Accuser-2 and Accuser-3, and has\nincluded allegations regarding Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with these two individuals in the\nindictment. But the allegations as to Accuser-3 cannot possibly support the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell: Although the gravamen of a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense is enticing or causing an\nindividual to travel, there is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled—let alone that Ms.\nMaxwell (or Epstein, for that mater) enticed her to do so or transported her. Moreover, although\nboth § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) require an intent that the traveling individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity, the indictment alleges no facts suggesting that Epstein’s alleged sexual activity\nwith Accuser-3, who was over the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times, was\nunlawful. As a result, these allegations serve only to demonstrate a propensity on the part of Ms.\nMaxwell that will prejudice the jury against her.\n\nTo enable the presentation of evidence regarding Accuser-3, the government claims the\nalleged “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 is somehou an “overt act” in furtherance of conspiracies to\ncause unspecified individuals to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.\nThe government’s inclusion of these allegations, houever, is nothing more than an atempted\nend-run around its obligations under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). The “overt act” alleged as to\nAccuser-3 has nothing to do with the alleged conspiracy. Moreover, the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 are unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the\nallegations regarding Accuser-3 be stricken as surplusage, or in the alternative, that the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo268l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002683.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of l6\n\nIn addition to the allegations regarding Accuser-l, the indictment includes factual\nallegations regarding Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with two other individuals, Accuser-2 and\nAccuser-3, some of which are characterized as “overt acts” in furtherance of the two\nconspiracies. Ms. Maxwell is not alleged, houever, to have enticed or otherwise caused either\nAccuser-2 or Accuser-3 to travel.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 allegedly took place entirely in London,\nEngland, where Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have “groomed and befriended” Accuser-3 “between\napproximately l994 and l995.” Jd. § 7c. Ms. Maxwell allegedly introduced Accuser-3 to\nEpstein and arranged for “multiple interactions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein,” during which\nMs. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage Epstein, knouing that Epstein would engage\nin sex acts with [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd.\n\nAlthough the indictment alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3 during the\nmassages (id.), it does not allege that Epstein’s interactions with Accuser-3 were nonconsensual\nor in violation of any English law. Notably, Ms. Maxwell is not alleged to have met Accuser-3\nand introduced her to Epstein until l994 at the earliest, by which time Accuser-3 had reached age\nl6°—the legal age of consent in England. Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 § 9 (Eng.), 2oo3, c. 42.\nThus, it appears that the “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 that the indictment alleges was lawful\nconduct.\n\nNor does the indictment allege any travel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce\nor otherwise, let alone as a result of any action taken by Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else.\nYet Counts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell’s encouragement of Accuser-3 to provide\nmassages to Epstein in the future was somehou an overt act in furtherance of the alleged\n* The government has disclosed that Accuser-3 was born im =—Ses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2683", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l6\n(quoting Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 397 (l957)). Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt act in furtherance of the\nalleged conspiracy depends on the scope of the alleged conspiracy.\n\nIn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), for example, the defendant\nwas charged with conspiracy, and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election\nCommission, in connection with an alleged scheme to obtain illegal campaign contributions from\nforeign donors. The defendant moved to strike references in the indictment to acts of\nconcealment of the alleged conspiracy. The court expressed concern that “the allegations\nprovide litle detail about the acts” and that “references to the alleged acts of concealment and\ncover-up suggest the inclusion of offenses that are not part of the conspiracy charged in the\nindictment.” /d. at 25. Although the court denied the defendant’s motion to strike, it ordered a\nbill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement and in particular\nwhether and hou the acts of concealment alleged in the indictment were within the scope of the\nconspiracy charged.” /d. at 33. The court added that if the bill of particulars confirmed the\ndefendant’s assertion that the alleged acts of concealment and cover-up were not within the\nalleged scope of the conspiratorial agreement, her motion to strike would be granted. /d. at 26.\n\nHere, the object of the alleged conspiracies—necessarily, under the Mann Act—was not\nto cause any individual to engage in unlawful sex acts with Epstein, but to cause individuals to\ntravel to do so. The allegations regarding Accuser-3, even if proven, could not have furthered\nsuch alleged conspiracies. There is no basis for any reasonable inference that Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 in England furthered a conspiracy to cause Accuser-l,\nAccuser-2, or anyone else to travel. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 even knew Accuser-l\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2687", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 23\ngovernment, but have not been able to agree on a disclosure schedule and therefore renew this\nrequest as part of this motion for a bill of particulars.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s efforts to prepare for trial have also been significantly impaired by the\nlack of specificity in the indictment. In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a bill of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit concluded that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574. Asa result, Bortnovsky held, “[t]he relevance of key events was\nshrouded in mystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial.” Jd. at 575.\n\nMs. Maxwell is similarly hindered. The indictment charges Ms. Maxwell with enticing\nor arranging travel for an unidentified individual, Accuser-l,* from Florida to New York at some\npoint during a four-year period. Yet the government has not alleged the dates of Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged interactions with Accuser-l, the dates when Accuser-l allegedly traveled across state\nlines for the purpose of engaging in sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, the dates on which\nMs. Maxwell allegedly enticed the complainant to do so, and the actions Ms. Maxwell allegedly\ntook to entice Accuser-l to travel. Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in discovery. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3.

As a result of that review, the\nGovernment has learned that agents assigned to the FBI New York Office assisted the FBI Florida\nOffice by contacting and interviewing or atempting to interview, at the direction of the FBI Florida\nOffice, four witnesses in the New York area between approximately 2oo7 and 2oo8 during the\nFlorida Investigation. These interviews, as noted, were done at the direction of the FBI Florida\nOffice—no separate New York FBI investigation was opened at that time—and consistent with\nthat, any notes or FBI 3o2s documenting the interviews were then kept in the FBI Florida Office\nfile. The Government is not aware of any indication that the FBI New York Office had any\ninvolvement in presenting the Florida case to a grand jury, developing prosecutorial strategy,\natending court proceedings, or making any charging decisions in the case.\n\nThe Government understands that it is not uncommon for an FBI Field Office to provide\nthis sort of ancillary support without becoming a part of the prosecution team. Indeed, it appears\nfrom the FBI Florida Office’s file that the FBI Florida Office contacted numerous other FBI\noffices, including offices in New Mexico, Australia, and Colombia, to seek similar assistance.\nThose other FBI offices similarly had no apparent involvement in the case beyond assisting in\ncontacting and interviewing witnesses in their regions.

See, e.g., Indictment\n§{ 7(a) (“MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-l on multiple occasions at\nEpstein’s residences.”). Accordingly, a rational juror, after hearing the evidence, could find that\nthe question called for the names of minors that the defendant interacted with at any of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s properties, that the defendant answered that she was aware of no such minors other than\nGiuffre, and therefore that her answer was false. And even if the defendant identifies some\nplausible ambiguity—and she has not—the terms in this question are ones “with a meaning about\nwhich [people] of ordinary intellect could agree,” and therefore are not fundamentally ambiguous.\nLighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (internal quotation marks omited).\n\nThe defendant points out that, in response to an earlier question asking her to list the\nunderage girls she “met and brought” to Epstein’s house, she said that she could not do so. (Def.\nMot. 4 at l2-l3). She argues that the charged question was “improper” because it asked her to\ngenerate a list “from events that had happened nearly two decades previously.” (/d.). Her\nunpersuasive after-the-fact efforts to justify her answer provide no basis to keep this question from\nthe jury. As noted above, the transcript makes clear (and a jury could find) that when the defendant\ndid not understand or could not answer a question, she said so. To the extent the defendant is\narguing that her answer was literally true, a reasonable jury could find otherwise. In this respect,\nthe Government notes, among other things, that in response to the earlier question, the defendant\nsaid that she could not make a list not because she could not remember events from that long ago\nbut “because that list -- it never happened that I can think of.” (Ex. lo at 382:4-l3) (emphasis\nadded).

Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9.

There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any reference to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 239\nGovernment further expects Minor Victim-3 will testify that Pe\ndefendant’s intent, in her initial interactions with Minor Victim-3, to entice Minor Victim-3 to\ntravel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.°® Thus, even if Minor Victim-\n3 did not travel as a minor, the events involving Minor Victim-3 outlined in the Indictment\nconstitute direct and admissible evidence of the agreements between and the relationship of the\ndefendant and Epstein. Because evidence regarding Minor Vitim-3 is therefore relevant and\nadmissible at trial, there is no basis to strike these allegations from the Indictment. See Scarpa,\n9l3 F.2d at lol3. Given the relevance of these allegations, the defendant has not satisfied the\n“exacting” standard required to justify striking portions of an Indictment. Murgio, 2o9 F. Supp.\n3d at 724 (quoting Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 6lo). Accordingly, the motion should be denied, or,\nat the very least, deferred until “presentation of the Government’s evidence at trial” after which\nthe Court will have a full understanding of hou Minor Victim-3’s experiences fit into the charged\nconspiracies. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d at 467.\n\nThe fact that the Government would be precluded, by virtue of the statute of limitations,\nfrom bringing a charge based exclusively on the experience of Minor Victim-3 is immaterial. It is\nwell-established that a prosecution for a conspiracy is timely so long as the conspiracy exists and\nat least one timely overt act is commited in furtherance of the conspiracy within the applicable\nstatute of limitations. See United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 6l4 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (citing\nGrunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 39l, 396-97 (l957)); United States v.

LaFlam, 369 F.3d l53, l56 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\n\nHere, evidence regarding the defendant’s interactions with Minor Victim-3 is admissible\nto prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi, all of which are permissible\npurposes under Rule 4o4(b). Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used massage to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and acceptable. “The similarity sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003142.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o8 of 239\neC\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee\nee and the Government has provided the defense with the\nbirth month and year of each minor victim.”\n\nIn other words, as the Government has previously indicated, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about the three minor victims to permit her to\nprepare for trial. The discovery also provides the defense the ability to identify specific private\nplane flights that are relevant to the Indictment.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an imvestigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l4 of 348\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 348\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3366", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003367.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\na residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3376", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25o of 348\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou call, please provide the.file number located af tha top of this leter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”*\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned. n late Janua , as Villafafia and the ria orney prepared to participate\n\ngned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villaf: d the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participat\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”°°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\nane Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3432", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3462", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003463.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” 4\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information).

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.”” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 (Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3483", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003485.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003487.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA.

The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government nou concedes that when it alleges that Epstein “sexually abused”\nAccuser-3 with Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and assistance, the purported “sexual abuse” to which\nthe government refers was entirely lawful conduct—and that the sole basis for the government’s\ncharacterization of that lawful conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “subjective\nexperience” of consensual sex acts. Opp. l62 n.57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,\ngrossly misleading. As the government argued in a 2ol7 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual\nabuse” implies a crime. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)\n(“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i/legal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger\nthan l8 years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Merriam-Webster’s legal\ndictionary defines “sexual abuse” as (l) “the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by\nforcible compulsion,” (il) “engaging in sexual contact with a person who is belou a specified age\nor who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity,” or (i)\n“the crime of engaging in or inflicting sexual abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com\nLegal Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps:/(www.merriam-webster.com/legal/sexual%2oabuse,\naccessed ll Mar. 2o2l.\n\nAlthough the government concedes its inability to establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\ninteractions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful, it\ninsists that it has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading\nnor prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. l65.

At Minimum, the Government Must Demonstrate the Admissibility of Evidence\n\nRegarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nThe government apparently does not dispute its obligation to demonstrate the\nadmissibility of Accuser-3’s testimony as “other act” evidence under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\nLitigation of the admissibility of this evidence is premature, and Ms. Maxwell reserves the right\nto challenge it at the appropriate juncture. Ms. Maxwell notes, houever, that the government’s\nargument that such evidence is admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) suffers from the same\nflaws as its argument that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions regarding Accuser-3 constitute an overt\nact.\n\nThe government claims Accuser-3’s testimony is admissible to shou Ms. Maxwell’s\n“knouledge, intent, and modus operandi.” Opp. l58 (emphasis in original). The government’s\nvery use of those terms, houever, betrays an implication that Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with\nAccuser-3 were somehou unlawful. Any knouledge or intent on Ms. Maxwell’s part that\nEpstein would engage in consensual sexual activity with Accuser-3, or any method by which she\npurportedly persuaded Accuser-3 to engage in such lawful conduct, has no bearing on whether\nMs. Maxwell knew or intended Accuser-l or Accuser-2 to engage in unlawful sexual activity.\nAnd Accuser-3’s proffered testimony about her “subjective experience” of her lawful,\nconsensual activity with Epstein certainly would not inform the jury as to Ms. Maxwell’s state of\nmind or conduct with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Ms. Maxwell is prepared to brief these\nissues more fully in connection with her evidentiary motions.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4225", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004271.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 6 of 32\nee. facilitated her sexual abuse, and it was | Epstein himself—not\nMs. Maxwell—who purportedly called her to schedule massage appointments, sent her gifts, and\nencouraged her to recruit other young females to provide massages to Epstein.

Instead, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement\n(“NPA”) in order to “resolve globally” his oun criminal exposure and to immunize and\nany other “potential co-conspirators.” As part of the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to\nstate prostitution offenses and register as a federal sex offender. He also agreed, in a novel\narrangement, to pay for atorneys to represent his victims in civil lawsuits against him and to\nwaive his right to contest damages up to an agreed-upon setlement amount.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.® Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\ni In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\n8 OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004308.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\na 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstetn’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation imto those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR- oooo43o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l2 of 349\n\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 349\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l4 of 349\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5 of 349\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6 of 349\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l9l of 349\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4488", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l92 of 349\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4489", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2ol of 349\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4498", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l2 of 349\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the... bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\nad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25l of 349\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde the file number located af the top of this lelter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\n\nA48 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[n]othing was provided.”\noe Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, 4lol June 6, 2ol7).\n\n23o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4554", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 283 of 349\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4584", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004585.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 288 of 349\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*°\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*°”\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafaia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerming her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o2 of 349\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and .. . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4599", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o7 of 349\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI] agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004605.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o8 of 349\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 (Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, t appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3lo of 349\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l2 of 349\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l3 of 349\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\n286\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004730.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page 23 of 26\ndetail as to the Government’s theory of the case and the nature of the proof that will underlie the\ncharges at trial”).\n\nMoreover, the discovery in this case has provided the defense with even more information\nregarding the charges contained in Counts Five and Six, thus providing another basis on which to\ndeny this motion. To assist the defense in reviewing this discovery, the same day that the S2\nIndictment was returned, the Government provided the defense with a list of particular Bates\nranges that relate specifically to Minor Victim-4 and the charges contained in Counts Five and Six.\nAs a result, the Government has identified particularly relevant pieces of evidence regarding these\ncharges for the defense. (See Dkt. No. l88 at 3-4). This evidence includes, among other things,\nportions of message pads seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence referencing messages left\nby Minor Victim-4 during the period charged in Counts Five and Six; phone records reflecting\ncalls made by another Epstein employee to Minor Victim-4; Federal Express records reflecting a\nshipment from Epstein’s address in New York to Minor Victim-4; and contemporary photographs\nof Minor Victim-4. The Government has also provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s birth\nmonth and year. Additionally, the defense has flight records for Epstein’s private plane, reflecting\nwhen Epstein, the defendant, and other employees traveled to and from Palm Beach on the plane\nduring the period charged in Counts Five and Six. In other words, the discovery provides the\ndefendant with more than sufficient information about Minor Victim-4 to permit her to prepare for\ntrial.\n\nSimilar to the other three minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment, any remaining\ndetail regarding the specifics of abuse and particular interactions will come from witness\ntestimony. As is to be expected when describing events more than a decade in the past, that\ntestimony will provide approximate time periods when events occurred, rather than specific dates.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo473o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 26\nGiven the information the defendant already has from the Indictment and discovery, any additional\ndetail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act production. The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its disclosure obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, houever, such prior statements are classic\nimpeachment material that need only be produced sufficiently in advance of trial to permit the\ndefense adequate time to make use of them. See United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44, l46\n7 Although Minor Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion\nmakes clear that she strongly suspects Minor Victim-4’s identity, there is no basis at this time to\nrequire the Government to turn over the names of its witnesses, including its victim-witnesses in\nadvance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo473l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo Filed o7/o2/2l Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Believing that he no\nlonger had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions\nin a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions.

Ten years later, the successor District Atorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to\ncharge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were\ncovered by DA Castor’s promise.

Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.\n(Id. at 38).\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that\nDA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due\nProcess rights.

(/d. at 79).\nIn so holding, the Court noted the follouing:\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including\ncircumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some promise or\nassurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due\nprocess and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more\nstrongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal writen agreement, as opposed to\nan informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental\nfairness.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the\nprinciples discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss\nCounts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo48ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004822.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page lo of 8o\nhad sexual intercourse on any occasion.

After Cosby provided his writen answers, police officers\nsearched his Cheltenham residence and found no evidence that, in their view, could be\nused to confirm or corroborate Constand’s allegations. Follouing the search of Cosby’s\nhome, Constand was interviewed by police again. D.A. Castor noted that there were\ninconsistences in that interview, which further impaired Constand’s credibility in his eyes.\nHe also learned that, before she contacted the police in Canada, Constand had contacted\ncivil atorneys in Philadelphia, likely for the purpose of pursuing financial compensation in\na lawsuit against Cosby.\n\nAdditionally, according to D.A. Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A. Castor found these recurring interactions between a complainant and\nan alleged perpetrator to be atypical. D.A. Castor also reasoned that the recordings likely\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4822", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004840.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 28 of 8o\nfor the sexual assault crime in the Constand case.” N.T., 2/2/2ol6, at 224-25.

Instead, the trial court\nconsidered the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> between the former district atorney and Cosby to be an\nincomplete and unauthorized contemplation of transactional immunity. The trial court\nfound no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer\ntransactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court\nnoted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s\nimmunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947.4 Per the terms of the statute,\na The immunity statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in\n\nall proceedings before:\n\n(l) Courts.\n\n(b) Request and issuance.--The Atorney General or a district atorney\n\nmay request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and\n\nthat judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the Atorney\n\nGeneral or district atorney:\n\n(l) the testimony or other information from a witness may be\nnecessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide\nother information on the basis of his privilege against self-\nincrimination.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo484o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 5o of 8o\nlaw, .. . appellate courts have the pouer to draw their oun inferences and make their oun\ndeductions and conclusions.” /n re Pruner's Est., l62 A.2d 626, 63l (Pa. l96o) (citations\nomited).\n\nHere, the trial court presided over the habeas corpus hearing, viewing and hearing\nthe witnesses and their testimonies first-hand. From that vantage point, the trial court\ndetermined that, as a mater of fact, D.A. Castor had not extended a formal promise to\nCosby never to prosecute him, let alone consummated a formal non-prosecution\nagreement with Cosby. The factual basis for the court’s findings was two-fold. First, the\ncourt characterized the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> between the district atorney and Cosby as a failed\natempt to reach a statutorily prescribed transactional immunity agreement. Second, the\ncourt concluded that the former district atorney's testimony regarding the legal\nrelationship between him and Cosby was inconsistent and “equivocal at best.” T.C.O. at\n63. Both findings are supported adequately by the record.\n\nPursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947, when a prosecutor wishes to formalize an immunity\nagreement, he or she “may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated\ncourt.” /d. § 5947(b). Presented with such a request, the petitioned court “shall issue\nsuch an order,” id., upon which a witness “may not refuse to testify based on his privilege\nagainst self-incrimination.” /d. § 5947(c). At the habeas hearing, former District Atorney\nCastor testified that he intended to provide Cosby with transactional immunity. He\nexplained that this conferral was predicated upon the state’s common-law authority as a\nsovereign rather than any statutory provisions or protocols. T.C.O. at 5/7 (citing N.T.,\n2/2/2ol6, at 232, 234, 236). The record does not contradict his testimony.

The applicability of\ncontract law to aspects of the criminal law has been recognized by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States, see Pucket v. United States, 556 U.S. l29, l37 (2oo9), by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, see McKeever v. Warden SCI-Graterford,\n486 F.3d 8l, 86 (3d Cir. 2oo7), and by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Martinez, l47\nA.3d 5l7, 53l (Pa. 2ol6). In order to succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, the\naggrieved party must prove that: (l) the promisor acted in a manner that he or she should\nhave reasonably expected to induce the other party into taking (or not taking) certain\naction; (2) the aggrieved party actually took such action; and (3) an injustice would result\nif the assurance that induced the action was not enforced. See Crouse v.

As suggested by\nthe trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable\nin the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The prosecutor\nenjoys “tremendous” discretion to wield “the pouer to decide whether to initiate formal\ncriminal proceedings, to select those criminal charges which will be filed against the\naccused, to negotiate plea bargains, to withdraw charges where appropriate, and,\nultimately, to prosecute or dismiss charges at trial.” Clancy, l92 A.3d at 53. Unless\npatently abused, this vast discretion is exercised generally beyond the reach of judicial\ninterference. See Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295 (noting that “the ultimate discretion to file\ncriminal charges lies in the district atorney”).\n\nWhile the prosecutor’s discretion in charging decisions is undoubtedly vast, it is\nnot exempt from basic principles of fundamental fairness, nor can it be wielded in a\nmanner that violates a defendant's rights. The foregoing precedents make clear that, at\na minimum, when a defendant relies to his or her detriment upon the acts of a prosecutor,\nhis or her due process rights are implicated. See, e.g., Santobello, Baird, and Scotland,\nsupra.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article |, Section\n9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution mandate that all interactions between the government\nand the individual are conducted in accordance with the protections of due process.

Even if the local rules somehou applied to undersigned counsel, the\n\nOp-Ed did not violate the local rule.\n\nEven if the local rule applies to a lawyer who does not currently represent a party\nor a witness and has never appeared in the trial court, the opinion piece here did not\nviolate the rule.\n\nFirst, there is no risk of danger or prejudice to the upcoming trial because the\nOp-Ed raised the same argument — that the Cosby decision applied to Ms. Maxwell’s\ncase — that was filed in public pleadings that were quoted by the press. No confidential\ninformation was disclosed.2 Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument\nin a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 3lo). In that public\npleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was\n\nenforceable and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later\n\non the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a\n\nresult, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,\n\nthe Court noted the follouing:\n\nInteractions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant,\nincluding circumstances where the later seeks enforcement of some\npromise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the\ndictates of due process and fundamental fairness.\n\n(Id. at 55).\n\nThe same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5872", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005880.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo588o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005899.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005931.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 45\nAlaggia et al. 279\nTable 2.

A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5977", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 52\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s opinions are thus unreliable, the government says: “If the\nvictim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the\nperpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim\nfor abuse by a third party.” Resp. at 26.\n\nHardly. It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse\nanyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was “grooming.” The government\nthus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more\nnefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably.

Consent in sexual situa-\ntions is often implied, sometimes by the absence of a negative (‘She didn’t\nsay no or move away”) or inferred (‘She seems to be enjoying this” or\n“We did this in the past so I assumed she was ok with it”). Hickman and\nMuehlenhard (l999) found that nonverbal tactics were used more often than\nverbal consent. Consent is thought to involve both knouledge of what is\nbeing consented to and a belief that the person is free to either assent\nor not. Thus, a claim of lack of consent can also come from the person’s\n“feeling trapped” or “coerced,” which, again, the two parties may interpret\ndifferently. Houever, mistakes can be made in these situations and given\nthe motivations of the parties, these mistakes can be motivated (“I want this,\nso I interpret her silence as consent” or “She was free to leave at anytime;\nI was on top of her because I thought she wanted that”).\n\nUnderstanding whether consent was given is made more complex by\nthe fact that consent early in the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> for a certain kind of sexual\ncontact is not consent for any and all further sexual contact in that episode.\nIn addition, consent for the same act (consent last week) is not consent for all\nfuture contact. This complexity led to the infamous Antioch College consent\npolicy that stated that there were multiple levels of sexual intimacy and\nevery time someone wants to proceed to another level, they must explicitly\nask and receive explicit verbal permission to proceed to this level (Francis,\nl996):\n\nIf the level of sexual intimacy increases during an <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> (.e., if two\n\npeople move from kissing while fully clothed—which is one level—to\n\nundressing for direct physical contact, which is another level), the people\ninvolved need to express their clear verbal consent before moving to that\n\nnew level. If one person wants to initiate moving to a higher level of\n\nsexual intimacy in an <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>, that person is responsible for geting the\n\nverbal consent of the otber person(s) involved before moving to that level.\n\n(p. l37)\n\nThis policy was critiqued on the grounds of its impracticality, but it\nraises the question hou explicit and hou often does consent need to be\nconveyed? This ambiguity creates a pathway for a false allegation in which\nthe alleged victim engaged in behaviors that can plausibly be interpreted\nas providing consent, but the victim herself may not understand or realize\nthis. Thus, a false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe\nconsent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nthat occurred while he or she was under the influence or while experienc-\ning the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may atempt to make\nsense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events\nthat occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor financial obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\nDiagnostic criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway. If an individual with antisocial personality disorder is likely to lie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l7 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll\n\natention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever,\n\nwhen considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-\n\nviduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical\n\nassault (Lieb, et al., 2oo4) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.\n\nThus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented\n\nin an allegation of sexual assault.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) defines histrionic\n\npersonality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and atention-\n\nseeking behavior” (p. 7ll). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%\n\nof the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2oo7; American\n\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five\n\nor more of the follouing diagnostic criteria:\n\nl) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of\natention;\n\n2) <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually\nseductive or provocative behavior;\n\n3) displays rapidly shifting and shallou expressions;\n\n4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw atention to the self;\n\n5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in\ndetail;\n\n6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of\nemotion;\n\n7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are\n\n(p. 7l4).\n\nThe primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic\ncriteria l, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency\nto play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may\nfollou periods in which they received litle atention (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2ooo).\n\nFiling a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals\nwith histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-\nized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to\nsexual relationships that may be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with\na person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault\nclaim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or from other\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l8 of 29\n\nLl2 J. Engle and W. O’Donobue\n\nindividuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-\nulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\nintentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 29\n\nl22 J.

Usually in a lou-key, nonforcible fashion, possibly by\npresenting the activity as a game or something that is ‘special’ and fun.\nThis always entails misrepresentation of moral standards, either verbally\nor implicitly... . Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children. Grooming is a conscious,\ndeliberate, and carefully orchestrated approach used by the offender.\nThe goal of grooming is to permit a sexual encounter and keep it a\nsecret.”\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6797", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l3 of 43\n968 N. Bennet and W. O’Donobue\nrelationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time\nwith their child.\n\nVan Dam (2ool) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-\ning the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing\nany children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-\nchological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,\nthey may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by shouing up uninvited to a\nchild’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.\nThe parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have\nthus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier\nfor the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with\nthe children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it\nwould go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party\nwhen the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,\ncognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their\nbeliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of leting their chil-\ndren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good\nperson). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will\ntend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about\nthe offender.\n\nCommonialities\nThe two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the\nempirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-\nior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary\nviolation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing\nan <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)\nthe function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that\nthe adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to\nthem, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them\nto nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different\ntopographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior\nis removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-\ning the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the\nlikelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nA PROPOSED DEFINITION\nAny definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about\ncommon strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the\nmost useful definition of grooming would atempt to instantiate the follouing\ndefinitional meta-criteria:\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006824.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 43\n288 — S. Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon.

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006856.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 45\nAlaggia et al. 279\nTable 2.

In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo69o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 52\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s opinions are thus unreliable, the government says: “If the\nvictim experienced atachment and grooming, it makes no analytical difference whether the\nperpetrator intends to engage in sexual contact with the victim or, instead, is preparing the victim\nfor abuse by a third party.” Resp. at 26.\n\nHardly. It makes all the difference in the world because Ms. Maxwell is on trial, not Mr.\nEpstein. The logic (such as it is) of grooming evidence is that the perpetrator normalizes sexual\nbehavior to facilitate his later abuse of the victim. But because Ms. Maxwell did not abuse\nanyone, there is no basis to conclude that anything she did was “grooming.” The government\nthus intends to have Rocchio characterize innocent conduct by Ms. Maxwell as something more\nnefarious, thereby further blurring the line that experts are already unable to draw reliably. Resp.\nEx. A, p 2 (“There is a lack of consensus regarding exactly what [the grooming] process entails\nand hou it is clearly distinguished from normal adult—child interactions.”).\n\nThe government’s additional arguments fail.\n\ne <A psychologist who treats alleged victims of abuse but does not treat alleged\nperpetrators is nothing like a urologist who treats urology patients.

The urologist, by contrast,\nhas scientific means to verify what her patients tell her, and there isn’t another\nperson whose side of the story she needs to hear.\n\ne The government repeatedly says that “courts have frequently admited testimony\nabout the psychological relationship between victims of sexual abuse and their\nperpetrators.” Resp. at l3.

Ms.\nMaxwell rejects the government’s unsupported conclusory statements about when and if she\ninteracted with Ms. Maxwell and her ability to do so absent suggestion.\n\nWhen the prosecution offers testimony from an eyewitness to identify the defendant as a\nperpetrator of the offense, fundamental fairness requires that that identification testimony be\nreliable. Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d l22, l33 (2d Cir. 2ool). The court must first determine\nwhether the pretrial identification procedures unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the\ndefendant was the perpetrator. If the court finds, houever, that the procedures were suggestive, it\nmust then determine whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. Jd.\n\nThe critical question here, ignored by the government, is not whether yy Anew\nthat she was accusing Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o (she undoubtably was) but whether she could\nidentify Ms. Maxwell as the person she was nou claiming abused her. Of the pictures selected\nhere, SG bad a high probability of picking Ms. Maxwell -- even then, she was\ntentative about one person who was not Ms. Maxwell. The shou up was neither confirmatory nor\nfair.\n\nThe protection against unduly suggestive procedures encompass not only the right to\navoid improper police methods that suggest the initial identification, but as well the right to\navoid having suggestive methods transform a selection that was only tentative into one that is\npositively certain. Solomon v. Smith, 645 F.2d ll79, ll85 (2d Cir. l98l).\n\nMs. Maxwell has met her burden of demonstrating the shou up was unduly suggestive.\nUnder these circumstances the Court should next consider the well knou “five factors”: (l) the\nwitness's opportunity to observe the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the degree of the\nwitness's atention at that time, (3) the accuracy of the witness's initial description of the\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo692o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 47 of 52\nprejudice because the [witness's] choice of language implied that he and the prosecution believed\nthe complainant's testimony.\" Jd.\n\nFor these and the previously stated reasons, Ms. Maxwell asks the Court to order that the\nparties, the witnesses, and the Court use individuals’ names in the presence of the jury.\nXIU.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007519.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 26 of 375\n--Reprinted in: Honeck, R.P.

So we knou, because of the\n\nl3 vulnerability literature, that if somebody is being abused in\nl4 adolescence, it wouldn't be at all unusual for them also to\n\nl5 have a history of earlier childhood sexual abuse.\n\nl6 So I have to look at the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> of those prior\n\nl7 vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities\nl8 both may have made the individual more vulnerable to the\n\nl9 grooming behavior and to the subsequent sexual abuse, and also\n2o ways in which those prior vulnerabilities may have interacted\n2l with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for the\n22 individual I'm evaluating.\n23 Q.

Previous research has found that two\nof the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were atention-seeking and\nrevenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship\npartner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase,\nnewly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage\nin behaviors that are viewed as “manipulative.” Manipulative behaviors are often outside the\nconscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as\nmanipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual\nwith BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some\ndesired outcome.\n\nHistrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder\ninclude: l) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of atention; 2)\ninteractions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or\nprovocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallou expressions; 4) consistently uses\nphysical appearance to draw atention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively\nimpressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shous self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated\nexpression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and\n8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors\ninclude the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense\ndesire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follou periods in which\nthey received litle atention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit\nindividuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized\nbehavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that\nmay be used to seek atention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about\nit). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost atention, either from the desired partner or\nfrom other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a\nperson who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of atention received for filing a\nsexual assault charge and for the “victim” role that can be played out in other relationships (a\ndynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In\ntimes when atention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.\n\nDelirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in\ncognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to\nthis pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations,\nillusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive\ndoses.\n\nPsychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by\ndelusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross\nimpairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions\nthat are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some\ncases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim\nadamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page l6 of 42\n\n2o.

Ms. Maxwell is not asking\nquestions about confidential communications between Carolyn and her atorney. She is asking\nquestions primarily about Mr. Scarola’s interactions with the government. To the extent the\nanswers to Ms. Maxwell’s questions allude to any statements made by Carolyn, those statements\nare not confidential because they were made in the presence of, or with the understanding that\nthey would be disclosed to, a third party—the government. And all this testimony is relevant to\nestablish the timeline of Carolyn’s cooperation with the government and her motive and bias in\ntestifying against Ms. Maxwell, in particular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and\nuncooperative until there was the prospect of a payout from the EVCP.\n\nUnless put at issue by the government during cross-examination, Ms. Maxwell does not\nintend to ask Mr. Scarola any questions about any communications between Carolyn and Mr.\nScarola, or other employees working with Mr. Scarola, concerning the above referenced email or\nphone discussions between Mr. Scarola and the government.\n\nThe government has not met its burden of proving the atorney-client privilege applies.\nAny statements about forwarding messages to Carolyn were not made for the purpose of\nobtaining legal advice nor intended to be kept confidential.

The jury likely determined that the only corroborating\nevidence linking Ms. Maxwell to the New Mexico trip was a flight log shouing that she was\npresent on the trip but said nothing about whether she “persuaded, induced, enticed, or coerced”\nJane to take the trip. Indeed, Jane did not testify about having any <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with Ms. Maxwell\nprior to the flight to New Mexico in which they discussed the trip.

The Court’s response to refer\nthe jurors to the existing instructions was insufficient because the jury charge, which had been\nstripped of any mention of “travel to New York,” did not adequately instruct the jury that a\nconviction on Count Four could not be based solely on sexual abuse in New Mexico or any other\njurisdiction outside of New York.

(PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by\nthe record. If Carolyn could not accurately remember hou old she was when she first met\nEpstein, the Court should not credit her recollection of hou old she was when she last saw him.\n\nCarolyn’s memory of when she stopped seeing Epstein was not only unreliable, but also\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last\ninteractions with Epstein were when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on\nMarch l4, 2oo4. (Tr. l548-49). Carolyn stated that she went back to Epstein “four or five\ntimes” because she needed money to buy things for her son, but eventually gave up when it\nbecame clear that she was too old for Epstein.

Accordingly, the trial\n* Carolyn’s memory of her interactions with Epstein around the time of the Georgia interlude was also inconsistent\nand contradictory. On the one hand, Carolyn testified that she left Florida in 2oo3 “to escape the traumatic events”\nthat had happened in Palm Beach and traveled to Georgia where she became pregnant with her child. (Tr. l548-49,\nl6l7, l668). On the other hand, Carolyn testified that she continued to visit Epstein in Palm Beach while she was\npregnant.

(PSR § 36). When Jane was still only l4 years old, the defendant and Epstein instructed\nJane to follou them to Epstein’s bedroom where the defendant and Epstein fondled each other,\ncasually giggling about it, while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (PSR § 34). While this\nwas happening, “there were hands everywhere,” Epstein began to masturbate, and the defendant\nrubbed, kissed, and fondled Epstein. (/d.). After this initial sexual <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>, the defendant and\nEpstein continued to sexually abuse Jane. (PSR § 35). The defendant and Epstein taught Jane\nhou Epstein liked to be massaged and gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis.

Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3. Nou, defendant Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal\ninvolvement in this far-research conspiracy. Kate clearly has a right to be heard as part of that\nprocess.\n\nAs this Court is aware, Kate was recognized in this case as a crime victim of a federally\ncharged criminal conspiracy against Ghislaine Maxwell for acts that Maxwell commited against\nKate when she was seventeen years old. While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel. No doubt, Kate has important insight into Maxwell’s role in a sex-\ntrafficking organization, the type that is helpful for any Court tasked with determining an\nappropriate sentence.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo738", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o _ Filed ll/l9/2l Page4of23\n\nThe probative value of the anticipated testimony must of course be balanced with any\npotential prejudice under Rule 4o3. As the Court noted at the November l conference, there is a\nrisk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is\ndescribing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of\nthis witness to the age of consent. Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at 89-9o. There is also the risk that the jury\nmay convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the\nlack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. Houever, the Court\nconcludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,\nthe testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.\n\nAs to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is\nprecluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding\nthe sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,\nany prejudice fon i described above is substantially diminished\nby limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with the witness and testimony\nindicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual\nactivity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be\nunduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct\nwould be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct\nand any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony\ncannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the\nGovernment phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011114.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69o_ Filed ll/l9/2l Page6of23\nthis evidence as to the sex trafficking counts, the witness is precluded from testifying that [il\n\nThe Court thus draws the line described above for limiting Witness-3’s testimony.\nPermiting the entirety of the proffered testimony carries a risk that the jury may convict Ms.\nMaxwell due to conduct that cannot form the basis of a conviction for the charged crimes. But\nby limiting the testimony to the few categories of relevant testimony outlined above, the\nprejudice is substantially minimized.\n\nMoreover, whether as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts or offered for a proper\npurpose under 4o4(b), this testimony must be paired with a proper limiting instruction to guard\nagainst potential juror confusion. The Defense has submited proposed limiting instructions, and\nthe Government agrees that some sort of instruction is appropriate, although it disagrees with the\nbasis for the instruction. Dkt. No. 452 at 5o n.l2; Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). In\naccordance with this ruling, the Court proposes the follouing instruction before this anticipated\nwitness testifies:\n\nYou will hear testimony from the next witness about interactions that she says she had\n\nwith the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over the\n\nrelevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any sexual conduct she says occurred\nwith Mr. Epstein was not “illegal sexual activity” as the Government has charged in the\n\nIndictment. I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment. To the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before\n\nyou, you may consider it. Houever, you may not convict the Defendant on the basis of\n\nthe testimony regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein. Nor\nmay you consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor Ms.\n\nMaxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the Indictment.\nThe Court also proposes the follouing instruction before any testimony by other witnesses\nregarding sexual activity that occurred after the relevant age of consent:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct that\n\nshe says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico].

A sophisticated adult\nlo woman, she provided an initial venire of responsibility and\n\nll even safety. She befriended and developed relationships of\n\nl2 trust. She then manipulated the victims and normalized sexual\nl3 abuse through her involvement, encouragement, and instruction.\nl4 To give one example from trial, Jane testified that\n\nl5 Ms. Maxwell cultivated a friendship with her, took her to\n\nl6 movies and shopping. In an initial sexual <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>, while\nl7 Jane was l4 years old, the defendant engaged in sexual conduct\nl8 with Epstein while Jane was present. After that, the defendant\nl9 instructed Jane, again, while she was only l4 years old, on hou\n2o to massage Epstein, including instructions on hou to touch his\n2l penis during massages. The abuse later escalated to Epstein\n22 using vibrators on Jane, penetrating her with his fingers.\n23 During some of the sexual abuse, the defendant would herself\n24 touch Jane's breasts.\n25 Carolyn, the victim of the sex trafficking charge,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.«*\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll6o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 84 of lo6 97\nLBTCMAX4 Visoski - direct\nl plane between l994 and 2oo4?\n2 A.

Could you explain the difference between flying on a\nl8 private plane and flying commercially.\nl9 A. Well, the best advantage is you leave when you want.\n2o Otherwise, flying privately, security is much less. You don't\n2l have TSA, you don't have x-rays, you come and go as you please,\n22 prety much. Some airports even let you drive your car\n23 directly onto the ramp next to the aircraft and unload.

And if memory serves, she\n9 did ride the airlines, as well. And then, it was probably in\nlo the late l99os, she also had an option on a quarter share or a\n\nll private -- or a quarter ounership of a private jet, as well.\nl2 They call it a quarter share.\nl3 Q. What did Ms. Maxwell tell you about that?\nl4 A. That it was her jet, which, in fact, it was, because she\nl5 was partial ouner of the jet and she had access to it with\nl6 notice.\nl7 Q. Could you explain the difference between flying on a\nl8 private plane and flying commercially.\nl9 A. Well, the best advantage is you leave when you want.\n2o Otherwise, flying privately, security is much less. You don't\n2l have TSA, you don't have x-rays, you come and go as you please,\n22 prety much. Some airports even let you drive your car\n23 directly onto the ramp next to the aircraft and unload.

Why not?\n2o A. Like I said, it wasn't a priority. I tried to get their\n2l names. Typically, it was usually the same people that flew, so\n22 I recognized their names with the first introduction.

During that time,\nMaxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest\nassociates.\n\nBeginning in at least l994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played\na key role in Epstein’s abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse\nunderage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor\nvictims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended\nwould result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse.\n\nAs the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in\nmultiple ways. For example, she atempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their\nlives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with\nEpstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who\nseemingly approved of Epstein’s behavior.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020075.jpg": "Cageab2o-ce6oBaGAdsnt Becument loo2 Filed6R238/2thg Page tl Sts 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the combination of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020084.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8BGANt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tgPaAgePasaf 36\nthe media even when a bounty was offered for her location and when numerous media outlets were\nsearching for her.\n\nThe charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not undercut the defendant’s\nskill at evading detection, and do nothing more than restate the justification for those actions that\nthe defense already made at the prior hearing. (See Dkt. l8 at l4-l6). That said, there is still\nreason to believe that the defendant was hiding not just from the press, but also from law\nenforcement. It is undisputed that defense counsel, even while in contact with the Government,\nnever disclosed the defendant’s location or offered her surrender if she were to be charged. (Tr.\n53-54). The Court already inquired about defense counsel’s interactions with the Government in\nthe year leading up to the defendant’s arrest, and the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new\non that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted the Government when the FBI atempted to serve\nthe defendant with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7, 2ol9. Prior to her arrest,\nthe Government and defense counsel communicated on multiple occasions between July and\nOctober of 2ol9, and communicated briefly on two additional occasions, most recently in March\nof 2o2o. At no point did defense counsel disclose the defendant’s location, offer to surrender the\ndefendant, or offer to bring the defendant in to be interviewed.\n\nMoreover it is undisputed that when the FBI located the defendant, she ignored their\ndirectives and ran away from the arresting agents. Although the defense has submited an affidavit\nfrom the defendant’s private security team, nothing in that affidavit should alter the Court’s\ndetermination that detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed the Court at the\nJuly l4, 2o2o bail hearing that the defendant’s security protocol was to move to an inner room if\nher security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit makes clear that the agents who\nentered the defendant’s property were wearing clothing that clearly identified them as FBI agents.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020238.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page4 of 25\n\nfront of a victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being\npresent for sex acts involving a minor victim and Epstein.

Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his\nassistants’ conduct as it was knoun to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as\nDepartment atorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 3o, 2oo8,\nwhen Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to\nthat date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the basis of that subsequent\ninformation.\n\nOPR’s investigation occurred approximately l2 years after most of the significant events\nrelating to the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result,\nmany of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their oun or\nothers’ actions occurring in 2oo6-2oo8, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they\nreviewed at the time.* Houever, OPR’s evaluation of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly\nby extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the\ngovernment and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the\nparticipants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them.\n\nI. OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct\nagainst current or former Department atorneys related to the exercise of their authority to\n7 In August 2ol9, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of\nLaw Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the\ninvestigation focuses on Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program.\n\na OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution\nof, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2ol9. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nVil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021184.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya ae 3536o38, Pagel2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo of 348\ninvestigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.” OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n° 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nvill\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll84", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021185.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye ae 3536o38, Pagel3 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 348\nof immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nix\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021187.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document arya kee 3536o38, Pagel5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3 of 348\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nxil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021189.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel7 of 258\nSA-l5\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5 of 348\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021364.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l9o | 3536o38, Pagel92 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9o of 348\n\nOPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I]f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that .. . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021365.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagel93 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9l of 348\n\nWith regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein. . .\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l365", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021374.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3oo | 3536o38, Page2o2 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2oo of 348\n\nThe sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would of require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l374", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021385.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TT 3536o38, Page2l3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2ll of 348\nmanagers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.°’\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nI. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The Case Agents and Villafaia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021424.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page252 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25o of 348\nif you have additional questions which involve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane. Villafafia responded that she was unable to provide the requested information, but asked that counsel keep\nher updated about the civil litigation.\na8 Villafafia later stated in a July 9, 2oo8 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation that, although she invited\nEdwards to provide her with information, “[nJothing was provided.”\na Edwards did not respond to OPR’s request to interview him, although he did assist OPR in locating other\natorneys who were representing victims.\n\n35o The government later admited in court filings that Villafafia and Edwards “discussed the possibility of\nfederal charges being filed in the future and that the NPA was not mentioned.” Doe, Government’s Response to\nPetitioners’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\nat l4, {lol (June 6, 2ol7).\n23o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021458.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 389 3536o39, Page28 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 282 of 348\n\nAs discussed belou, OPR concludes that none of the subject atorneys violated a clear and\nunambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without\na federal criminal charge. In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l462", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021463.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 387 3536o39, Page33 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 287 of 348\nrequire victim approval of the prosecutors’ plans, but it allous victims the opportunity to express\ntheir views and to be heard before a final decision is made. The lack of consultation in this case\ndenied the victims that opportunity.*”\n\nI. LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\n\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\n\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\n\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\n\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\n\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\n\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\n\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\no8 Villatfafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, 4 B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\n\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\n\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\n\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\n\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\n\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l467", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021477.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3ol 3536o39, Page47 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ol of 348\nthe federal investigation I was cooperating in.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°3\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and... result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s...\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”*** Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\nBas As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\nBA When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nreinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).\nae In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n\n278\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021482.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o6 3536o39, Paged2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o6 of 348\nintentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims.**°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n445 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l482", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021483.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o7 3536o39, Paged3 of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o7 of 348\nVillafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more atention needed\na6 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l483", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021485.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3o9 3536o39, Paged5 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o9 of 348\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l485", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021487.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON STL 3536o39, Paged/7 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3ll of 348\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l487", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021488.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3l) 3536o39, Pageds of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein to select young\n7 victims who were vulnerable. Once selected, Ms. Maxwell played\n8 a pivotal role in facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls\ng through a series of deceptive tactics.

In an initial sexual <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>, while\nl7 Jane was l4 years old, the defendant engaged in sexual conduct\nl8 with Epstein while Jane was present.

OVERVIEW OF OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOPR’s primary mission is to ensure that Department atorneys perform their duties in\naccordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal\nlaw enforcement agency.

Moreover, as the line prosecutor in\nthe Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that\nlitigation in early 2ol9, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions\nto review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR’s request for a writen\nresponse, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these\nmaterials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in\npreparation for their interviews.\n\nvil\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023008.jpg": "investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23oo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023009.jpg": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oo9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023010.jpg": "find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23olo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023011.jpg": "treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23oll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023012.jpg": "VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA.

OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations\nof misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department\natorney’s alleged professional misconduct.\n\nIn its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs\nthe challenged conduct and whether a subject atorney violated that standard. Department\natorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of\ntheir duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by atorney\nlicensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it\nconcludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject atorney violated such a standard\nintentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that\n(l) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the\nsubject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude\nthat a subject atorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional\nmisconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may\nconclude that a subject atorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted\ninappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject atorney’s\nconduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°\nIV. ISSUES CONSIDERED\n\nIn this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to\nthe negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s\ninteractions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets\nof issues are described belou and are analyzed separately in this Report.\n\nA. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA\n\nIn evaluating whether any of the subjects commited professional misconduct, OPR\nconsidered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,\nprofessional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR\nconsidered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (l) charging decisions, (2) declination\nof criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants\n2 28 C.F.R. § o.39a(a)(l). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of atorneys occurring\nduring their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the atorney left the Department before or during\nOPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department\natorneys. Although former Department atorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that\na former Department atorney violated state rules of professional conduct for atorneys could result in a referral to an\nappropriate state atorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct\nof Department atorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.\n\nlo In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after\na preliminary inquiry into the mater. In December 2olo, one of the atorneys representing victims in the CVRA\nlitigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation\nand that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its\nstandard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the\nthen-pending CVRA litigation.\n\nVill\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o22", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023023.jpg": "of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that\nOPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR\nalso examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter\ninto the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,\nsuch as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and\ndiscusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed\nthat shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.\n\nB. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA\n\nTo address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,\nand timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was\nsigned, including victim notification leters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews\nconducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject atorneys violated any clear\nand unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the\ngovernment’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the\ncircumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s\nvictims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.\n\nV. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in\nvarious decisions and events. Acosta, houever, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of\nthe initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\nto the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved\nit, with knouledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknouledged that he approved\nthe NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for\nthe NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall\nresponsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less\nclear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR\nevaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.\n\nA. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA\n\nWith respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects\ndid not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and\napproval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a\nsubject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing\nthe conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict\nEpstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.\nFurthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable\nstandards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\n\nIx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o23", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023024.jpg": "initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023025.jpg": "interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the\nDepartment’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o25", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023026.jpg": "that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\nVI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT\n\nThe Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant\nfederal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal\nconduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.\nOPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense atorneys who interacted with\nthe subjects.\n\nIn Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal\ninvestigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2oo5 by a young\nvictim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law\nenforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2oo6 opening of the federal\ninvestigation; the September 2oo7 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent\nefforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2oo8\nguilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with\nthe terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July\n2olo. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations\nrelating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR\ndescribes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’\nconduct.\n\nChapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s\nfindings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’\nconduct in light of the pertinent standards.\n\nOPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including\ninternal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full\nunderstanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.\n\nXl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o26", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023027.jpg": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nIl.

Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nkK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023202.jpg": "OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with\nLefkouitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense atorneys generally. Villafafia\nacknouledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the\ntone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her\nsupervisors had assigned to her:\n\n[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find\nthat that is hou I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,\nand I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can\nbe when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were\nto engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that\ngiven that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the\nagreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had\nagreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my\nlanguage in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications\nwith Mr. Lefkouitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at\nthe terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,\nmy response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”\n\nVillafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide\nan improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email\nin which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all\nof the other persons that we could charge” was writen in response to a defense proposal to include\nin the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not\nto prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkouitz had proposed that the plea\nagreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the\ninitiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against\n[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-ouned corporate entity] for\nany criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that\nthe USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who\ncould be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. Houever,\nVillafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to\nrequire the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might\nlead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the\ncourt not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the\nonly one to express concern about hou deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether\nsuch probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie\nhad suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allou the USAO more flexibility in plea\nnegotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that\nrequired dismissal of numerous substantive counts.\n\nAs to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkouitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues\nin the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a\n“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate\ncompletion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.\n\nl64\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023203.jpg": "With regard to her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia told OPR that her goal\nwas to protect the anonymity of the victims. She said that the case was far more likely to be\ncovered by the Palm Beach press, which had already writen articles about Epstein, than in Miami,\nand “if [the victims] wanted to atend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into the\ncourthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper.”\n\nIn evaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all the email exchanges between Villafafia, as well\nas Sloman and Acosta, and Lefkouitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted\nfrom the publicly released emails (except for a few to or from Acosta, copies of which OPR did\nnot locate in the USAO records). OPR also considered the emails in the broader context of\nVillafafia’s overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,\nas well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor\nof prosecuting Epstein and worked for months touard that goal. She repeatedly pressed her\nsupervisors for permission to indict Epstein and made numerous efforts to expand the scope of the\ncase. She opposed meetings with the defense team, and nearly withdrew from the case because\nher supervisors agreed to those meetings. Villafafia objected to the decision to resolve the case\nthrough a guilty plea in state court, and she engaged in a lengthy and heated email exchange with\nMenchel about that subject. When she was assigned the task of creating an agreement to effect\nthat resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the ensuing negotiations to hold the USAO’s position\ndespite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.\n\nOPR also considered statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense\ncounsel. Sloman, in particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia “was soft on Epstein...\ncouldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best to implement\nthe decisions that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarly told OPR that\nwhen he read the district court’s February 2ol9 opinion in the CVRA litigation and the emails\nfrom Villafafia cited in that opinion, he was “surprised to see hou nice she was to them. And she\nwinds up taking it on the chin for being so nice to them. When I knou the whole time she was the\none who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafafia on the investigation\ntold OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did . . . was, as far as I could tell, [ ] completely pro\nprosecution.”\n\nBecause the emails in question were publicly disclosed without context and without other\ninformation shouing Villafafia’s consistent efforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a\npublic narrative developed that Villafafia colluded with defense counsel to benefit Epstein at the\nexpense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that\nnarrative to be inaccurate. The USAO’s and Villafafia’s interactions with the victims can be\ncriticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that any missteps\nVillafafia may have made in her interactions with victims or their atorneys were not made for the\npurpose of silencing victims. Rather, the evidence shous that Villafafia, in particular, cared deeply\nabout Epstein’s victims. Before the NPA was signed, she raised to her supervisors the issue of\nconsulting with victims, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted leters to notify victims\nidentified in the federal investigation of the pending state plea proceeding and inviting them to\nappear. The draft leters led defense counsel to argue to Department management that Villafafia\nand Sloman commited professional misconduct by “threaten[ing] to send a highly improper and\nunusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” of the listed victims. Given the full context of Villafafia’s\nconduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are\n\nl65\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023212.jpg": "The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of hou Acosta’s decision\nto create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal\ninvestigation led to unanticipated consequences benefiting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of\nthe core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the\nbeginning and from which he never wavered. Houever, the USAO failed to anticipate certain\nfactors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had\naresidence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender\nregistration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least l6 at the time of her\ninteractions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a l4-year old victim.\nThe victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a\nresidence, was l6; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2oo6 leter\nfrom defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Atorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had\nthoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration\nrequirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the\nUSAO.\n\nFinally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s atention\nbecause of a concern that the State Atorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense\ncounsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with\nthem at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with\nVillafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was\ndissatisfied with the State Atorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was\nsigned, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Atorney’s Office\nwas predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the\nSeptember l2, 2oo7 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with\nAcosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation\nof minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally\nspecified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to\nregister as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite\nthe assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned\nout—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.\nYet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been\nconsidered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about\nproceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful\nexecution.\n\nOPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by\nthis case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman\nand Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for\ntheir assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and\nrevised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether\nthe state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta\nfocused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state’s interest, as defined in\npart by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of\n\nl74\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023223.jpg": "managers required more effort than in other offices, where a line AUSA can more easily just stop\nby a supervisor’s office to discuss a case.”*”\n\nSecond, key personnel were absent at varying times. Menchel’s last day in the office was\nAugust 3, 2oo7, the day he sent to the defense his leter making the initial offer, and presumably\nin the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel would have been trying to wrap up his\noutstanding work. Yet, this was also the time when Acosta was deciding hou to resolve the mater.\nSimilarly, in the critical month of September, the NPA and plea negotiations intensified and the\nNPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having to consider multiple different options as key\nprovisions were continuously added or modified while Villafafia pressed to meet her late-\nSeptember deadline. Although Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this period, he\nwas at the same time transitioning not only to a new job but to one in Washington, D.C., and was\ntraveling between the two locations. Sloman was on vacation in the week preceding the signing,\nwhen many significant changes were made to the agreement, and he did not participate in drafting\nor reviewing the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation period for a\nsignificant case involving a unique resolution, no one involved had both a thorough understanding\nof the case and full ounership of the decisions that were being made. Villafafia certainly felt that\nduring the negotiations, she was only implementing decisions made by Acosta. Acosta, houever,\ntold OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did\nit do the .. . bullet points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy and\nMarie would have looked at this, and that this was . . . appropriate.”\n\nThe consequences flouing from the lack of ounership and effective communication can\nbe seen in the NPA itself. As demonstrated by the contemporaneous communications, the\nnegotiations were at times confusing as the parties considered multiple options and even revisited\nproposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafafia sought to keep to a deadline that would allou\nher to charge Epstein when she had planned to, if the parties did not reach agreement. In the end,\nAcosta accepted several terms with litle apparent discussion or consideration of the ramifications.\n\nThe USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” is a notable\nexample. As previously noted, the only writen discussion about the term that OPR found was\nVillafafia’s email to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to her\nco-counsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not believe the provision “hurts us,” and\nneither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although\nOPR did not find evidence shouing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended the scope of the\nprovision to protect anyone other than Epstein’s four assistants, the plain language of the provision\nprecluded the USAO from prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in his criminal conduct,\nwithin the limitations set by the overall agreement. This broad prosecution declination would\nlikely be unwise in most cases but in this case in particular, the USAO did not have a sufficient\ninvestigative basis from which it could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no\nother individuals who should be held accountable along with Epstein or that evidence might not\nbe developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third\noad In his OPR interview, Acosta commented that although Menchel’s office was on the same floor as Acosta’s,\nhe was in a different suite, which “affects <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span>.”\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23223", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.””* She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023262.jpg": "if you heve additional questlans which involve this mater, please contact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde fhe.file number located al the top of this leter, Please remnemder, your participation\nin the notification part of this program is voluntary.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\n\n33l The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases. For example, in March\n2oo8, one victim’s atorney informed Villafafia of his representation of a victim and requested that the government\nprovide him with photographs of the victim and information concerning the tail registration number for Epstein’s\nairplane.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nl28 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\ned Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023298.jpg": "Acosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].”\"”\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein.

LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS BY THE FBI WERE NOT FALSE STATEMENTS\n\nBUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the NPA was signed on September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia and the FBI separately\ncommunicated with numerous victims and victims’ atorneys, both in person and through leters.\nApart from three victims who likely were informed in October or November 2oo7 about a\nresolution ending the federal investigation, victims were not informed about the NPA or even more\ngenerally that the USAO had agreed to end its federal criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled\nguilty to state charges until after Epstein entered his guilty plea in June 2oo8. Despite the\ngovernment’s agreement on September 24, 2oo7, to end its federal investigation upon Epstein’s\ncompliance with the terms of the NPA, the FBI sent to victims in October 2oo7, January 2oo8, and\nMay 2oo8, leters stating that the case was “currently under investigation.” In its February 2l,\n2ol9 opinion in the CVRA case, the district court found those leters “misl[ed] the victims to\nbelieve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission for\nthe Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about\nwhich it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”*?\n\nIn the discussions throughout this section, OPR examines the government’s course of\nconduct with victims after the NPA was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR did\nnot find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted with the intent to\nsilence victims. Nonetheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s\ninteractions with victims, OPR concludes that the government’s inconsistent messages concerning\nthe federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government.\n\nIn this section, OPR examines and discusses leters sent to victims by the FBI that were the\nsubject of the district court’s findings. OPR found no evidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia\nwas aware of the content of the leters until the USAO received them from the FBI for production\nfor the CVRA litigation. OPR determined that the January lo, 2oo8 and May 3o, 2oo8 leters that\nthe district court determined to be misleading, as well as the October l2, 2oo7 leter OPR located\nduring its investigation, were “standard form leter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As\nnoted previously in this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents continued\nto conduct their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such a\n4o8 Villafafia told OPR that she recalled speaking to several victims along with FBI agents before the NPA was\nsigned and “ask[ing] them hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” FBI interview reports indicate that Villafafia\nwas present with FBI agents for some of the interviews occurring well in advance of the NPA negotiations. See 2oo5\nGuidelines, Art. IV, § B.2.c (l) (consultations may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying\nonly nonsensitive data and public information). Houever, Villafafia did not meet with all of the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation, including the CVRA litigation petitioners, and the government conceded during the CVRA\nlitigation that it entered into the NPA without conferring with the petitioners.

ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S\nDISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE\nCOURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS\nSTANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY\nFAILING TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS IDENTIFIED IN THE FEDERAL\nINVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA HEARING\nAs set forth in the factual discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it became\n\nclear that the defense team disagreed with, and strongly objected to, the government’s plan to\n\ninform victims of their ability to recover monetary damages from Epstein, under the l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255 provision of the NPA, and about Epstein’s state court plea hearing. The USAO initially\n\ntook the position that it was obligated to, and intended to, inform victims of both the NPA,\n\nincluding the § 2255 provision, and Epstein’s change of plea hearing and sentencing, so that\nvictims who wanted to atend could do so.\n\nIn November and December 2oo7, Epstein’s atorneys challenged the USAO’s position\nregarding victim notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning victim\nnotifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding into state actions, Acosta elected\nto defer to state authorities the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing\npursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights requirements. Acosta also determined that the USAO\nwould notify victims about their eligibility to obtain monetary damages from Epstein under § 2255,\na decision that was implemented by leters sent to victims after Epstein entered his state pleas.\nThis decision, which postponed notification of the NPA until after Epstein entered his guilty pleas,\nwas based, at least in part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to\npreserving the victims’ credibility and is discussed further in Section V, belou.\n\nIn this section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer to the state the responsibility for\nnotifying victims of Epstein’s plea hearing and sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA\nnor the VRRA required the government to notify victims of the state proceeding and therefore\nAcosta did not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to the discretion of the State\nAtorney whether to notify victims of Epstein’s state guilty pleas and sentencing. Houever, OPR\nalso concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because by failing to ensure that the state\nintended to and would notify victims of the federal investigation, he failed to treat victims\nforthrightly and with the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through counsel, Acosta\n“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard\n“never before expected of any U.S. Atorney.” OPR addresses Acosta’s criticisms in the\ndiscussion belou.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Atorney’s Discretion Whether to\n\nNotify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any\nClear or Unambiguous Standard\n\nIn November 2oo7, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct\nconcerning her interactions with the victims by preparing a writen notice to victims informing\nthem of the resolution of the federal case and of their eligibility for monetary damages, and inviting\nthem to appear at the state plea hearing. Villafafia and Sloman exchanged edits of the draft leter\nand, at Sloman’s instruction, she provided the draft to defense atorney Lefkouitz, who, in turn,\n\n265\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023313.jpg": "the federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘2S As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023316.jpg": "previously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\nNevertheless, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\nih In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4. l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nreinstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission”).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023317.jpg": "and they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).“44 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n48 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. lV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023318.jpg": "intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with\nvictims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°\nVI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND\n\nWITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS\n\nWITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE\n\nFEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nAlthough OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects commited professional\nmisconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in\ninteractions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of\naction. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,\nparticularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully atempted to\njoin in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the mater is\nthat the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s atorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It\nis unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after\nMenchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim\nnotification leters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the\nrequirements of the CVRA or the 2oo5 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was\nsigned. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2oo5 Guidelines, that\nDepartment employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime\nendure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by\nthe Department.\n\nWild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar\nto and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and\nthat demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced\na series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the\ncase agents. Wild received Villafafia’s leter in June 2oo7 stating inaccurately that she was a\nfederal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2oo7 but was\nnot told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2oo7 signing of\nthe NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,\non January lo, 2oo8, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights leter indicating that the case was under\ninvestigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was\ncharged. On January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS atorney and\nthe FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention\nthe NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2oo8, when\nEdwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under\ninvestigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8 state court plea,\n“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s atorney during the time period\nbetween the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2oo8, Sloman received a telephone call\nfrom his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal\ngovernment could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest\nallegations due to his prior business relations with the atorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.\nBecause Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the atorney.\n\n28o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023319.jpg": "Villafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the\nstate pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and\nlearned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had\nconcluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge\npermited it in August 2oo8 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of\ninteractions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and\nbelieving she had been misled.\n\nOPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,\nMenchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the\nNPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion\nof CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knouing that victim consultation\nwas not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to\nthe point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to\nconsult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the\nNPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address\nthe issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her oun concern about creating possible\nimpeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.\n\nNonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and\nafter the signing of the NPA, would have been the beter practice. Before the NPA was signed,\nvictims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was\ncontemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being\nconsidered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share\ntheir views of hou the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to\nproceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and\nconcerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the\nprocess. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or\nconsidered before the NPA was signed.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the\nmajority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.\nAlthough the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that\nEpstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA\nwas divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider hou the\ndesire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of\nthe openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed\nshe had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to\navoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have\ncarefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did\nthey revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or\nspoke to Edwards or other atorneys representing victims.*“° Furthermore, more atention needed\n446 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permited impeachment of the victims concerning one\nprovision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. ll(f) (“The\nadmissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of\nEvidence 4lo.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining\nmonetary damages through either a civil suit or through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 (if Epstein were convicted after a trial),\n\n28l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023320.jpg": "to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the impression that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\nca In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023321.jpg": "CONCLUSION\n\nIn November 2ol8, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about\nstate and federal criminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that\nJeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States\nand foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm\nBeach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2oo7, the U.S. Atorney for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that\npermited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by\npleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s\nco-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to\ninvestigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO\nimproperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by\nnegotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations\nstemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and\nlaw enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2oo8, a victim, later joined\nby a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition\nfor enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2ol9, the district court found that the\ngovernment violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the\nNPA. The court also found that leters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,\ndescribing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.\n\nDuring the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands\nof records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records\nincluded emails, leters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed\nmaterials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,\ngrand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available\ninformation, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media\nreports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted\nmore than 6o interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI\nadministrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and atorneys; current and former\nDepartment atorneys and senior managers; and the former State Atorney and Assistant State\nAtorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received writen\ninformation from several victims and atorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts\nwith the USAO and federal law enforcement.\n\nOPR identified the follouing five former USAO atorneys as subjects of its investigation\nbased on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case\nthrough the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Atorney\nR. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Mathew I. Menchel, Andrew C.\nLourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submited writen responses detailing their\ninvolvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and\ndecisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of\nall five subjects. The subjects also submited comments on OPR’s draft report.\n\n283\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023323.jpg": "principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not\nintentionally or recklessly violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA by entering into\nthe NPA without consulting with victims, because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation\nwithout a federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department\ndid not interpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the\nfederal courts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before\ncriminal charges were brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation\nwas for the purpose of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series\nof government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of\nthe government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is\ncontradictory to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims\nof a crime endure.\n\nOPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to\ncertain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and that\nfailed to inform them of the NPA. The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\n285\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23323", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023324.jpg": "OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes\nthat the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the\nDepartment.\n\n286\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23324", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023427.jpg": "telephone call, Epstein told Individual l that the press had goten crazy, and they discussed personal things\nsuch as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated. According to the representations by Individual l’s\ncounsel, Epstein told Individual l, “They are trying to keep me safe,” and that his case would take a litle\nlonger than he originally thought. He told Individual l he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be\nable to call her again for another month.\nSenior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had\npreviously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that\nalloued him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG\nthat Epstein was issued the necessary documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate l was his\ncellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l also advised the OIG about an <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> that he had with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the atorney. According\nto Senior Officer Specialist l, Epstein’s atorney asked him about geting Epstein the necessary\ndocumentation to make calls. Senior Officer Specialist l said he then verified that Epstein was able to make\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. When Senior Officer Specialist l asked Epstein why he had said\nhe was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.” Senior\nOfficer Specialist l said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s atorney, the atorney asked hou\nEpstein could get an unmonitored call. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein’s atorney that decision had to\nbe made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.\nNoel told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a\ntelephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shouer area within the SHU where he was afforded a\ntelephone call. The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside\nof the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and\ntherefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU\nand did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knouledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,\nthe call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately l5 to 2o minutes later, while Epstein\nwas still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s\ntime was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call\nlasted for 2o minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also\npresent in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,\nleft Epstein alone in the shouer, and went to use the bathroom on lo South. Noel said that upon her\nreturn, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during\nthe time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation. The Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by\nthe actions of another inmate. The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or\nEpstein in the shouer area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knouledge or information\nregarding a phone call made by Epstein that night.\nThe Northeast Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York\nofficial, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and\nthe call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created. The Northeast Regional\nDirector said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t knou\n\n6o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23427", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024912.jpg": "Page 435\n\nEpstein, Jeffrey Edward, Reg.

Houever, if dosage is increased, side effects will be more likely.\ne Side effects of Xanax may include:\nDecreased libido, drousiness, fatigue, impaired coordination, memory impairment,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\n@ Side effects of Xanax XR may include:\nConstipation, decreased libido, depression, drousiness, fatigue, impaired\ncoordination, memory problems, mental impairment, nausea, sedation, sleepiness,\nspeech difficulties, weight changes\ne Side effects due to a rapid decrease in dose or abrupt withdrawal from Xanax or\nXanax XR:\nAnxiety, blurred vision, decreased concentration, decreased mental clarity,\ndepression, diarrhea, headache, heightened awareness of noise or bright lights, hot\nflushes, impaired sense of smell, insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of reality, muscle\ncramps, nervousness, rapid breathing, seizures, tingling sensation, tremor, twitching,\nweight loss\nWhy should Xanax not be prescribed?\nIf you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,\nyou should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or\nNizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.\nDo not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrou-angle\nglaucoma.\nAnxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.\nDiscuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.\nSpecial warnings about Xanax\nXanax may cause you to become drousy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating\ndangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental\nalertness is not recommended.\nIf you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than\nfor anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long\nintervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor\nsupervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.\nAs with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage\nsuicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria knoun as mania. If you notice any new or unusual\n| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.\n|\n| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,\nalcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.\no7/26/l7 Page 43 of 95 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nhtp://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/rxdrugprofiles/drugs/xanl49l.shtml 7/l9/2oo6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32233", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032234.jpg": "Xanax, Alprazolam, side effects, drug interactions, overdose, dosage Page 3 of 6\ndl\nPossible food and drug interactions when taking Xanax\nXanax may intensify the effect of alcohol.

There is an increased\nrisk of respiratory problems and muscular weakness in your baby. Infants may also\nexperience withdrawal symptoms. Xanax may appear in breast milk and could affect a nursing\ninfant. If Xanax is essential to your health, your doctor may advise you to stop breastfeeding\nuntil your treatment with Xanax is finished.\nRecommended dosage for Xanax\nADULTS\nAnxiety disorder\nThe usual starting dose of Xanax is o.25 to o.5 milligram taken 3 times a day.

By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about <span class=\"highlight\">interaction</span> networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects. He has\ndonated $5oo,ooo to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where\nI have worked as Head of Theoretical Biology from l998 until 2oo3. In\n2oo3, Jeffrey donated $6,5oo,ooo to Harvard University, where I work as\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and Professor of\nMathematics and Biology. Both donations were meant to support my\nbasic research work without any strings atached.\nlo\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323o"};
