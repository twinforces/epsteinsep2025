In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in <span class=\"highlight\">Switzerland</span> but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v. Salvagno, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d ll5, ll9 (N.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (denying Government\nmotion to remand after trial where court found defendant not likely to flee); United States v. Chen,\n82o F.

Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in <span class=\"highlight\">Switzerland</span>, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

June 28, 2oo4) (seting conditions of bail where defendant\narrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the\nGovernment—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s\nfinancial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”). And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.
