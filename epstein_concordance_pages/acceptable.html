Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court schedule an\narraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in the above referenced case. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe defendant was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire on the charges contained in the above-\ncaptioned Indictment and presented before a United States Magistrate Judge in the District of New\nHampshire. At that appearance, the defendant waived her right to an identity hearing, consented\nto detention without prejudice to making a later application for bail, and consented to her transfer\nto the Southern District of New York.\n\nWhile the Government has no control over the timing of the defendant’s transport, the\nGovernment understands from the United States Marshals Service (“USMS”) that the USMS is\nacting expeditiously to transport the defendant into this District. In particular, the Government\nunderstands that the USMS expects that the defendant will arrive in this District early this week,\nwell within the ten days contemplated by the Speedy Trial Act for transfer of a defendant from\nanother district. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(l)(F).\n\nThe Government has consulted with defense counsel, Christian Everdell, Esq., who has\nrequested that the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this mater take place on July\nlo, 2o2o. In advance of that proceeding, the parties jointly request that the defense be permited\nto file a writen bail application to the Court by 3:oo p.m. on July 9, 2o2o, and that the Government\nbe permited to file a writen reply by l2:oo p.m. on July lo, 2o2o. If that schedule is <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span>\nto the Court, the parties respectfully request that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial\nappearance, and bail hearing in this mater for the afternoon of July lo, 2o2o.\n\nAdditionally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the\nSpeedy Trial Act between the defendant’s arrest on July 2, 2o2o and the date of the arraignment,\ninitial appearance, and bail hearing before Your Honor.

Testimony regarding the defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage\nMinor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in the context of massages establishes that the\ndefendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls and knew that Epstein used massage to\ninitiate sexual contact with minor girls. Similarly, testimony regarding the defendant’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3, including hou the defendant befriended Minor Victim-3 and then\nencouraged her to engage in sex acts with Epstein, establishes that the defendant intended for\nminor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein when she befriended them, invited them to travel,\nand arranged for their travel. Finally, the details of hou the defendant interacted with Minor\nVictim-3 demonstrates that the defendant had a specific modus operandi when grooming minor\ngirls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. As with Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2, the\ndefendant asked minor girls details about their lives, normalized sexual topics and activity, and\nused her presence as an adult woman to convince minor girls that the sexual activity Epstein\ninitiated was normal and <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span>. “The similarity sufficient to admit evidence of past acts to\nestablish a recurring modus operandi need not be complete; it is enough that the characteristics\nrelied upon are sufficiently idiosyncratic to permit a fair inference of a patern’s existence.” United\n6° Such evidence is particularly probative when it seems apparent from defense filings that the\ndefendant plans to argue that even if she were somehou involved in transporting or traveling with\nminors, she had no knouledge or intent that they engage in sexual conduct with Epstein.\n\nl67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 239\n4o3.”); United States v.

The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count One or Count Three as Multiplicitous Is\n\nPremature\n\nThe defendant moves to dismiss Counts One or Three on the ground that they are\nmultiplicitous. (Def.

Guzman, 337 F.\nSupp. l4o, l43 (S.D.N.Y. l972); see also Taylor, 4l9 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury\nselection system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 38o U.S. 2o2, 2o9\n(l965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute\ndisparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,\ne.g., Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.\nRamnath, l3l F.3d l32, l32 (2d Cir. l997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for\nHispanics); see also Barlou, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting\nclaims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!\n\nProperly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range\ndeemed <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is\nthe White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of ll.2o% Black or African-American persons\nand l2.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “community population” is the\njury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,\nwhich was comprised of l2.45% Black or African-American persons and l4.l2% Hispanic or\nLatino persons in 2ol8. (Ud. at § l9). This yields an “absolute disparity” of l.25% for Black or\nAfrican-American persons and l.l5% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity\ndoes not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.\n| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black\nor African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the\nsecond prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d l24o (2d Cir. l995). The unique facts of Jackman make\nit readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was\nmostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities\nin the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black population and 68.o9%\nof the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at l242-44. This resulted in a venire\ncomprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at\nl244.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.

Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process.

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 276 Filed o5/ll/2l Page l of 4\n2l2-243-lloo © Main 33 West l9th Street - 4th Floor\n9l7-3o6-6666 ° Cell New York, New York looll\n888-587-4737 ° Fax bc@sternheimlaw.com\n\nMay lo, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nWe write in response to the government’s May lo, 2o2l leter to the Court regarding the\ntrial start date. This Court ordered that the parties meet and confer regarding a trial start date and\nto \"agree to the earliest possible trial date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in\norder to facilitate an early fall trial start date.\" (Dkt. 266 at 3). Defense counsel atempted to\nconfer with the government in good faith to find a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> date. We sent several\nemails to counsel stating our reliance on our April 22d submission (Dkt. 246) where we specified\nour conflicts and the justification for our request. By contrast, and despite our requests for\nclarification, the government failed to provide any details to justify its request to delay the trial\nstart to November 29, 2o2l. Instead, the government filed a lengthy submission to the Court,\ncomplete with case law citations, at 8:l2 p.m., a few hours before the deadline for the “joint\nleter.” Moreover, the government also audaciously seeks by way of their joint leter regarding\nthe trial date to re-litigate the schedule this Court has already crafted after hearing from the\nparties both on submissions and in person, without even the courtesy of a motion for\nreconsideration on that schedule.\n\nFor the reasons previously detailed in our April 22d leter to the Court, defense counsel’s\nearliest possible — and preferred — trial start date is November 8\". As the Court is aware, Judge\nFurman moved my October 4\" trial to March, clearing the way for this trial to start on November\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 82 of 349\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo3 of 349\n\nG.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\n\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” °8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October ll, 2oo7, Sloman exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz about the text of a proposed addendum.\nB. October l2, 2oo7: Acosta and Defense Atorney Lefkouitz Meet for Breakfast\nOn the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkouitz, Acosta exchanged\nemails with Lefkouitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the follouing day, on October l2, 2oo7, at\na Marriot hotel in West Palm Beach. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta was previously\nscheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October ll and to speak at the Palm\nBeach County Bench Bar conference the follouing midday, and that he stayed overnight at the\nMarriot.\nlB Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury maters.\nl8 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.\n89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004534.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 237 of 349\nfor [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case\nagents removed from the case.\n\nBoth the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia\nthe concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of\na breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for\nadvice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°* In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\nao The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4534\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page9ofl7\npersistence” and “confirmation bias” are at work. Belief persistence occurs when an opinion\nformed is resistant to change even when proven wrong. Confirmation bias occurs when an\nindividual forms an opinion early in the decision-making process and then evaluates new\ninformation in a way that supports the earlier decision.' The jury questionnaire is the first\nopportunity jurors have to tell the lawyers and the Court what they are thinking and, more\nimportantly, what influenced them to think that way.\n\nGiven the likelihood intense media scrutiny of this trial, it is critical to use both a robust\nwriten jury questionnaire and individual sequestered voir dire to inquire about the extent to\nwhich each potential juror has been exposed to pretrial publicity and to what extent each juror\nhas formed an opinion of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein\n\nBecause there is always the fear that a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the entire\njury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity, a jury\nquestionnaire and individual voir dire in a case such as this is particularly warranted. If the Court\nwere to engage in public questioning of the venire panel en masse, answers could infect the\nentire panel. Alternatively, concerns about a panel member’s unanticipated answer may render\nthe questions too carefully worded to uncover the problem. Further, questions asked pose privacy\nconcerns that would require constant side bars. A questionnaire can solve some, but not all, of\nthese issues.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire would encourage jurors to answer questions more\ncompletely and more honestly because the jurors would not be influenced by (or influence) the\nanswers given by fellou jurors or fear embarrassment in giving an honest response.

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel4ofl7\nfor the court's evaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of\nimpartiality is insufficient [to test that impartiality]”) (citation omited).\n\nBecause it is extremely likely that prospective jurors have been exposed to potentially\nprejudicial pretrial publicity, specific, individual voir dire is required. Davis, 583 F.2d at l96-97.\nTo increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to\naccomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure\nthat a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to\nindividually examine prospective jurors.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety\nof benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure\non jurors to provide socially desirable or <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> answers in a group seting, reduces\nconformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being\ninfluenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury\nor be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,\nencourages candor, and promotes honesty.\n\nFurthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability\nto uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position\nheightening their reluctance to be candid. Atorney-conducted questioning bridges the status gap\nbetween the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.\nResearch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth\natorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater\n3 See, e.g., Moran, Cutler & Loftus.

Based on her experience as a clinician, Dr.\nRocchio will testify that young children in particular often feel more comfortable in the presence\nof a woman.\n\nThe defendant objects to this testimony on the grounds that it concerns a lay mater “which\na jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.” (Def.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005953.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nthe explanation for delayed or non-disclosure (Kogan, generalizable to all rape victims, because the percentage\n2oo4; Smith et al., 2ooo).

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006878.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 45\nPredictors of delayed disclosure of rape\n\nthe explanation for delayed or non-disclosure (Kogan, generalizable to all rape victims, because the percentage\n2oo4; Smith et al., 2ooo).

The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.\nRobertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-\nconsuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and\nmaking the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference\nbetween a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s atorneys also need unobstructed\naccess to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial.

In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.\nRobertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of\ninformation follouing the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o22l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021122.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page/5 of ll3\n\nThe Government argued that there is no Ex Post Facto violation in applying\n§ 3283 retroactively to Appellant’s pre-April 3o, 2oo3 conduct. We agree. See\nStogner, 539 U.S. at 632. But the Government’s reliance on Ex Post Facto\nprinciples is misdirection. As Richardson, Gentile, and Schneider illustrate, the Ex\nPost Facto Clause is not the final word on whether a statute is impermissibly\nretroactive. Indeed, the entire premise of Landgraf is that certain statutes must be\npresumed (absent a clear statement from Congress) to apply only prospectively,\neven though retroactive application would be entirely constitutional:\n\nBut while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil\n\nlegislation are nou modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate\n\ndefault rule. Because it accords with widely held intuitions about\n\nhou statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity\n\nwill generally coincide with legislative and public\n\nexpectations.

Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a civil\ncase. Non-criminal statutes, like criminal statutes, can be unconstitutionally\nretroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clauses), but the constitutional\nstandard is different from the Landgraf test. See E. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n498 (l998). Conversely, some criminal statutes are presumed not to apply\nretroactively even though doing so would be perfectly constitutional.\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll22\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021255.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8l 3536o38, Page83 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\n\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements.

Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl.

You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021277.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo3 3536o38, Pagelo5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo3 of 348\neverything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafaia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. '”° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” ”! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nVt The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we... shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021288.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagell6 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll4 of 348\na proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!%°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process.

We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication\nto the [victims].

Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional\nResponsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if\nyou’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”°° In her 2ol7 CVRA\ndeclaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped\nnotifying victims about the NPA.\n\nB. October 2oo7: Defense Atorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications\n\nWhile the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about\nthe resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns\nabout what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA\nwas signed on September 24, 2oo7, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the\natorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.\nOn October 5, 2oo7, when defense atorney Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a leter responding to the\nUSAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone\nfrom your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and\nwould prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified\nindividuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkouitz folloued this communication with an October\nlo, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should\ncontact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”°°° Rather,\nLefkouitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication to the identified\nindividuals.”\n\nOn October 23, 2oo7, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:\n\nWe also have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome\nof the case and to advise them that an atorney will be contacting\nthem regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do\nthat, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected\natorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.\n\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent Acosta\na leter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 2o, 2oo7,\n2o8 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about\nvictim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein mater before the CVRA litigation was instituted\nin July 2oo8 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional\nResponsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional\nResponsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”\n\n3o6 Lefkouitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.\n2lo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023093.tif": "charges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of restitution, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023114.tif": "G. Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\n2. That’s not <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span>, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3. Try to work it out.\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what\nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he recognized,\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact\nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make\nit less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023115.tif": "everything, but I really do not think that Mr. Epstein is going to engage in serious negotiations\nuntil he sees the Indictment and shous up in mag [federal magistrate judge] court.” She suggested\ncharging Epstein on a federal conspiracy charge, and if he refused to plead to that offense,\nsuperseding with additional charges and going to trial. She complained that after seven weeks of\nnegotiations, “we are just spinning our wheels.” Her proposed email to Lefkouitz detailed all of\nthe objectionable provisions in his draft, and concluded, “If you or your client insists on these,\nthere can be no plea agreement.”\n\nH. Acosta Edits the Federal Plea Agreement, and Villafatia Sends a Final Version\n\nto the Defense\n\nThe next day, Thursday, September 2o, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Assistant State Atorney\nBelohlavek and informed her:\n\nOur deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and\narraignment in the federal system. At this time, things don’t look\npromising anyway, but I will keep you posted. In their latest draft,\nthey changed what they agreed to plead to in the state from\nsolicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to\nforcing adults into prostitution (a non-registrable offense). We will\nnot budge on this issue, so it is looking unlikely that we will reach a\nmutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> agreement. If that changes, I will let you knou.\n\nAcosta sent Lourie “[s]ome thoughts” about the USAO version of the proposed “hybrid”\nfederal plea agreement he had received from Lourie the evening before, commenting that “it seems\nvery straightforward” and “we are not changing our standard charging language” for the\ndefense. !*° Noting that the draft was prepared for his signature, Acosta told Lourie that he did not\ntypically sign plea agreements and “this should not be the first,” adding that the USAO “should\nonly go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement.” !*! Lourie forwarded the email\nto Villafafia with a transmital message simply reading, “I think Alex’s changes are all good ones.\nPlease try to incorporate his suggestions, change the signature block to your name and send as\nfinal to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villafafia that he believed the defense would want\nto go back to the initial offer of a state plea with a non-prosecution agreement. When Villafafia\nsent the revised plea agreement to Lefkouitz later that afternoon, she advised him that if the\ndefense wanted to return to the original offer of a state plea only, the draft NPA she had sent to\nhim on September l7, 2oo7, would control.\n\nl2o The USAO had standard federal plea agreement language, from which this “hybrid” plea agreement had\nsubstantially diverged.\n\nl The standard procedure was for documents such as plea agreements to be signed by an AUSA under the\nname of the U.S. Atorney. In his OPR interview, Acosta further explained that wanted to give “the trial team” an\nopportunity to voice any objections because “if it’s something they don’t feel comfortable with we .. . shouldn’t go\nforward with it.”\n\n77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023126.tif": "a proposal regarding the special master’s responsibilities, along with a draft leter to send to the\nspecial master explaining the procedure for selecting an atorney representative.\n\nLefkouitz objected to this proposal in a leter to Villafafia, pointing out that the NPA did\nnot provide for the appointment of a special master. More importantly, Lefkouitz used the\ndiscussion of the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the\nNPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on the atorney representative, Lefkouitz argued\nthat the atorney’s role should be viewed as limited to negotiating setlements and that the atorney\nwas precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf of victims who could not reach a negotiated\nsetlement with Epstein. Lefkouitz proposed:\n\n[T]he selected atorney should evaluate the claims of each identified\n\nindividual, negotiate a total fund amount with Mr. Epstein, then\n\ndistribute the monies based on the strength of each case. For those\n\nidentified individuals who elect not to setle with Mr. Epstein, they\n\nmay proceed on their oun, but by doing so, they would not be suing\n\nunder § 2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not\n\ncontinue to be represented by the selected atorney.\nLefkouitz also objected to Villafafia’s draft leter to the special master, asserting that it was\nessential for the defense to participate in crafting a “mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication” to the\nvictims. Going further, Lefkouitz claimed that any contact between the USAO and the victims\nabout the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkouitz\nadmonished the government not to contact the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the\ncase, including [the] appointment of the selected atorney and the setlement process.”\n\nVillafafia forwarded Lefkouitz’s leter to Sloman, complaining that the defense\ninterpretation of the § 2255 procedure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking, “Can I\nplease just indict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed Sloman, and then sent a follou-up\nleter, asking that Sloman “help resolve” the issue regarding the atorney representative’s role, and\narguing that Epstein had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay fees for the victims’\ncivil lawsuits in the event a setlement could not be reached. When Villafafia explained to Sloman\nher views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that you communicate your\nproposal back to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the more wedges they try to drive\nbetween us.” Villafafia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many of them over there, I am afraid we\nare geting triple-teamed.”!*°\n\nVillafafia sent Sanchez a leter regarding the roles of the special master and atorney\nrepresentative. The next day, October lo, 2oo7, Lefkouitz sent a six-page leter to Acosta, asa\n“follou up to our conversation yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafafia’s\nview of the process for victims to claim § 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkouitz reiterated the\ndefense position that the atorney representative’s role was meant to be limited to negotiating\nsetlements for the victims, rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkouitz claimed that a requirement\nl36 Villafafia also alerted Sloman that a newspaper was reporting that defense counsel was writing a leter to\nAcosta asking for reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender. Villafafia commented,\n“Tt appears they don’t understand that a signed contract is binding.”\n\n88\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023127.tif": "that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound\nethical problems,” in that the atorney representative would have an incentive to reject setlement\noffers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkouitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein\nhad waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to setle their\nclaims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are\nvictims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkouitz again argued that the USAO should\nnot discuss the setlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for\nsetlement under § 2255:\nMs. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak\nwith the [victims] regarding the setlement process. We do not think\nit is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor\nshould the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal\nagents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to\ninform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of\nthe atorney representative and the setlement process. Not only\nwould that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but\nMr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to\nthe [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential\nthat we participate in crafting a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">acceptable</span> communication\nto the [victims]. We further believe that communications between\nyour Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate\nRule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The\npouers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be\nutilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”\nLefkouitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:3o call\ntoday.” 8\nVillafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about\ncrafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an atorney representative\nand to articulate the representative’s duties.
