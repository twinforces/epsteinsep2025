Second, because the material is\nnot in the possession of the government it is not a “statement” falling within Rule l7(h).\n\n‘“‘Witness Statements” covered by Rule l7 are defined by Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(f):\n\n(l) a writen statement that the witness makes and signs, or otherwise adopts or\n\napproves;\n\n(2) a substantially verbatim, contemporaneously recorded recital of the witness's\n\noral statement that is contained in any recording or any <span class=\"highlight\">transcription</span> of a recording;\n\nor\n\n(3) the witness's statement to a grand jury, houever taken or recorded, or a\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">transcription</span> of such a statement.\nThe “statements” are those of a testifying witness in the possession of the party who did not “call\nthe witness,” produced upon request after the witness testifies at a qualifying event, such as a\npretrial hearing or trial.\n\nMaterials held by entities other than the United States generally fall outside the Jencks\nAct and are therefore not “witness statements.” United States v.

United States v. Marks, 8l6 F.2d l2o7, l2lo-ll (7th Cir. l987). As the Seventh\nCircuit has explained, this is particularly important in the context of documents likes FBI reports,\nthat are not necessarily verbatim <span class=\"highlight\">transcription</span> of the witness’s alleged statement:\n\nIf defense counsel had been reading from a transcript of a previous trial or\n\ndeposition, there would have been no justification for the district judge's procedure.\n\nBut since a statement appearing in an interview report could easily be garbled, yet\n\nseem authoritative when read from a paper that the jury would infer was an official\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009254.jpg": "Case F2o5cl-oo88o; PAEumBuctien en 65o Filed&2z/24/22 gePagee 32 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.
