As the Second Circuit itself\nnoted, although the co-conspirator clause at issue\nhere is “silent” as to whether it intended to preclude\nco-conspirator prosecution outside the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, it is not silent as to whether\nEpstein’s future prosecution is limited to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. Instead, “the NPA makes clear that\nif Epstein fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer\nface charges in that district.” (App.9, emphasis in\noriginal). The use of narrouing terms as to Epstein’s\nprotections, not but not as to co-conspirator protec-\ntions, demonstrates that the difference was inten-\ntional. See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts at l67 (“The whole of a\ncontract is to be taken together, so as to give effect\nto every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause\nhelping to interpret the other.”); Id. at l7o ((“[A]\nmaterial variation in terms suggests a variation in\nmeaning.”).

The language was hotly contested and\nsubject to much revision back and forth, including\nspecifically on the relevant language of the coconspira-\ntor clause. (App.95, lo8-l26). In one of the earlier\ndrafts, the government proposed language that the\nco-conspirator protection would be limited to the\nSouthern District of Florida. (App.ll7). Yet the final\ndraft eliminated the limitation to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida and referred only to the United\nStates. (App.l22-24). The OPR report found that gov-\nernment witnesses (who were the only witnesses OPR\nspoke to) believed the co-conspirator clause was in-\ntended to provide transactional immunity. (App.l28-\nl29).

The\nperjury counts likely implicate the performance and\ncredibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of\nwhom represent her in this case. The New York Rules\nof Professional Conduct generally forbid a lawyer from\nrepresenting a client in a proceeding in which the\nlawyer is likely also to be a witness. N.Y. R. Prof’l\nConduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action\nand the deposition may be important fact witnesses on\nthe perjury counts. Even if counsel were not required\nto testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell\nto choose between having her counsel testify on her\nbehalf on the perjury charges and having them assist\nher in defending the Mann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that witness\ntestimony offered by a party’s atorney presents\nserious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v.\nMetro. Life Ins.

Of course,\nif wishful thinking were the standard, the whole NPA\nwould have been throun out long ago. The government\nhas spent years lamenting that agreement, and\ninitiated a massive OPR investigation into its execution\nwhich resulted in OPR’s conclusion that the atorneys\nwho negotiated it on behalf of the government did\nmany things contrary to internal government policy\nand typical practice. (App.55) (district court order\nnoting OPR’s findings that the NPA was “unusual in\nmany respects, including its breadth, leniency, and\nsecrecy.”); see also, e.g., App. 99.\n\nThe entire co-conspirator provision itself (puting\naside the issue of the jurisdiction(s) in which it is\nenforceable) was, according to OPR, unusual for such\nan agreement (App. l25).

App.lo. Petitioner falls\nsquarely within the class of persons — “any potential\nco-conspirators of Epstein” — that the NPA expressly\nprotected. She is therefore an intended beneficiary\nof the agreement, and she has standing to enforce it.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo253", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000287.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l4 of l6\nthe alleged conduct at issue here do not apply retroactively to Mr. Epstein’s case (including a\nmaximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of lo years).

For one thing, Epstein has potent legal defenses to prosecution under l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the sex trafficking statute driving the pending indictment. We front and briefly\noutline one of those defenses for the limited purpose of seeking bail. We will amplify it later,\nalong with various other arguments, in full-bloun dismissal motions.\n\nSection l59l was passed as part of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2ooo\n(“TVPA”), Pub. L. No. lo6-386, ll4 Stat. l464 (October 28, 2ooo). In enacting the TVPA,\nCongress <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that human trafficking, particularly of women and children in the sex\nindustry, “is a modern form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery today.” 22\nU.S.C. § 7lol(b)(l); see also id. at § 7lol(b)(2), (4). “The TVPA criminalizes and atempts to\nprevent slavery, involuntary servitude, and human trafficking for commercial gain.” United\nStates v. Evans, 476 F.3d ll76, ll79 (llth Cir. 2oo7). Importantly, “the entire language and\ndesign of the statute as a whole indicates that it is meant to punish those who are the providers or\npimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.” Fierro v. Taylor, No. ll-CV8573, 2ol2 WL\nl3o4263o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2ol2) (quoting United States v. Bonestroo, No. ll-CR-4ool6,\n2ol2 WL l37o4, at *4 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2ol2)) (emphasis added). In Fierro, the district court\nfound § l59l inapplicable to consumers or purchasers of sex acts. Here, the principal conduct\nunderlying the indictment is Mr. Epstein’s payment of money for massages that purportedly\nescalated to alleged sex acts. Mr. Epstein’s conduct, houever, is akin to consumer or purchaser\nbehavior and should be outside the ambit of l8 U.S.C. § l59l. See Fierro, 2ol2 WL l3o4263o,\nat *4 (“[T]he TVPA is inapplicable to individual purchasers of sex from trafficking\nvictims...”).!°\n‘o While Fiero represents the law in this district, Mr. Epstein notes that there is a division of\nauthority on the scope of § l59l. See United States v. Jungers, 7o2 F.3d lo66, lo68 (8th Cir.\n2ol3). The defense respectfully submits that the Fiero court’s approach to this issue is more\npersuasive and more consistent with the Congressional purpose to target commercial sex\ntrafficking.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000335.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 7 of l4\nHonorable Richard M.

Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or.

The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000378.jpg": "SORA HEARING page l2\n| & l consensual intercourse with him and l7 is not registrable or |\n2 criminal under.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo747", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000767.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 2of5\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v.

LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong.

See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001165.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck 3 Ob 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll65", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001171.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck I Ob 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal.

But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the\ngovernment does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that\nshe suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein,\n425 F. Supp. 3d 3o6, 3l4-l5 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Even according to the indictment, Ms.\nMaxwell’s alleged participation in offenses involving minors ended in l997.

The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4).

Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\nrape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\nincorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The district court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v.

Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001826.jpg": "CaSesk 2o 64ooo3 3o2AUN ei ddlinemoAl2 Ae 2TH 2oP Rages df 4\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” United States v.

United States, 539 U.S. l66 (2oo3) (holding that an order\npermiting the forced administration of antipsychotic medication is immediately appealable), see a/so\nMidland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799 (listing the <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> exceptions). Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories. Instead, she appeals from a denial of her motion to\nmodify a protective order, which we have held does not fall within the collateral order exception. See\nMohawk Indus. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. loo, lo7-o8 (2oo9) (holding that pretrial discovery orders are not\nimmediately appealable absent a shouing that “delaying review until the entry of a final judgment\nwould imperil a substantial public interest or some particular value of a high order” (nternal\nquotation marks omited)); S.E.C. ». Rajaratnam, 622 F.3d l59, l68 (2d Cir. 2olo) (holding that the\nCourt lacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory “discovery orders allegedly adverse to a claim of\nprivilege or privacy”); United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23, 26 (2d Cir. l986) (holding that the Court\nlacks jurisdiction to review interlocutory protective orders governing “the right of a criminal\ndefendant to disclose information given to [her] in discovery”). We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v. DiStefano, 464 F.2d 845, 85o (2d Cir. l972). Here, Maxwell failed to\ndemonstrate that such exceptional circumstances exist and that the District Court usurped its pouer\nor abused its discretion. Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal. To secure the further\nrelief of formal consolidation, Maxwell “bear[s] the burden of shouing the commonality of factual\nand legal issues in different actions.” In re Repetitive Stress Injury Litig., ll F.3d 368, 373 (2d Cir. l993).\nHere, the parties, Judges, and legal issues presented in these appeals lack common identity.

The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the international conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or international law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page lo of 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E).

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB. The Strength of the Evidence\n\nFurther incentivizing the defendant to flee, the Government’s evidence remains strong. As\nthe Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> when analyzing this factor at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, the central evidence\nin the Government’s case will come from the detailed testimony of three different victims, who\nwill each independently describe hou the defendant groomed and enticed them to engage in sexual\nactivity with Jeffrey Epstein.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable. See United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (noting, among other things, that the Government’s case was “novel,”\nand presented an “untried theory of liability” and that the defendant not only waived his right to\nappeal extradition in Switzerland but that he traveled immediately to the United States for\narraignment, and that his country’s government commited to ensuring his appearance at trial);\nUnited States v.

See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 23 of 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

Joinder of Offenses\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part,\n(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a\ndefendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses\ncharged--whether felonies or misdemeanors or both--are of the same or\nsimilar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are\nconnected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\n\nRule 8(a) sets forth three different circumstances in which separate offenses may be\nproperly joined in the same indictment; namely, when the offenses: (l) “are of the same or\nsimilar character,” (2) “are based on the same act or transaction,” or (3) “are connected with or\nconstitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging\nseparate offenses in the same indictment and allouing them to be tried together “inevitably\ninvolves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in\ncircumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> prejudice that accrues to\nthe accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d lo37, lo42-43 (2d Cir.l988); see also United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. l98o) (purpose of Rule 8 is to promote “trial\nconvenience and economy of judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43o (2d Cir. l978) (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for\njoinder”).\n\nIn conducting a Rule 8(a) analysis, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish\n‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its oun facts.” United States v.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2285", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl2o Filed ol/25/2l Page 8 of l9\nBlakney, 94l F.2d ll4, ll6 (2d Cir. l99l) (quotations and citation omited). “‘Similar’ charges\ninclude those that are ‘somewhat alike,’ or those ‘having a general likeness’ to each\nother.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Werner, 62o F.2d at\n926). Offenses are “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of\nrelated transactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996). By contrast,\noffenses are not “connected” and joinder is inappropriate when “[c]ommission of one of the\noffenses neither depended upon nor necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of the\none act neither constituted nor depended upon proof of the other.” Halper, 59o F.2d at 429.\n\nSimilarly, offenses that are separated by time and location, and were allegedly commited\nunder different circumstances, are not sufficiently connected to warrant joinder. See United\nStates v. Martinez, Nos. S2 92 Cr. 839 (SWK), l993 WL 322768, at *8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l9,\nl993) (granting severance of firearm possession and narcotics conspiracy counts where firearm\nwas seized in different location over four months after narcotics conspiracy ended “under\ncircumstances having no bearing on either the alleged narcotics conspiracy, or any of\n[defendant’s] coconspirators”); United States v.

OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 22\nCarpenter v.

But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position.

Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 38\ndiscovery demonstrates that\nee ae\n[|\n\nAs the NPA reflects, Epstein’s objective in negotiating the NPA was to obtain a global\nresolution that would, among other things, provide maximum protection for any alleged co-\nconspirators, in significant part to minimize the likelihood that Epstein could be subpoenaed as a\npotential witness and have to testify under oath.

Because such agreements involve waivers of\n\nfundamental constitutional rights, prosecutors are held to meticulous standards of\n\nperformance.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotations omited). The court held that given the absence of\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing, “the record does not furnish a basis for a complete\nunderstanding of what happened in the course of the plea negotiations,” and that the defendant’s\nevidence was “sufficient in these circumstances” to require the district court to take such action.\nTd. at l9o.\n\nUnlike the agreement in Fe/dman, the NPA here contains no integration clause, and the\nco-conspirator immunity provision, on its face, bars prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-\nconspirators without limitation as to judicial district, time period of the underlying conduct, or\nthe statutory violations alleged. Moreover, unlike the defendant in Feldman, Ms. Maxwell had\nno role in the negotiation of the NPA, and thus a// of the information relevant to its construction\nis in the possession of third parties. Houever, we understand that Epstein sought the maximum\nprotection from prosecution possible for his potential co-conspirators and that Main Justice\nparticipated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted\nwith the USAO for this District in its investigation. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. This\ninformation could be confirmed through discovery.\n\nMedia reports regarding the November 2o2o OPR report further support Ms. Maxwell’s\nposition.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002661.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l3 of 25\nretroactivity provision.

The defense has conferred\nwith the government and proposed the same date—March l2, 2o2l—+to produce all Jencks Act\nmaterial for both testifying and non-testifying witnesses.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002753.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 6 of 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002828.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouReiehd FieebdR22e/?l Pafageor 26 2o\nsection challenges under both the Act and the sixth amendment, our discussion of the statutory\nchallenge also disposes of his constitutional claim.”). :\nIn addition to fair cross-section claims, a defendant may also assert other violations of the\nISSA if those violations constitute a “substantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. at :\n87o (cleaned up); Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *4. “Mere technical violations” of the ISSA,\nhouever, are not actionable.

As the Supreme Court has explained, “i]t was not\nintended by Rule l6 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule l7 to give a right of\ndiscovery in the broadest terms.” Bouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l);\nsee also United States v. Purin, 486 F.2d l363, l368 (2d Cir. l973) (“A subpoena duces tecum in\na criminal case is not intended as a means of discovery.”). Unlike the rules of civil procedure—\npermiting the issuance of subpoenas to seek production of documents or materials which, although\nthemselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize\nthe issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule l7. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F.\nSupp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. l995); United States v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. l38, l4l (S.D.N.Y. l959)\n(Rule l7(c) cannot be used “to obtain leads as to the existence of additional documentary evidence\nor to seek information relating to the defendant’s case. This type of discovery, permissible under\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has not been authorized for criminal trials.”).\n\nThe purpose of Rule l7(c) is to “expedite the trial by providing a time and place before\ntrial for the inspection of” specific materials that the parties intend to offer into evidence.

As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea\nagreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. l at 3o (citing\nUnited States v.

We have long <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that plea\nagreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the\nthird party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under\nfederal law is a separate question.\n\nThe defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.\n(Def. Mot. l at l5). Houever, it does not necessarily follou that a third party may enforce such a\npromise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea\nagreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party\nhas standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.\n94 Cr. ll9 (RPP), l998 WL ll395o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., the Second\nCircuit held that a new statute shortening the filing period for a civil claim applied retroactively.\nIn reaching that conclusion, the Court noted that “Landgraf and other cases countenance treating\nstatutes of limitations differently from statutory provisions that affect substantive rights,” because\nstatutes of limitations regulate secondary, and not primary conduct. Vernon, 49 F.3d. at 89o-9l.\nIn In re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., 39l F.3d 4ol (2d Cir. 2oo4), the Second Circuit\nheld that applying an extended statute of limitations retroactively created impermissible retroactive\neffects. Yet in that case, it was critical to the Court’s analysis that—unlike here—the statute\nrevived claims that were previously time-barred. /d. at 4lo (“In our view, the resurrection of\npreviously time-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect.”’).\n\nIn Weingarten, the Second Circuit considered, but did not ultimately reach, the issue of\nwhether Section 3283 applies retroactively.'® In discussing the second step of Landgraf, the Court\nobserved: “Courts have routinely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> a difference between revoking a vested statute of\nlimitations defense and extending a filing period for live claims.” /d. at 57 (collecting cases).\nMoreover, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, the Second Circuit explained why extending an\nactive criminal statute of limitations does not offend any concept of fairness:\n\nCertainly it is one thing to revive a prosecution already dead, and\nanother to give it a longer lease of life. The question turns upon hou\n‘© The First Circuit has similarly considered this issue in the context of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim and declined to reach the issue of whether Section 3283 applies retroactively.

Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution. Maxwell instead cites dictum by a single\njudge in a non-criminal case that, “[i]f [he] were judging on a clean slate,” he would read Landgraf\nto prohibit some retroactive application of statutes that, “while not the equivalent of criminal ex\npost facto, nevertheless would run afoul of’ Landgraf’s considerations, and that he “expect[ed]\nthat the Supreme Court’s future decisions” would confirm such a reading. Thom v. Ashcroft, 369\nF.3d l58, l63 n.6 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (Calabresi, J., “[s]peaking only for [him]self’). That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf. Only one case has applied\n\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2996", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l3o of 239\n\nThe defendant argues that Martindell “authorized her to give deposition testimony under\nthe shield of the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could ‘insinuate itself”\ninto the case and use her oun words against her.” (Def. Mot. ll at l5-l6). That is not the law,\nand the defendant cannot use the protective order to cloak her testimony. The Second Circuit has\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that because “i]t is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need[,]” “as a practical mater it is clear that the protections afforded\nby a Rule 26(c) order are not as extensive as those afforded by the fifth amendment, or by a\nstatutory grant of use immunity, and that a protective order therefore cannot be used to abridge a\nwitness’ fifth amendment rights.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (emphasis in original);\nsee id. at lo84 (‘Uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of a protective order will mean that no\ndeponent may always effectively rely on a protective order to secure his right against self-\nincrimination.””) (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)));\nDavis, 7o2 F.2d at 42l-22 (“Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted\nFifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence [ | from compellable production\nbefore the grand jury which subpoenaed it’).\n\n4. The Government Did Not Violate Maxwell’s Due Process Rights\n\nThe defendant also claims that the Government’s conduct “cannot be squared with\nelemental due process.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l4 (citing U.S. Const. amend. V)). This claim is meritless.\nBecause there was no Government misconduct—let alone the type of outrageous Government\n\nlo3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003070.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l36 of 239\n“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the\nbasic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”\nCaplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 49l U.S. 6l7, 633 (l989) (citations omited). “The\nright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity\nto defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none\nof Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.\n\nDismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted\nhere, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot\nshou that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,\nbecause there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence\nobtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the\nfacts—must be denied.\n\n5. The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na. Applicable Law\n\n“{T]he Supreme Court has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> three purposes for the supervisory pouers, ‘to\nimplement a remedy for violation of <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring\nthat a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy\n\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003071.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l37 of 239\ndesigned to deter illegal conduct.’” Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (quoting United States v.\nHastings, 46l U.S. 499, 5o5 (l983)). “Houever, while there are times when a district court may\nproperly find it absolutely necessary[, in order] to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice\nsystem, to suppress evidence under its inherent or supervisory authority, ‘the Supreme Court has\nexplained that a court’s inherent pouer to refuse to receive material evidence is a pouer that must\nbe sparingly exercised [only in cases of] manifestly improper conduct by federal officials.” United\nStates v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (alterations and emphasis in original) (internal\nquotations and citations omited).

Discussion\nBy asking the Court to exercise its inherent authority, the defendant apparently means to\nsuggest that the Court should grant the relief she seeks, even if she has failed to establish a violation\nof the Constitution or other governing law. The defendant fails to provide justification for the\nextraordinary remedy of suppression or to cite persuasive case law in favor of such an\nextraordinary use of the Court’s inherent authority.\nllo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 239\n\nThe law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority does not extend to suppressing\nevidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.\nat 737 (holding that “the supervisory pouer does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered\nlimitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976\n(2d Cir. 2ol4) (same); United States v.

The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that principle, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 4ol-o2 (“We can\nappreciate the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact\nthe integrity of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an\nadversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing\nevidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise\nits supervisory pouers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth\nAmendment right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot\nbe described as a <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> right.” (internal citations omited)).\n\n6.

The standard to demonstrate\nmaterial false statements and omissions in an agent’s affidavit is a “high one.” Rivera v. United\nStates, 928 F.2d 592, 6o4 (2d Cir. l99l). The intent prong of Franks is particularly demanding\nwith respect to omissions. “Franks protects against omissions that are designed to mislead, or that\nare made in reckless disregard of whether they would mislead.” Awadallah, 349 F.3d at 68\n(emphasis in original). After all, “‘[a]ll storytelling involves an element of selectivity,’ and it is\ntherefore not necessarily constitutionally significant that an affidavit ‘omit[s] facts which, in\nretrospect, seem significant.’” United States v.

The Court should reject those arguments and permit the jury to resolve these issues of fact.\nVI. Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed\n\nThe Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse\nminors, and with commiting perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are\nproperly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a\ncommon scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second\njury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a\nsecond time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by shouing substantial prejudice from the\njoinder.

SDNY Jury Plan Art. III.B, HI.C. This is perfectly consistent with\nthe JSSA, see 28 U.S.C. § l869(e), and with longstanding precedent, as Judge Hand has explained:\n\n[T]he district and circuit courts have had pouer since the first\n\nJudiciary Act of l789 to divide a district territorially in the interest\n\nof an impartial trial, of economy, and of lessening the burden of\n\natendance.

Furthermore, it would be impossible in\n\npractice to administer it, if it were a condition that that the divisions\n\nmade must be so homogeneous that they shoued an equal\n\npercentage of all possible groups. There are probably no districts in\n\nthe Union, which can be divided without disclosing in the sections\n\ndifferent racial, religious, political, social or economic percentages.\n\nTo demand that they shall not, would be a fantastic pedantry which\n\nwould serve no purpose and would put an end to the statute.\nUnited States v. Gotfried, l65 F.2d 36o, 364 (2d Cir. l948); accord Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24-25.\n\nThere is accordingly no constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s claimed\nentitlement to a grand jury drawn from the population of the same “division” in which the offense\noccurred and she assumes she will ultimately be tried. To the contrary, the Second Circuit has\nrejected a similar claim. In Bahna, a defendant in the Eastern District of New York was initially\nconvicted at a trial held at the Brooklyn courthouse; after that conviction was vacated, he was\nagain convicted, this time at a trial held at the Uniondale courthouse. 68 F.3d at 2o.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta told OPR, houever, that he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months.

Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\n\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\n2, That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3.

You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3278", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003318.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l42 of 348\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate.

(Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not.

Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.*”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3354", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3359", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**” By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3385", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003389.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3389", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- oooo347l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3486", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o6- Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 22\nthus did not decide the issue (and in which Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was\nnot discussed), and Nader, in which the court incorrectly excluded legislative history from its\nLandgraf analysis. If Landgraf is correctly applied, and legislative history is given its proper\nweight in the analysis, it is clear from Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision that it did\nnot intend the 2oo3 Amendment to be retroactive. Counts One through Four are therefore time-\nbarred.\n\n3. The government cannot prevail at step one.\n\nMeanwhile, the government’s claim that it should prevail at step one can be easily\ndispensed with. The government relies on the language in the 2oo3 Amendment that “[n]o\nstatute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution” of a child sexual offense “shall\npreclude” prosecution during the life of the victim. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3). While the\ngovernment argues that this language refers to the pre-amendment version of § 3283, the Second\nCircuit <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> in Weingarten that “there is a more natural interpretation of that phrase that\ndoes not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2oo3 version of\n§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is\ndifferent from the default five-year limitations period under federal law.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d\nat 55. See also Miller, 9ll F.3d at 644 (suggesting that “otherwise preclude” language “may\nrefer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations”); Nader, 425 F.\nSupp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to “merely ‘signal the drafter’s intention that the\nprovisions .. . override conflicting provisions of any other section,’” rather than the pre-\namendment version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 5o8 U.S. lo, l8\n(l993)).\n\nThis interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same “[n]o statute of\nlimitation[s] that would otherwise preclude” language in the l99o statute that originally created\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3664", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25 of 34\ncounsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the\nMann Act charges.\n\nThe Second Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that witness testimony offered by a party’s atorney\npresents serious risks to the fairness ofa trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d l73,\nl78 (2d Cir. 2oo9). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their oun credibility, jurors might\nperceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between\nargument and evidence might confuse the jury. /d. Disqualification of counsel also implicates\nMaxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kincade, No. l5-cr-ooo7l (JAD) (GWF), 2ol6 WL 6l549ol, at *6 (D. Nev.\nOct. 2l, 2ol6). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the atorneys who\nrepresented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with\nthe facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d\nlo64, lo7o—7l (2d Cir. l982).\n\nThe Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial\nparticipants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does\nnot overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and\nevidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, l4 F.3d at\n753-54; Gaudin, 5l5 U.S. at 5o9. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to\nboth sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far\nbeyond the narrouer issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at\nleast some of Maxwell’s concerns are overstated, there is litle question that the jury’s\nconsideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time\nand resources to provide the requisite context.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3699", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page6ofl6\nindividuals, and she offers details about the type of sex acts performed and where they took\nplace.” Ex.

Accordingly, “[t]hese unnecessary details shall be stricken.”\nId. The court then struck all Ms. Giuffre’s factual allegations relating to her alleged sexual\nactivities and her allegations of misconduct by non-parties. /d. at 5-6.

The district court found not only that the “lurid details” were unnecessary but also\nthat the entire joider motion was “entirely unnecessary.” /d. at 7.\n\nMs. Giuffre and her lawyers knew the motion with all its “lurid details” was unnecessary\nbecause, as the court pointed out, the motion itself <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that she would be able to\nparticipate as a fact witness to achieve the same result she sought as a party. See id. at 7-8; see\nalso id. at 8 (noting that in the motion, Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers said that “regardless of whether\nthis Court grants the .. . Motion, ‘they will call [her] as a witness at any trial’”’). The court\ndenied Giuffre’s joinder motion. /d. at lo. One of the non-parties Ms. Giuffre “named”\nrepeatedly in the joinder motion was Ms. Maxwell. Ex. M, at 3-6. According to the “lurid\ndetails” Ms. Giuffre included in the motion, Ms. Maxwell personally was involved in a “sexual\nabuse and sex trafficking scheme” created by Epstein:\n\n° Ms. Maxwell “approached” Giuffre in l999 when Giuffre was “fifteen years old” to\nrecruit her into the scheme. /d. at 3.\n& Ms. Maxwell was “one of the main women” Epstein used to “procure under-aged\ngirls for sexual activities.” Id.\n« Ms. Maxwell was a “primary co-conspirator’ with Epstein in his scheme.

Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the\nmotion is “premature,” focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell\nwere convicted on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell atendant to the\novercharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until\n“after the completion of trial” which will “ensure” a full factual record. Resp. at l72. The\ngovernment is wrong.\n\nThe Court can, and should, grant this Motion, direct the government to elect which of the\nconspiracy charges it will prosecute, and dismiss the other. The identical facts are plainly alleged\nin the superseding indictment (“Indictment”), and the government has presented no factual\ndistinction in its response. Accordingly, no additional record is necessary and very clear\nauthority exists supporting the relief requested by Ms. Maxwell, dismissal of one of the\nmultiplicitous counts. “District courts presented with what are <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> before or during trial\nto be multiplicitous indictments will avoid any problem by requiring the prosecution to elect\nbetween counts charged rather than by merging the counts at sentencing.” United States v.\nPolizzi, 257 F.R.D. 33, 36-37 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo9). The Court should order such an election and\ndismissal here.\n\nI. The Motion is Not Premature, and the Court has Discretion to Direct Election\nand Dismissal Pretrial\n\nThe government’s “prematurity” argument is misplaced. Pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l2(b)(3)(B)(i), a defendant is required to raise arguments based\non defects in the indictment, including “charging the same offense in more than one count\n(multiplicity),” by pretrial motion “if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3759", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2lo Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\ndefect by requiring the government to elect which of the conspiracy charges it will move forward\nwith and dismiss the remaining conspiracy charge.\n\nII. The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged\n\nConspiracies Are Distinct.\n\nTo guard against the “well <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> danger” that prosecutors can easily “draft\nindictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an\noverall conspiracy,” where a defendant “makes a non-frivolous shouing that two indictments in\nfact charge only one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to shou, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies.” United States v.\nLopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (citing United States v. DelVecchio, 8oo F.2d 2l, 22 (2d\nCir. l986)). As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell’s moving papers, application of the Korfant\nmultifactor test results in an identical overlap of alleged: participants, time, similarity of\noperation, overt acts, geography, objectives, and interdependence. Mot. at 2. The government has\nfailed to proffer any evidence to the contrary, and Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be deemed\nconfessed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, she requests that\nthe Court enter an order requiring the government to elect the conspiracy charge it intends to\nprosecute and dismiss the remaining count.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo376l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003782.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8of2o\n\nFirst, the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\n\n[t]here is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information\n\naddressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location information\n\ncasually collected by wireless carriers today. The Government thus is not asking\n\nfor a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant\n\nextension of it to a distinct category of information.\n\nId. at 22l9. Second, the Court concluded that in “in no meaningful sense” did Carpenter\nvoluntarily “assume the risk” of “turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical\nmovements.” /d. at 222o.\n\nThe same logic applies here. There is “world of difference between the limited types of\npersonal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive” and personal details\nabout Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller’s 9o,ooo pages of confidential material.\nThese details include, for example, information about Maxwell’s sexual partners, sexual habits,\nfinances, and much, much more.\n\nMoreover, “in no meaningful sense” did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with\nBoies Schiller. Giuffre sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the\nonly claim Giuffre ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing\nto do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide.\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for\nseverance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell Pre-Trial Mot.\nNos. 4 & 5.\n\nBut the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrou, but Boies\nSchiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and\nMaxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing Giuffre, which then compelled Maxwell, over\nobjection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal questions. None of it was\nvoluntary.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3782", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagell of 2o\n\nSecond, the government’s inevitable discovery doctrine is far too speculative. The\n“typical application” of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when “the government seeks to\ninvoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring\ninventory searches.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government’s “inevitability analysis in this\ncase,” houever, “is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by\nthird parties,” such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are “not acting at the behest of\nthe police.” /d. “Such an analysis is inherently speculative.” Jd.\n\nIn fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against\nMaxwell or Epstein’s estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going\nunsealing process in Giuffre v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein,\nDoe v. Indyke, No. 2o-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery,\nsaying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell.\n\nBy contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v.\nMaxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in\nmisleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to\nBoies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allouing the unsealing process to\nunfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it nou makes. This Court should not\ncondone such gamesmanship.!\n\nThird, the government’s inevitable discovery argument is far too broad. Even the\ngovernment admits that the vast majority of material it obtained from Boies Schiller is not on the\nGiuffre v. Maxwell docket and has not been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the\ngovernment’s response appears to concede that its inevitable discovery argument is limited to\n\n' As the government recognizes, Judge Preska <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> this possibility, but deferred to this\nCourt on the question since it is presiding over the criminal case.

West Virginia, 547 U.S. 867,\n87o (2oo6). With this definition in mind, the Government would view any evidence that the NPA\nwas intended to (l) bind other U.S. Atorneys in other districts; or (ll) cover Maxwell specifically,\nas “evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA” that it would be required to disclose.\n(See April l6, 2o2l Opinion, Dkt. No. 2o7, at 8, 3-7 (discussing the bases for Maxwell’s motion\nunder the NPA)). As set forth in more detail belou, the Government has not identified any such\nevidence in its possession.\n\nThe Government does not, houever, view any other materials that are simply re/ated to the\nNPA as materials it is required to disclose in this case, either under Rule l6 or Brady.\nNevertheless, and as the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, the defendant already has access to a large swath of\ninformation that the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR’’)\ncompiled as a result of their thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the\nnegotiation of the NPA, and the Government has not sought to, nor would it be obligated to, redo\nOPR’s work. (Dkt. No. 2o7, at 8 (noting the “extensive OPR report” and that “No record evidence\nsuggests that prosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing.”’).\nIn the interest of clarity, the Government sets forth belou a description of the materials it has\ncompiled and reviewed, and will continue to review, for potential Brady material in this case, while\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3956", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Pagel2ofl3\nThe Hon.

Motions\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the Court will need to resolve various discovery disputes\nrelating to the problems identified supra. In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to\nsupplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P l2 motions relating to\nthe second superseding indictment. After reviewing the “new” discovery, Ms. Maxwell\nanticipates that she will file motions in limine related to the government’s alleged FRE 4o4(b)\nevidence and the government’s proposed exhibits, FRE 7o2 challenges to purported expert\ntestimony, and motions concerning jury selection and change of venue. In addition, expert\ndisclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”\ndiscovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along\nwith the late disclosure of Brady material and failure to provide the discovery to Ms. Maxwell\nhave delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that\nwould normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings. Simply stated, Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel cannot perform all of the necessary tasks in the time remaining before July l2, 2o2l.\n\nII. Requested Relief\nIn United States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 23l (l985), Justice Blackmun, in a\nconcurring opinion joined by Justice Brennan, <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the need for a continuance when a\nsuperseding indictment adds significant changes.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3999", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page2of9\nPage 2\n\nThe Nixon test is enforced strictly. “The party requesting the subpoena must also shou\nthat the information sought is ‘not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise\nof due diligence,’ that ‘the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production,’ and\nthat ‘the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general “fishing expedition.”’”\nUnited States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, lo9 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 699-7oo),\nabrogated on other grounds as <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> by United States v. Chambers, 75l F.

Supp. 3d 237,\n254 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (internal quotation marks omited). Moreover, as the Court has explained,\nimpeachment material is not “relevant” within the meaning of Nixon “until after the witness\ntestifies.” (Order at 5). See Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“[g]enerally, the need for evidence to impeach\nwitnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of trial” (citations omited)). Finally,\nRule l7 by its terms prohibits subpoenas aimed at statements “of a witness or a prospective\nwitness.” See Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nAlthough the Government has not seen the proposed subpoena, the Government\nunderstands that Request 9 seeks the complete diary of Minor Victim-2, Request lo seeks a pair\nof boots given to Minor Victim-2, and Request ll seeks a series of photographs. Requests 9 and\nll should be denied. The Government is working to moot Request lo, so the Court should reserve\ndecision on that request until it can be denied as moot.\n\nA. Request 9\n\nThe Government understands that Request 9 calls for Minor Victim-2’s entire diary from\n\nher teenage years. This request is improper under Rule l7 in three respects.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 285 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 2l of 34\nmaters that were the subject of the Giuffre [defamation] Action,” and having been misled by\nAUSA | tesponse, Judge McMahon erroneously (though blamelessly) concluded that\n\n[nJothing in this record suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything\n\nto do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand jury to look into the\n\nmaters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. . .

By the government’s oun admission, Accuser-3 will not\ntestify, and the government cannot prove, that Accuser-3 Pe\neven if Accuser-3 testifies in accordance with the proffer, the government will be unable to\nestablish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity.“\n\nThe government argues that it “does not mater” whether Accuser-3 was an adult when\ninvited to travel (Opp. l62), because even evidence that she was invited to travel as an adult\nwould be “probative” of Ms. Maxwell’s “intent, in her initial interactions with [Accuser-3], to\nentice [Accuser-3] to travel and be transported for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.” Opp.\nl63.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Acosta told OPR, houever, that he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that Villafafia and Lourie needed “some\ndegree of discretion to negotiate”; that “in the give and take” of negotiations, they might propose\na concession; and he was comfortable with the concession as long as the charge to which Epstein\nultimately pled “captured the conduct” in an “appropriate” way.\n\nAlthough Epstein’s atorneys expressed interest in Epstein serving his time in a county\nfacility (rather than state prison), one of Epstein’s atorneys alternatively expressed interest in\nEpstein serving his time in a federal facility, and along with discussions about the possible state\nresolution, the USAO and Epstein’s counsel also discussed a possible federal plea with a sentence\nrunning concurrently to the sentence Epstein would receive on the already indicted state charge.\nLater that day, Villafafia sent Lefkouitz an email advising that she and Lourie had talked with\nAcosta and Sloman, and they were “all satisfied in principle with the agreement.”!” The next day,\nSeptember l3, 2oo7, Villafafia sent an email to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and two other supervisors,\nidentifying potential federal offenses that would yield a two-year sentence. Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months. And\n\nthese were calls that if I remember correctly, Jay Lefkouitz was\nlo8 Belohlavek, houever, told OPR that sexual offender registration “was a common occurrence” for enumerated\nstate crimes, but the state crime charged in the state indictment against Epstein was not one of them.\nlo9 The email does not indicate what the parties meant by “the agreement.”\n\n66\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo3 of 349\n\nG. Villafafia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges\n\nThat They “Try to Work It Out”\n\nIn the late afternoon of Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, Villafafia expressed her\nincreasing frustration to her supervisors. She emailed the defense redline version of the plea\nagreement to Lourie and the incoming West Palm Beach manager, identifying all of the provisions\nshe had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into\nthe agreement.” (Emphasis in original). Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie. Based on my oun conversations with him, his draft is\nout of left field. He claims to orally agree to our terms and then\nsends us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply tell\nhim that his counter offer is rejected and that we intend to move\nforward with our case.\n\nAcosta replied:\n\nWhy don’t we just call him. Tell him\nl. You agree, and then change things.\nDe That’s not acceptable, and is in bad faith. Stop it or we’ll\nindict.\n\n3. Try to work it out.\nIt seems that we are close, and it[’]s worth trying to overcome what\nhas to be painfully . . . annoying negotiating tactics.\n\nAcosta explained to OPR that he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>,\n[t]his negotiation was a pain, but if it was the right position, the fact\nthat you’ve got annoying counsel on the other side doesn’t it make\nit less of a right position. You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004440.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l43 of 349\nFlorida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta\n“<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release\nProgram” and pointed out that the December 6, 2oo7 draft victim notification leter sent to\nLefkouitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is\nalloued to participate in a work release program.”\n\nOn December 3, 2oo8, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent\nSloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work\nrelease program:\n\nIt appears that, since Day l, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have\n\nbeen scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the\n\nindictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would\n\nhave made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged\n\ncorrectly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with leting\n\nus believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when\n\nEpstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was\n\nnot registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that\n\nEpstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the\n\nStockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at\n\nthe jail....\n\nAs part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's\n\ndeputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is\n\npaying between $3ooo and $4loo per week for this service, despite\n\nthe work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff's Office (and\n\nthe Sheriff's Office itself) from having “any business transactions\n\nwith inmates . . . while they are in the custody or supervision of the\n\nSheriff... .”\nVillafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge\non the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriffs Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo444o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not.

Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004476.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l79 of 349\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4476", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l84 of 349\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting .. . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney ‘“‘an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW |hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo448l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004497.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2oo of 349\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.**? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4497", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff... .\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004511.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l4 of 349\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”?*?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 296 of 349\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4593", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

The Court\nagrees that, at the very least, the exception to the exclusionary rule for inevitable discovery\napplies to the documents that have since been unsealed and made public in the civil case.

The gravamen of this claim is that the\nGovernment misrepresented its prior contacts with BSF to Judge McMahon. Maxwell contends\nthat this misrepresentation violated her due process rights, or alternatively that the Court should\nexercise its inherent authority to suppress the evidence obtained through the subpoena as a\nsanction for governmental misconduct. She contends that even an inadvertent misstatement to a\ncourt requires suppression of evidence obtained as a result.

The court reasoned that the distance in time between\nthe prior acts and the incident involving Constand was “inversely proportional to the\nsimilarity of the other crimes or acts.” /d.

Luktisch, 68o A.2d 877 (Pa.

Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court\nexplained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their nearly identical similarities\nrenders the lapse of time unimportant.” /d. at lo9.\n\nTo be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must\nbe “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to\ndivert the jury’s atention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at\nloo (quoting Pa.R.E. 4o3 cmt).

The panel\nhighlighted the fact that the trial court provided the jury with cautionary instructions on the\nuse of the evidence, as well as that court’s decision to limit the number of prior bad acts\nwitnesses to five. These steps, in the Superior Court’s view, were sufficient to mitigate\nthe prejudicial impact of the evidence. /d.\n\nThe Superior Court dealt separately with Cosby’s Rule 4o4(b) challenge to the use\nof his deposition testimony regarding his provision of Qualudes to women in the past.\nThe court rejected Cosby’s “atempts to draw a hard distinction between Qualudes and\nBenadryl,” and noted that “the jury was free to disbelieve [Cosby’s] assertion that he only\nprovided [Constand] with Benadryl.” /d. at 42o. The court credited the Commonwealth’s\nargument that Cosby’s familiarity with Qualudes was suggestive of his mens rea,\ninasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances knoun to him for purposes of\ndetermining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated\nindecent assault—recklessness.” /d.

See Santobello v. New\nYork, 4o4 U.S. 257 (l97l).2’ Santobello holds that, “when a plea rests in any significant\ndegree on a promise or agreement by the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of\nthe inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” /d. at 262 (emphasis\nadded).\n\nThis Court has folloued suit with regard to prosecutorial inducements made during\nthe guilty plea process, insisting that such inducements comport with the due process\nguarantee of fundamental fairness. In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43.

Nevertheless, it is only sensible\nto read Santobello’s holding as resting upon due process principles because—as Justice\nDouglas noted in his concurring opinion—without a constitutional basis the Court would\nhave lacked jurisdiction over what was otherwise a state law mater.

The applicability of\ncontract law to aspects of the criminal law has been <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> by the Supreme Court of\nthe United States, see Pucket v. United States, 556 U.S. l29, l37 (2oo9), by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, see McKeever v. Warden SCI-Graterford,\n486 F.3d 8l, 86 (3d Cir. 2oo7), and by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Martinez, l47\nA.3d 5l7, 53l (Pa. 2ol6). In order to succeed on a claim of promissory estoppel, the\naggrieved party must prove that: (l) the promisor acted in a manner that he or she should\nhave reasonably expected to induce the other party into taking (or not taking) certain\naction; (2) the aggrieved party actually took such action; and (3) an injustice would result\nif the assurance that induced the action was not enforced.

This Court found that the\nnon-prosecution agreement was invalid, because the police did not have the authority to\nmake it. Only a prosecutor holds that pouer. /d.\n\nWe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that what befell the Stipetiches may have been “fundamentally\nunfair,” particularly if their discussions with the police produced additional evidence of\ncriminality, including possibly self-incriminating statements. /d. at l296. In dicta, we\nsuggested that the remedy might be to suppress the evidence or statements that were\nobtained after the police purported to bind the Commonwealth in a non-prosecution\nagreement. /d.\n\nThis remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the\nremedy statement was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the\ncircumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those\nthat occurred in the present case. In Stipetich, the agreement was formulated with\narresting officers, who lacked the authority to make the promise not to prosecute. Here,\nconversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Atorney of\nMontgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his\nauthority, and was objectively worthy of reasonable reliance. Finally, a one-size-fits-all\nremedy does not comport with the individualized due process inquiry that must be\nundertaken. As outlined above, a court must ascertain, contemplating the individual\ncircumstances of each case, the remedy that accords with the due process of law. In\nsome instances, suppression of evidence may be an adequate remedy; in others, only\nspecific enforcement will suffice.\n\nHere, only full enforcement of the decision not to prosecute can satisfy the\nfundamental demands of due process.

All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s\nreliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s\nremedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no\nremedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nouhere near where he\nwas before the due process violation took root.\n\nThere is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.\nHe must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be\nbarred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted\nhere, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it\nmight thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be\ngainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true\nthat no such interest, houever important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring\nthat the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution\ndoes not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.\nIV. Conclusion\nWe do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether\ncharges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at l295. We will not\nundermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> pouer to conduct criminal\nlitigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and\nwhen to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d.

This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5lo4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 53 of 6o\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present.

Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it\nwould be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory\nchallenges.\n\nA. The Atorneys Have More In-Depth Knouledge of the Case\nIt is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary\n\nto exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through atorney-conducted voir dire. The\natorneys have more in-depth knouledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.\nCleveland, l997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, l997). Important follou-up questions are more\nlikely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge\n“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges\nbased on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not\nknou the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened\nareas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>:\n\nA judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities\n\nand nuances as the trial atorneys entrusted with the preparation of\n\nthe case. The court does not knou the strength and weaknesses of\n\neach litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an\n\nopportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the\n\njuror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.\nLedee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2\nA.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (l976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating\nthat “voir dire may have litle meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”\n\nWhile Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide\n\ndiscretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have litle meaning if it is\n\nnot conducted at least in part by counsel.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her charitable works or evidence of her family history. Such\nevidence should be excluded as irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial.\n\nAs discussed above, the Federal Rules of Evidence preclude the use of good acts to draw\na propensity inference in favor of the defendant, just as they preclude the use of prior bad acts for\nthe same purpose. See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF. App’x 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (“The district court correctly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\nevidence of solitary confinement could be used for the improper purpose of provoking juror\nsympathy.”). Any atempt to encourage such sympathy is therefore an atempt at nullification,\nwhich is itself plainly improper. See, e.g., United States v.

For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the integrity of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... integrity of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3.

But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F.

Ms. Maxwell also\nrespectfully moves the Court to redact from the superseding indictment the perjury counts and\nany allegations that Ms. Maxwell made false statements to “conceal” her involvement in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s crimes. Ms. Maxwell requests this relief pursuant to the Court’s prior severance ruling\nand Federal Rule of Evidence 4o3. See 4/l6/2o2l Op. and Order (Dkt. 2o7) at 23-26; Fed. R.\nEvid. 4o3.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Court has already ruled that the perjury counts must be severed because trying the\n\nperjury counts with the other counts in the indictment would risk admiting evidence that would\nbe “unduly prejudicial” to Ms. Maxwell, would “compromise [Ms.] Maxwell’s right to the\ncounsel of her choice,” and would “risk an unfair trial.” 4/l6/2o2l Op. and Order (Dkt. 2o7) at\n23-24. In particular, the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that introducing evidence related to the perjury\ncharges would expose the jury to other acts of alleged sexual abuse that are not charged in the\nindictment, as well as evidence of an unrelated civil lawsuit by a separate accuser, that could\nsignificantly sway the jury’s verdict on the other counts in the indictment.\n\n[Trying the perjury counts with the other counts] would introduce\n\nunrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially\n\nexpose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.\n\nIn particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a\n\nwider swath of information regarding civil litigation against\n\nEpstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This\n\npresents a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence\n\nof the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered\n\nseparately, it would not do so.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page7ofil\n\nSecond, any evidence of alleged false statements, whether it is introduced as direct\nevidence of the perjury counts or as evidence of a purported effort to “conceal” the other crimes\ncharged in the superseding indictment, would substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell and would\njeopardize her right to a fair trial for the same reasons the Court identified in its severance ruling.\nAllouing the jury to consider evidence related to the perjury counts “would introduce unrelated\nallegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the jury to evidence that might\notherwise not be admissible . . . [and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation\nagainst Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24. This would present\n“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd.

Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 84\nestablished patern of victimization—atachment and coercion—experienced by victims of sexual\nabuse.\n\nThe defense would read Raymond to stand for the proposition that expert testimony is\nunreliable if it does not explain “what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her\nconclusions can be verified.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). For instance, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio\nfor opining that sexual abuse of minors occurs “frequently,” without specifying whether it occurs\n“half the time” or “two-thirds of the time.” (/d. at 7; see id. at 8 (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp.\n2d at l48-49)). That is not what is required by Daubert in the context of qualitative social science,\nand it is not what many courts have held in the context of precisely this form of testimony, as\nexplained above. To the extent Raymond stands for such a broad proposition, it is contrary to the\nlaw of this Circuit. See United States v. Joseph, 542 F.3d l3, 2l-22 (2d Cir. 2oo8), abrogated on\nother grounds as <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> by United States v.

First, the\ndefendant asserts that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are uncorroborated, and she “simply assumes her\n2 Even in Raymond, the Court left open the possibility that the Government could call the expert\nin rebutal to “counter a defense case that victim testimony in this case should not be believed\nbecause the victim delayed in reporting the abuse or did not report it consistently.” 7oo F.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book.

She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing.

This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997). Alternatively, the offender\nmay interact with the child on the child’s wavelength (van Dam, 2ool). Wilson (l999) found\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005975.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment.

On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves.

For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim.

(Ex. A at 4). This claim is itself unsupported by any evidence. It is also wrong. For\ninstance, an article cited by Dr. Dietz describes a literature review of sexual abuse involving\nteachers, which identified “factors that make a child vulnerable to educator sexual abuse, such as\nproblems at home with parents, lack of confidence, and participation in other risky behavior.” (See\nBennet & O’Donohue, “The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual\nAbuse 957, 964 (2ol4), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A; Ex A at 4 (citing the same)). Other scholars have\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “[g]rooming the child begins with recognizing a vulnerable child,” such as children\nwith “a poor relationship with their parents,” who “do not have many friends,” or who “have\nalready been victimized.” (Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children,” l2 J. Sexual Aggression\n287, 292 (2oo6), Dkt. No. 397 Ex. A (citations omited)). Dr. Rocchio’s clinical experience is\nsupported by the academic literature, in which perpetrators’ targeting of vulnerable victims is well\nestablished. Dr. Dietz must do more to shou the reliability of his view than simply call this\nliterature “clinical lore” and complain about the lack of data.\n\nFourth, Dr. Dietz states that “no authority . . . support[s] a theory of grooming-by-proxy.”\n(Ex.

Based on her testimony, the parties’\nsubmission and accompanying exhibits, the Court concludes that the core concept of grooming is\nwell-accepted in the relevant literature, even if experts continue to debate the details.\n\nThe Defense’s primary argument is that Dr. Rocchio’s method is unreliable because it is\nbased on her personal experience with the clients she has treated, that Dr. Rocchio did not verify\nwhether those clients were truthful, and that Dr. Rocchio has not and cannot identify an error\nrate.

Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF.

For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the integrity of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... integrity of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v.

Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579 (l993).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government\nretreats to a familiar tactic: The use of a “blind” expert to fill in the gaps, to explain away the\ninconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.\n\nThe foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”\nbehavior. But grooming is not a widely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> or highly predictable and verifiable\nphenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred\nor is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to\nvalidate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims\nnot for her oun benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nRocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her\npersonal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually\nabused and who Rocchio assumes are telling the truth. There are no studies or data to back up\nher conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or\nreproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert\n' Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23\nJ.

Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.\n\nNone of Rocchio’s opinions about grooming will “assist the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 59l (“‘Fit’ is not always obvious,\nand scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated\npurposes.”’). As in Raymond and United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does not propose\nto have [Rocchio] relate [her] general opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts\nin this case.” Gonyer, 2ol2 WL 3o43o2o, at *3.

But\neven Rocchio does not contend that “grooming” is a “widely and highly predictable and\nverifiable phenomena.” See Ex. l.\n\nStill, without any elucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception of grooming and\nthen leave it to “a lay jury without guidance . . . to apply [her] analyses reliably to the facts of a\ncase in determining guilt.” Raymond, 7oo F.

Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l89 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The Second\nCircuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the disclosure and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6687", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 84\nestablished patern of victimization—atachment and coercion—experienced by victims of sexual\nabuse.\n\nThe defense would read Raymond to stand for the proposition that expert testimony is\nunreliable if it does not explain “what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her\nconclusions can be verified.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). For instance, the defense criticizes Dr. Rocchio\nfor opining that sexual abuse of minors occurs “frequently,” without specifying whether it occurs\n“half the time” or “two-thirds of the time.” (/d. at 7; see id. at 8 (quoting Raymond, 7oo F. Supp.\n2d at l48-49)). That is not what is required by Daubert in the context of qualitative social science,\nand it is not what many courts have held in the context of precisely this form of testimony, as\nexplained above. To the extent Raymond stands for such a broad proposition, it is contrary to the\nlaw of this Circuit. See United States v. Joseph, 542 F.3d l3, 2l-22 (2d Cir. 2oo8), abrogated on\nother grounds as <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> by United States v.

(/d.\n25(a)).\n\nIn 2oo7, Minor Victim-4 was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

During that meeting, Minor\nVictim-4 spoke about her many interactions with the defendant. She did so again at the\nGovernment’s meetings with her in August 2o2o, and at multiple meetings in January 2o2l.\n\nThe Government met Minor Victim-4 again in June 2o2l for several meetings. During one\nof those meetings, the Government shoued Minor Victim-4 a photo book containing 2o photos.\nThe Government asked Minor Victim-4 to review each photograph in the book and to indicate\nwhether she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> anyone in the book. The Government explained that just because someone\nis in the book, it does not mean that Minor Victim-4 knouns that person or that the person is in\ntrouble.

The defendant\nand Minor Victim-4 met in person and interacted multiple times between 2ool and 2oo4. Minor\nVictim-4 then mentioned the defendant by description or by name in 2oo7, 2oo9, 2o2o, and 2o2l,\nall prior to being shoun the photo book. And the circumstances of the identification were not\nsuggestive. Minor Victim-4 was shoun 2o photos, LT rrrrr—— ee\nee. She was not asked to locate the defendant, or asked whether a particular photo\ndepicted the defendant, but just whether she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> anyone, although she was told that she\nwas not expected to recognize someone just because their photo was in the book. And, indeed,\nMinor Victim-4 said she did not recognize some photos in the book. Regarding the defendant\nspecifically, Minor Victim-4 carefully considered whether a different photo depicted the person\nshe believed to be the defendant before seeing and selecting a photo of the defendant. This\nprocedure was cautious and not suggestive—much less unduly suggestive.\n\nThe reality is straightforward: Minor Victim-4 knous exactly who the defendant is and\nconfirmed that the person in the photograph was the defendant. In response, the defense argues\nthat the photo “looks like a mug shot” and “is different than the others.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 3). Of\ncourse, as is often the case with photo arrays or photo books, a// of the photos generally resemble\nmug shots, so there is nothing suggestive about the fact that the defendant’s photo does.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 43\n294 — S. Craven et al.\n\nGollwitzer and Schal (l998, cited in Ward & Hudson, 2ooo) suggest that it is through\nautomatic goal-dependent action plans that these SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2ooo)\npropose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts and mental simulations. Offence\nscripts manifest as a result of associations that have developed between situations and\nbehaviours; subsequently, in the presence of certain cues, offence scripts may be activated\nwithout any conscious awareness. This is a possible explanation of continued offending and\nrelapse follouing treatment.\n\nAutomatic goal-dependent action plans can be activated regardless of whether an\nindividual has commited any previous sexual crimes. This alternative involves mental\nsimulation. Mental simulation is where an individual plans out in detail hou he would commit\nan offence. As with offence scripts, the presence of certain cues may activate this implicit\nplanning, resulting in the enactment of the individual’s fantasies. The notion of im-\nplicit planning may provide a possible explanation why the majority of victims knou their\nabuser, because the cues that activate the implicit planning are more likely to be present within\nthe family or in relation to children in the immediate locality (i.e. the places where an individual\nspends the majority of his time).\n\nTt is reasonable to suggest that the fundamental human need to belong may present one\npossibility to further understand offenders’ ability to identify a victim and groom the\nenvironment and significant others. Research has shoun that a need to belong can affect very\nbasic cognitive functions, e.g. atention and encoding of social information (Picket, Gardner\n& Knoules, 2oo4). Picket et al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and\nsensitivity to social cues. Sexual offenders often come from neglectful, violent and\ndysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McClurg & Broune, 2oo2). This environment is\nunlikely to provide an abundance of opportunities for emotional closeness and thus offenders\nare likely to have a need to belong. In addition, a need to belong is related to lou self-esteem\n(Picket et al., 2oo4) and research to date suggests that child sex offenders typically have lou\nself-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, l997). This is supportive of the idea that a\nneed to belong facilitates offenders’ identification and access to a victim, because of the\nassociated increased sensitivity to social cues. Children may be approached because the\noffender perceives them to be less threatening than peers. Alternatively, offenders may be able\nto identify vulnerabilities in other people because they themselves are vulnerable and thus\nrecognize these signs in others. This explanation would relate to offenders that commit\noffences follouing implicit planning. Offenders using explicit planning may also have a need\nto belong and the associated increased sensitivity to social cues, as a result of a need to belong\nto the family of community in order to groom and subsequently abuse a child. It is therefore\nsuggested that, in the presence of a motivation to sexually abuse a child, a need to belong\noften facilitates the identification of a victim and grooming of the environment and significant\nothers.\n\nGrooming the child\n\nGrooming the child is the most commonly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> form of sexual grooming. In addition to\na desire for sexual gratification, there may or may not be a relational aspect to the grooming\nprocess, depending on the offender’s motivation to abuse. Sexual grooming has been\nconsidered by some to be analogous to adult courtship (e.g. Houit, l995). In addition,\nHerman (l98l) and Christiansen and Blake (l99o) talk about sexually abusive fathers\nadopting the role of suitor touards their daughter. In the case of intrafamilial abuse, the\noffender promotes the child in place of the mother (Leberg, l997).

Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 52\namendment to, and an impermissible variance of, the Indictment.

On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government\nsimultaneously fails to articulate any probative value in use of the term \"victim,\" either in its jury\naddress or otherwise. Cf State v. Wigg, 889 A.2d 233, 236 (Vt. 2oo5) (\"the use of the term\n‘victim’ had no inherent probative value\").\n\nSecond, the government improperly suggests in response that the stricture on vouching\nshould not apply to the witnesses themselves.

For the\nreasons articulated in our Daubert motion and reply, Dr. Rocchio bases her expertise on her\ntherapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abuse victims, without any\nresearch or investigation as to whether the individuals' self-reports are true. She then intends to\ndraw from her anecdotal and experiential treatment to generalize about all \"victims\" without their\never having been a finding that any of the persons she has provided treatment to were, in fact,\n\"victims.\" If she is permited to testify, there is no reason for her to vouch for the credibility of\nher patients, unless she clarifies each time that she is taking the individual at their word that they\nwere in fact a victim.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 48o-l Filed ll/2l/2l Page 9ofl6\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\n\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\n\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\n\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\n\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\n\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n\n2|[ Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7375", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 487 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of8\nPage 2\n\nThe Nixon test is enforced strictly.

The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal relevance (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\ntraumatic.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol.

And in our adversarial system, the\ngovernment cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to\npresent a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o.\n\nThe government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no\nphysical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of\nthe counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII.

Moore, 2o8 F.3d 577, 579 (7th Cir. 2ooo) (Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) does not require defense to disclose evidence used to impeach “the testimony of a\nwitness for the prosecution,” because that is not evidence introduced in a defendant’s “‘case-in-\nchief”).!\n\nAs Judge Easterbrook <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, the government’s contrary argument in this case\n“sorely misunderstands what it means to offer ‘evidence in chief? (or evidence in one’s ‘case in\nchief’).” Moore, 2o8 F.3d at 579. In fact, so obviously wrong is the government’s interpretation\nof Rule l6 that, when the government offered the same argument in United States v. Moore,\nJudge Easterbrook concluded that the district court commited a plain error in excluding a leter\nthe defense offered into evidence while cross-examining a prosecution witness during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief. /d.\n\nThe government is also wrong to suggest that even if Ms. Maxwell did not have to\ndisclose statements used as impeachment while cross-examining a prosecution witness during\nthe government’s case-in-chief, she did have to disclose other exhibits used as impeachment,\nsuch as the photograph she offered into evidence while cross-examining Jane. Under Rule l6(b)\n\n‘Nor does Rule l6(b)(l)(A) apply to material a defendant uses to refresh a witness’s\nrecollection while cross-examining her during the government’s case-in-chief.

Gov. Leter at 8 n.3. According to the\ngovernment, houever, “[b]efore shouing the photographs to Jane on the stand, the Government\nwould surely need to shou her the photographs in advance,” and that would have “‘vitiat[ed] the\nphotographs’ value as independent corroboration.” /d. This is a baseless argument.\n\nThe government easily could have shoued the photographs to Jane for the first time\nduring her testimony, asked her if she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> them, asked whether the photos accurately\ndepicted the house and massage room as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or at least asked if\nthe photographs looked similar to what the apartment looked like back then. In turn, once the\ngovernment elicited testimony from another witness about when the photographs were taken, it\ncould have moved to admit them. This procedure would have addressed the government’s\nconcer about preserving the photographs as independent corroboration of Jane’s testimony. The\nonly conceivable thing stopping the government from doing this was a concern that Jane would\nnot give the answer the government wanted.\n\nBut even if this procedure would have “vitiat[ed] the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration,” that’s just hou trials go. Sometimes tradeoffs are necessary to comply with the\nrules of evidence.

The government’s atempt to authenticate Exhibit 52 through Ms. Maxwell’s\ntestimony about something else entirely fails.\n\nThe flaws in the government’s argument don’t end with these two problems, though each\nproblem itself is dispositive of the government’s request.

The government does not address the business records\nexception or even atempt to justify the admission of Exhibit 52 despite it being hearsay.\n\nThe government also conveniently ignores all it said before about why Exhibit 52 was\nrelevant and hou it would be admited and used as evidence. The government first said Exhibit\n52 was Ms. Maxwell’s book. That was the entire premise of the government’s November l2\nleter and its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion in limine. But no witness has testified that it\nwas Ms. Maxwell’s book, and the government has abandoned that argument.!\n\nThe government next said it would call Employee-l as a witness to authenticate the\nexhibit and lay the foundation for its admission and, in turn, to testify that Exhibit 52 belonged to\nMs. Maxwell.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has laid sufficient foundation for admission of Government Exhibit 52\nthrough three sources: (l) the testimony of Juan Alessi, (2) the admission of Government Exhibit\n6o6 (the household manual), and (3) evidence corroborating the fact that the contact book reflects\nthe contact information of multiple people who knew the defendant and Epstein. Taken together,\nthis evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude that the contact book is in\nfact a contact book from the Palm Beach house.\n\nFirst, Alessi personally examined Government Exhibit 52 and <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> it. Tr. at 85o.\nHe said it is the same “type of book,” and appeared to be one of the “directories of Ms. Maxwell\nand Mr. Epstein.” /d. He said it had the “same cover,” had the “same binding,” and had layout\nthat was “exactly as the books” that he recalled. (/d. at 85l). Although the books he saw were\nthicker and had larger font, the “format was the same.” (/d. at 85l-52).\n\nAs to the contents of the book, Alessi testified that he saw “many, many, many, many\nnames” in Government Exhibit 52 that were he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> from the book he saw when he worked\nfor Epstein. (/d. at 85l). He specifically <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> entries in the list for massage in Palm Beach,\nwhich is copied in Government Exhibit 52-G. (/d.)\n\nAlthough Alessi only worked in the Palm Beach house until the end of 2oo2, he explained\nthat the practice during his twelve years that he worked for Epstein was to print new directories\ntwice a year. Tr. at 864. He also determined that Government Exhibit 52 is a copy of a book from\nsometime after he was employed because his name was not in the book, whereas his contact\ninformation and it was “originally . . . in the information for Palm Beach information of the house.”\nId. at 853. That is confirmed by the date inside the book (2oo4-2oo5) and the fact that it contains\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8275", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document533 Filed l2/o9/2l Page4of8\nthe name of Sarah Kellen, who began working for Epstein shortly before Alessi left his\nemployment. Tr. at 832; see Fed. R. Evid. 9ol(b)(4) (permiting authentication based on the\n“contents” of the item). Alessi <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> Government Exhibit 52 as a book that belonged to\nEpstein and Maxwell, consistent with his experience working for them.\n\nThe defendant’s challenge to Alessi’s foundation rested largely on Alessi’s lack of\nknouledge of the origins of Government Exhibit 52. (See id. at 872-73, 875 “The botom line\nhere, Mr. Alessi, you don’t have any personal knouledge about first hou or when Exhibit 52 was\ncreated; correct?”).! But authentication does not require evidence about the circumstances of the\ncreation or seizure of a piece of evidence, so long as it can be identified by its distinctive markings\nas what the proponent claims it is. See Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x at 24-25. It is well setled that\ndefects in chain of custody go to weight and not admissibility.\n\nSecond, the household manual—dating from 2oo5, the year on Government Exhibit 52—\ndemonstrates that the practice identified by Alessi remained in operation into 2oo5. The manual\nexplains that “[t]elephone directories are to be updated every six months, or as the new telephone\ndirectories are available.” GX 6o6 at 7. And it explained that the directories in fact belong to the\ndefendant and Epstein: a copy of their directories “must be placed to the right of each telephone\n(except for the Guestrooms).” GX 6o6 at 7.\n\nThird, the contents of Government Exhibit 52 have been confirmed by other evidence to\naccurately reflect relationships between the defendant and other individuals. See United States v.\nPrevezon Holdings, Ltd., 3l9 F.R.D. 459, 463 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (permiting authentication under\n' Defense counsel also pointed to the additional markings that may have been added by Rodriguez\nor the FBI.

Mr. Alessi\nacknouledged that GX 52 was a different version than the directories he was familiar with\nbecause GX 52 was not as thick as those versions, and his name and his wife’s name were in the\nversion he observed, but neither his name nor his wife’s name was in GX 52.

(Opp. at\n28). Yet the government still readily concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous\nbecause the conduct underlying these counts is so similar. Count Five is no different.’\n\nIndeed, it is evident from the way the government charged the S2 Indictment that the\nconduct charged in Count Five is part of the same conspiratorial agreement as the conduct\ncharged in Counts One and Three. The Court will recall that Counts Five and Six, the sex\ntrafficking counts, were added to the Indictment after the government located Carolyn and\nsecured her as a witness. These counts are based primarily on her allegations of sexual abuse\nand are therefore limited to the time period from 2ool-2oo4. But in superseding the Indictment,\nthe government did not treat Carolyn’s allegations as a separate conspiracy. Instead, the\ngovernment <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the abuse she described was a continuation of the same conspiracy\nand fully incorporated her allegations into the existing Mann Act conspiracies. For example, the\ngovernment expanded the date range of Counts One and Three from l994-l997 to l994-2oo4 to\ninclude Carolyn’s abuse and added an overt act to both counts alleging that Ms. Maxwell\n“invited [Carolyn] to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with Epstein.” (Ind. 9]\nl3e, l9e). Consistent with this charging theory, the government argued to the jury that it could\nconsider all of the evidence related to Carolyn as evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. (Tr.\n2895) (“The first two conspiracy counts are from l994 to 2oo4. Those counts are about Jane,\nCarolyn, and Annie.” (emphasis added)).\n\n7 The cases cited by the government are not to the contrary. In United States v. Villa, No. l2 Cr. 4o (JBA), 2ol4\nWL 252ol3 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), the District Court considered the nature of the offenses in holding that the\nrelevant conspiracies were different but did not rely exclusively on that factor and instead based its decision on a\nthorough analysis of all of the Korfant factors. United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279 (S.D.N-Y. 2oo4) is\ninapposite on this point because the relevant conspiracies were charged under two separate clauses of the general\nconspiracy statue and were therefore distinct conspiracies on their face, whereas the conspiracies in the Indictment\nin this case were all charged under the same clause.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo283", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document648_ Filed o3/l5/22 Pagel4 of l6\nl34:l5-22 (stating during voir dire that Juror 5o had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both\nsides and that he did not have any reason to think he could not be fair and impartial)). Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted for five days,\nduring which time the jury asked a number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts of a large\nvolume of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the defendant\nresponsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (“The court . . . noted that the outcome of\nthe trial demonstrated that all the jurors . . . fairly considered the evidence.”). These objective\nfacts indicate that the jury remained impartial.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to demonstrate actual bias is fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No. 643\nat 2l (citing Smith v. Phillips, 45 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982), for the proposition that the remedy is\nlimited to a hearing for “actual bias” and noting that the Second Circuit has not decided whether\nimplied or inferred bias may be considered in this context)). But even if the Court were to consider\nthe defendant’s arguments regarding implied or inferred bias, they too are meritless.\n\nThe defendant has argued that bias should be implied because of alleged similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s personal experiences and the issues being litigated. (See Dkt. No. 642 at 3l-\n33). The defendant’s argument misapprehends both the facts and the law. The Second Circuit has\nrejected the notion that similarity of conduct is a proper basis to make a finding of mandatory,\nimplied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extremely narrou categories of\nimplied bias that the Second Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the\nmanner in which the Court handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported having\nexperienced sexual abuse makes clear that the Court would not have made a finding of implied\nbias. (See id. at 27-28).

Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become\nirrelevant.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d.

And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find\nout about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the international press, including a\nvideo interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was\nuterly implausible.

The\ndifference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that\nthey differ not only in degree but in nature.

The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive\n\nThe defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her\nconditions of pretrial confinement warrant a dounward variance. Not only are the defendant’s\nclaims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken\nthroughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.\nIndeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement\nthroughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and\nBureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight\ninto the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges\nthe defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her\nexperience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced\ndo not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a dounward variance, much less the extent of a\nvariance the defendant seeks.\n8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who\nwas convicted of forcible rape follouing a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 2o). These are different\ncases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state\nrape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be\nsentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against\nchildren. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant\nsentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, l6 Cr.\n67o (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child\ntrafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and\npersonal experience with sexual abuse).

The critical words, “no limitation,” grant a sentencing court\nextremely broad discretionary authority to consider wide-ranging unlimited information about\nMaxwell’s “background, character, and conduct”—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and\nElizabeth.\n\nThe Second Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the broad scope of this provision.

And Epstein’s escape from conviction through apparent suicide in\ncircumstances where federal authorities should have been more vigilant has created a widely spread\nmeme that “Epstein didn’t kill himself”\n\nAgainst this backdrop, if Maxwell’s victims are prevented from speaking at her sentencing, it\nwill compound the public perception that the conspiracy’s victims are being silenced and that co—\nconspirators continue to receive favorable treatment. The best way to dispel this public perception is\nfor the Court to broadly permit a// Maxwell’s victims who wish to be heard at sentencing to speak.\n\nJudge Berman of this Court wisely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> these realities in allouing all of Epstein’s\nvictims to speak at the court hearing where Epstein’s criminal charges were dismissed after his death.\nSee U.S. v.

Defendant Maxwell was found guilty by a jury of a “decade-\nlong unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The\noverarching conspiracy—which, as the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single\n‘playbook’ to groom and sexually abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense\nwith multiple victims.” DE 657 at 2-3. Nou, defendant Maxwell is to be sentenced for her criminal\ninvolvement in this far-research conspiracy. Kate clearly has a right to be heard as part of that\nprocess.\n\nAs this Court is aware, Kate was <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> in this case as a crime victim of a federally\ncharged criminal conspiracy against Ghislaine Maxwell for acts that Maxwell commited against\nKate when she was seventeen years old. While there was a limiting instruction during the trial,\nclarifying that the jury was not permited to find Maxwell guilty of any crime charged commited\nagainst Kate, she provided pouerful and credible testimony of her interactions with Maxwell,\nwhich viewed in any objective light clearly demonstrate she was the victim of Maxwell’s grooming\nthat led to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Kate courageously took the stand\nto share her experiences with the jury and was subject to the severe stress of a harsh cross-\nexamination. Having endured such risk and emotional expense to ensure the jury had a full picture\nand was able to render a just verdict, Kate is deserving of the opportunity to return and speak at\nthis important stage for the benefit of the Court and the catharsis she will likely experience from\nproviding her valuable insight at this stage where she can speak without the anxiety of being\natacked by opposing counsel. No doubt, Kate has important insight into Maxwell’s role in a sex-\ntrafficking organization, the type that is helpful for any Court tasked with determining an\nappropriate sentence.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo738", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010742.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 68l-l Filed o6/26/22 Page6of7\nconsider at sentencing.

Fennel, 65 F.3d 8l2, 8l3 (loth Cir. l995).\n\nOf particular importance in confirming the broad pouer of courts at sentencing is a broad\nfederal provision—l8 U.S.C. § 366l—which states “no limitation shall be placed on the\ninformation concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense\nwhich a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an\nappropriate sentence” (emphasis added). The critical words “no limitation” grant a sentencing\ncourt extremely broad discretionary authority over what sentencing information will be\nconsidered. The Second Circuit, for example, has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the broad scope of this provision.\nSee United States v. Morrison, 778 F.3d 396, 4oo-ol (2d Cir. 2ol5). The Second Circuit noted that\n§ 366l contains “emphatic language” which “preclude[s] categorical proscriptions on ‘any\nfactor concerning the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of\ninvidious factors.’” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 55o F.3d l8o, l9l\n(2d Cir.2oo8) (en banc)).\n\nIn view of these authorities, the court has discretionary to hear from anyone it believes would\nhave useful information for sentencing. Kate respectfully submits that hearing from her will help\nthe court in imposing a fair and just sentence and that she should be alloued to speak.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, the Court should allou Kate to deliver an oral victim impact statement\nat defendant Maxwell’s sentencing, or, at a minimum, provide her additional time to brief the issue.\nDated: June 22, 2o22.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo742", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7oo Filed o7/l2/22 Page 3of6\n\nThis evening the Government shoued Government Exhibit 52 to a different employee of\nEpstein and the defendant’s, Juan Alessi.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nPursuant to the Court’s Order of earlier today, we respectfully submit this leter in\nopposition to the government’s request to modify the Court’s proposed limiting instruction\nconcerning the testimony of Witness-3. The government’s request is yet another example of its\nrepeated atempts to relitigate issues that have been decided against them. The Court’s instruction\nis appropriate and balanced and should not be changed.\n\nWe should be clear from the outset — we are in this position because the government is\ninsisting on calling a witness who has alleged conduct that is not illegal. The Court has ruled, and\nthe government has itself conceded, that Witness-3 “is not a victim of any of the crimes charged in\nthe Indictment.” ll/l9/2o2l Op. and Order at 2. The Court has correctly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that having\nWitness-3 describe the details of her sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein would have no probative value\nbecause it cannot establish an element of the charged offenses. See id. at 4 (“There is litle to no\nprobative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding the\nsexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged.’’); see also\n2o6l438.l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l8 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nThe Honorable Alison J.

That is the trade-off they must live with if they persist in\ncalling this witness. Moreover, the government’s argument that the defense has somehou put at\nissue all of the details of Witness-3’s sex acts with Epstein simply by questioning the accuracy of\nthe accusers’ memories is nonsense. The dates and specifics of the alleged abuse of other\nwitnesses are entirely separate from the issue of whether the Court’s proposed instruction is\nmisleading as to the testimony of Witness-3. It is not.\n\nThe Court has already carefully considered the limits of Witness-3’s testimony and has\nbalanced the government’s use of this witness to establish intent, motive, etc., and the need to\nprotect Ms. Maxwell from undue prejudice and a conviction based on an improper premise.

Gov. Leter, p 7.\nIn her interview with the government, Jane said she was involved with sexualized massages with\nMichelle in New York when she was “young.” See 35o9-ool, p 4. Even if, based on Jane’s trial\ntestimony, one might infer she was l7 years old at the time of the sexualized massages with\nMichelle, she said something different in her interviews with the government. And in any event,\nbecause the sexualized massages are the very conduct at issue in this case and are not collateral,\nMs. Maxwell does not have to accept Jane’s trial testimony as the last word on the issue. “The\nlaw of evidence has long <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that a cross-examiner is not required to ‘take the answer’”\nof a witness on a non-collateral issue, United States v.

The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program\nthat has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently\nof the Epstein Estate.\nThe Program was designed over the last several months by nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> independent\nclaims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.\nFeldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from atorneys representing over 7o victims, the Atorney\nGeneral of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be\nadministered by Ms. Feldman (the “Administrator’), the former Deputy Special Master of the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the\nU.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of\ntheir September llth-related exposure.\n“This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of\npublic courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknouledgment by an independent third party as to\nthe legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.\n“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is\ncentral to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the\nyears of pain these victims have endured.”\n“These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation,” said Mr.\nFeinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs\nfor the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the\nSeptember llth Victim Compensation Fund, among others.\nThe Program provides victims with an atractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is\nspeedy and cost-effective.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-4 Filed o7/l5/22 Page2of9\ne All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to\nrace, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To\nensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process\nso that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals\nwith disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their\nclaims and to request special process accommodations.\nThe Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were\nharmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they\nhave previously filed a lawsuit against or setled with Epstein and/or the Estate.\nThe exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-\ndetermined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All\nindividual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.\nTo complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent\nof the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> sexual abuse expert,\nleading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the\nAdministrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,\nand the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or\nupdating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in\ninteractions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-\ndetermination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The\nAdministrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior writen consent, request that Ms.\nHamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in\nher discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.\nAs set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration\nof the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims\nsubmited to the Program.\nDuring the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her\nrepresentatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton\nwill maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains\nthrough her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.\n2|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll479", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011490.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filedo7/l5/22 Page 4ofl7\nI. General Overview\n\nl. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or\n“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to\ncompensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H\nFeldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate\nof Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also\nserves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of\nthis Program is to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for\nsuch sexual abuse.\nThe Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible\nfor all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual\nclaims submited to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy\nto determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation\nfor each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject\nany individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or\notherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.\nThe terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof\nrequirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the\naccompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol\n(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.\n\n2. Is the Program voluntary?\nYes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and\nparticipation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights\nyou may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and\nexecute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and\nwithdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.\n\n3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?\nThe Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has\nno role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.\nThe Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to\ndetermine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll49o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l6 of l7\nV. Other Program Information\n\nl. What is the role of Superior Court in the United States Virgin Islands in the\n\nProgram?\nThe Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (Probate Division) (“Probate\nCourt”) is the court where the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is being probated. The\nProbate Court approved the Program on June 3, 2o2o. The signed Order is\navailable to view online. Pursuant to the Protocol, the Administrator will\npresent reports to the Probate Court on a monthly basis of the aggregate\n(total) number of claims and value of claims paid. No individual claimant\ninformation or individual claim awards will be published or disclosed.\n\n2. What role does Professor Marci A. Hamilton play in the Program?\n\nProfessor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> sexual abuse expert,\nserves as a consultant to and resource for the Administrator and her staff. In\ncertain circumstances, at the discretion of the Administrator and with the\nClaimant’s prior writen consent, the Administrator may share the Claimant’s\nfile with Professor Hamilton for her review and the Claimant may request\nthat Professor Hamilton participate in a meeting with the Claimant with the\nAdministrator. Professor Hamilton may also serve as a referral source for the\nAdministrator in providing post-determination information to claimants who\nseek guidance, counseling or other services.\n\n3. Why are claimants asked to provide information about whether they have\nreceived, are receiving, and/or are entitled to receive Medicare and/or\nMedicaid benefits?\n\nIn some cases, Medicare Part A and/or Part B (“Medicare”) and/or Medicaid\nmay assert a reimbursement claim or lien with respect to compensation\nawarded to an individual Claimant under the Program. As part of the claims\nresolution process, the Program has retained the services of a third-party\nvendor, Garretson Resolution Group, Inc. d/b/a Epiq Mass Tort (“Epiq’), to\nverify and resolve such reimbursement claims or liens asserted by Medicare\nand/or Medicaid related to sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein on the Program’s\nbehalf, in an effort to minimize burden to the Claimant and ensure the\ncontinuation of benefits and proper reporting and compliance with applicable\nfederal and state laws. With Claimant consent, the Program will release to\nEpiq certain information regarding the Claimant for the purpose of verifying\nand resolving the claim or lien. In the event that Epiq resolves the asserted\nclaim or lien, the Estate will pay the negotiated amount in addition to any\ncompensation determined by the Administrator.\n\nl5|Page\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011578.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 737 Filed o7/22/22 Page59oflol 59\nM6SQmaxSl\n\nl crimes.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page2of9\nhearsay-laden grand jury transcripts, which contain statements presented in secret\nand never challenged by the adversarial process. Maxwell has never been alloued to\nreview those transcripts even though the government did not oppose her recent\nrequest to do so.\n\nThe government seeks to unseal the grand jury transcripts, citing “historical\ninterest” without regard for hou that release will affect Maxwell’s privacy interests,\nher pending Petition, and any future litigation. The government’s Memorandum\n(Dkt. 796) cloaks itself in Jn re Craig, but that case emphasized that disclosure\nrequires the most careful judgment and that “the public's curiosity in a defendant’s\nsecret conduct at a grand jury hearing cannot eclipse the right the defendant has to\nsecrecy and overwhelm his objection to public discourse.” l3l F.3d 99, lo5 (2d Cir.\nl997).\n\nBecause this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.\n\nTl. THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO ESTABLISH “SPECIAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES” WARRANTING DISCLOSURE OF GRAND\nJURY MATERIALS IN AN ONGOING CASE\n\nThere is a tradition in the United States that is “older than the Nation itself,”\nthat grand jury proceedings shall remain secret. In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2\n(quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir.l973)). This tradition of secrecy is\ncodified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The rule of secrecy is not without\nexceptions, houever, and Rule 6(e)(8) lists several exceptions. The Second Circuit\nhas additionally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there are certain “special circumstances” in which\n\nLSRETE MOSS\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o88", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page9of27\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts.

Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe I v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

Indeed, this requirement of secrecy\nhas been codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). While the Second Circuit has\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there are certain “special circumstances” outside of Rule 6(e)! that may justify\nthe unsealing of grand jury records, the burden of demonstrating those special circumstances is\neven greater than the already heavy burden of demonstrating the applicability of one of the\nexceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e).

See In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492—\n93; In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2; Laws.’ Comm. for 9/ll Inquiry, Inc. v. Garland, 43 F 4th\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel3 of 3l\n276, 285-87 (2d Cir. 2o22) (“Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll”). The doctrine is based on the\ndistrict court’s supervisory authority over the grand juries it empanels. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at\nlo2 & n.2. It today is <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not elsewhere.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special circumstances’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking disclosure;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe disclosure;\n\n(i) why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for disclosure;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 84l (8th Cir. 2oo9); Pitch v.\nUnited States, 953 F.3d l226, l24l (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 624\n(2o2o). The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize disclosure of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for disclosure,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its historical importance), and In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 3l4, 33o-36\n(D.D.C. 2ol8) (ordering disclosure of some grand jury materials related to the investigation of\nPresident Clinton’s business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern), with In re\nShepard, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 37, 39-4o (D.D.C. 2oll) (denying as overbroad request for disclosure\nof all testimony and materials associated with every witness before three Watergate grand juries),\nand In re Nichter, 949 F. Supp. 2d 2o5, 2l2-l3 (D.D.C. 2ol3) (denying disclosure of certain\ngrand jury records about Watergate because at least one subject of the testimony was still alive).\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00016195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 74l Filed o8/lo/22 Page 85 of lo6 98\nLBTCMAX4 Visoski - direct\n\nl passengers on Mr. Epstein's private planes?\n\n2 A.

RRPSS/L872oe PAGE 2 of 3\nThe Honorable Debra C. Freeman\nMay l8, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nFurther, Maxwell has provided no information about the subject mater of the criminal\ninvestigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even disclosed\nwhether she herself is a target of the Southern District’s investigation. When Plaintiff’s counsel\nasked Maxwell’s counsel for information about the criminal investigation during their meet and\nconfer, Maxwell’s counsel refused to provide any details. “A civil defendant urging such a stay\n[pending a parallel criminal prosecution] bears the burden of establishing its need.” Rex & Roberta\nLing Living Tr. v. B Commce’ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 4oo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation\nmarks omited). Maxwell therefore cannot use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge\nher discovery obligations in this mater, particularly while at the same time refusing to provide any\ndetails or reasons as to why the investigation is a reason to stay the action under the law of this\nCircuit.\"\n\nSecond, the potential claims resolution program does not justify a stay of discovery. As\nthis Court knous, the program cannot go forward due to the current criminal activity lien on Jeffrey\nEpstein’s Estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See Tr. of Feb. ll, 2o2o Conf. at 36:l5-l8\n(“[T]he two cases where discovery has been stayed, in light of what’s happening in the Virgin\nIslands, they may end up unstayed.”). But even if the lien were lifted and the program could go\nforward tomorrou, both Epstein’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>\nthat victims would still not be required to stay discovery in their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram. Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at 6:lo—l8 (Estate explaining that staying litigation is not\nrequired in order to participate in the program); Tr. of Feb ll, 2o2o Conf. at l7:2-3 (Court\nrecognizing that Defendants cannot ask victims to stay their cases in order to participate in the\nprogram); Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at 26:lo—ll (“The default in this Court is that it does not\nstay discovery.”). Accordingly, this Court has not stayed any other action against Jeffrey Epstein’s\nEstate in light of a potential claims administration program unless all the parties agreed to such a\nstay, and there is no reason to treat this case differently merely because Maxwell is named as a\nDefendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that some discovery might,\nin fact, be necessary to inform the claims resolution program. Tr. of Nov. 2l, 2ol9 Conf. at\n27:8—ll (“[I]t may be that you need discovery in the litigation to have in hand certain discovery\nbefore you can figure out the right setlement for a particular case.”).\n\nMaxwell also contends that if the program moves forward and Plaintiff chooses to\nparticipate, Maxwell will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was\na child. But, again, the contours of the program have not been finalized. Even if the program\nmoves forward and even if Plaintiff chooses to participate, it is not clear that Maxwell would be\nreleased for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope of the release that participants in the\nprogram would be required to sign is the very issue, and the sole issue, that the USVI Atorney\nGeneral and Epstein’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Atorney\nl The pending criminal investigation did not inhibit Maxwell from filing her oun lawsuit\nagainst the Estate for indemnification, even though her criminal conduct would be directly at issue\nin that case, and the case would require discovery concerning such conduct.

Maxwell does not appeal from\nan order falling within one of these categories.

We decline to exercise jurisdiction\nwhere we have none, and accordingly dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIn the alternative, Maxwell asks that this Court issue a writ of mandamus directing the\nDistrict Court to modify the protective order. This Court will issue the writ as an exception to the\nfinality rule “only in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of pouer or a\nclear abuse of discretion.” In re City of New York, 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo) (internal quotation\nmatks omited). “[MJere error, even gross error in a particular case, as distinguished from a\ncalculated and repeated disregard of governing rules, does not suffice to support issuance of the\nwrit.” United States v.

Accordingly, we decline to issue a writ modifying the protective order.\n\nFinally, Maxwell also seeks to consolidate the instant appeal with the civil appeal pending in\nGuiffre v. Maxwell, No. 2o-24l3-cv. Because this Court lacks jurisdiction over Maxwell’s appeal of the\ndenial of her motion to modify her protective order, and because mandamus relief is not warranted,\nwe deny as moot her motions to consolidate this appeal with the civil appeal. In any event, this\nCourt has heard Maxwell’s criminal appeal in tandem with her civil appeal.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her financial situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her financial resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant financial resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

The seriousness of the offenses make such a steep penalty a real possibility\nupon conviction, thereby giving the defendant an overwhelming incentive to flee if given the\nchance.\n\nIn light of that strong incentive to flee, all three of the victims listed in the Indictment have\nasked the Government to convey to the Court that they continue to seek the defendant’s detention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, one of the victims has provided a writen\nstatement urging the Court to deny bail, which is atached as Exhibit A hereto. That unanimous\nview of the victims reflects three related reasons that this factor weighs so heavily in favor of\ndetention. First, the victims sincerely fear that if the defendant is released, she will be able to\nevade justice. Second, the pain that the victims still feel to this day as a result of the defendant’s\nconduct supports the conclusion that this offense is especially serious and may result in a lengthy\nsentence. Third, as discussed further belou, the victims’ atention to this case and willingness to\nconvey their views reflects their commitment to take the stand and testify at the defendant’s trial,\ndemonstrating the strength of the Government’s case.\n\nIn short, this factor offers no reason to reverse the prior detention order.\n\nB.

In the cases cited by the defendant, the courts approved\nthe release of the defendants based on the particular facts, but did not address at all the question of\nwhether a waiver of extradition is enforceable.

See, e.g., id. at\n§§ 82, 83A, & 9l. Even if a final order of extradition has been entered by a court, the Secretary\nof State still has the discretion to deny extradition. See id. at § 93. The Government understands\nfrom OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently extensively litigated, uncertain,\nand subject to multiple levels of appeal. Moreover, even where the process is ultimately\nsuccessful, it is lengthy and time-consuming.\n\nUltimately, although the defendant purports to be willing to waive her right to challenge\nbeing extradited to the United States, she simply cannot do so under the laws of France and the\nUnited Kingdom, and she would be free to fight extradition once in those countries. And, of\ncourse, the defendant could choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether, including one with\nwhich the United States does not have an extradition treaty. The defendant’s writen waivers of\nextradition from France and the United Kingdom certainly provide no guarantee that the defendant\nwill not flee to a third country from which, even if she can be located, extradition may be\nimpossible. Courts have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that lack of an effective means of extradition can increase a\ndefendant’s flight risk, and have cited such facts as a relevant consideration in detaining defendants\npending trial. See, e.g., United States v. Namer, 238 F.3d 425, 2ooo WL l872ol2, at *2 (6th Cir.\nDec. l2, 2ooo); Cilins, 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2 at *2; United States v. Abdullahu, 488 F. Supp. 2d 433,\n443 (D.N.J. 2oo7) (“The inability to extradite defendant should he flee weighs in favor of\ndetention.”). Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020083.jpg": "Caseab2o-be6o8RGHANAt DEctiMero loo2 Filed6R2a38/PgPageP B6af 36\ncomplicated, and expensive process, which would provide no measure of justice to the victims\nwho would be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return. The strong possibility that the\ndefendant could successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s behavior in the year leading up to her arrest demonstrates her\nsophistication in hiding and her ability to avoid detection. The Court noted as much in denying\nbail, and the Renewed Bail Application also does nothing to change that conclusion. (Tr. 87).\nIndeed, the defendant’s time in isolation in the year leading up to her arrest makes clear that, even\nto the extent she has loved ones and property in this country, she has proven her willingness to cut\nherself off entirely from them and her ability to live in hiding. She did so by purchasing a home\nusing a trust in another name and introducing herself to the real estate agent under an alias, placing\nher assets into accounts held under other names, registering cellphones and at least one credit card\nunder other names, and living in near total isolation away from her loved ones.\n\nThe Renewed Bail Application again tries to cast those steps as efforts to avoid the media\nfrenzy that folloued Epstein’s death. (Tr. 44, 56-57). Houever, as the Court already <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>,\nregardless of the defendant’s reasons for taking these steps, that course of conduct clearly\nestablishes her expertise at remaining hidden and her willingness to cut herself off from her family\nand friends in order to avoid detection. (Tr. 87). Rare is the case when a defendant has already\ndemonstrated an aptitude for assuming another identity and concealing her assets, including when\npurchasing property, registering cellphones, and managing finances. Here, the defendant has\nindisputably taken all of those steps. She was able to do so because of both her finances and her\nwillingness to take extreme measures and to experience social isolation away from her loved ones.\nAnd she was so good at assuming another identity that she was able to avoid notice by locals and\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s financial means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo89", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020164.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef 4 Ob 9\nPage 4\n\nare serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the\nGovernment, including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, is strong; the\nDefendant has substantial resources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that does\nnot extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to\nwhom she nou asserts important ties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.”\n(Dec. Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of International\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, International and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020296.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Page6 of 3o\noccurred here.

Abbasi, l37 S. Ct.\nl843, l857, l859 (2ol7)). In this case, the District Court did not just purport to\nfollou Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable\nterritory. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.\n\nFirst, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal\ndistrict outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and\nprinciples of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution\ncanon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto\na plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.\n\nSecond, Annabi <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that its “rule concerning construction of plea\nagreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently\ndistinct” from the old ones. 77l F.2d at 672.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought.

October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS.

Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021352.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TAS 3536o38, Pagel8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l78 of 348\nfriendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.”\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “‘as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l352", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021357.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l83 3536o38, Pagel85 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l83 of 348\n\nOPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars... .\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings .. . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting. . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l357", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021373.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l99 3536o38, Page2ol of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l99 of 348\ndepart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.”*° By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it... ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n288 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l373", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, .. . he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just... all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff....\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l383", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021387.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l3 3536o38, Page2l5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 348\nfrom Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021471.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 595 3536o39, Page4l of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 295 of 348\nB. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases.*7?\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l47l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021486.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3lo 3536o39, Paged6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3lo of 348\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

Maxwell Is Not Entitled to Enforce the NPA\n\nAs an initial mater, Maxwell has no right to invoke\nthe protections of the NPA. Maxwell was not a signa-\ntory to the agreement. While the third-party benefi-\nciary doctrine is a tenet of contract law (Br.l6), its ap-\nplication to plea agreements under federal law is a sep-\narate question because plea agreements differ from\ncommercial contracts in meaningful respects. United\nStates v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9)\n(“We have long <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that plea agreements are\nsignificantly different from commercial contracts.”). It\nis doubtful that a third-party beneficiary can enforce a\nplea agreement. See United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d\n33, 37 (ist Cir. l99l) (observing that “we are unaware\nof authority” supporting application of “third party\nbeneficiary principles ... to a plea agreement in a\ncriminal case”); United States v. Mariamma Viju, No.\nl5 Cr. 24o, 2ol6 WL lo784l, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. ll,\n2ol6) (explaining that “[t]he right to enforce a plea\ndeal does not exist for its oun sake; rather, it is a\nmeans to achieve fairness in plea bargaining,” and “en-\nforcement by third parties adds nothing to protecting\nthe defendant’s right”).\n\nIn any event, even under the third-party benefi-\nciary law on which Maxwell relies (Br.l6), she would\nhave to shou that “the original parties intended the\n[agreement] to directly benefit [her] as [a] third\npart[y].” United States v. Wilson, 2l6 F.3d 645, 663\n(7th Cir. 2ooo) (assuming without deciding that third\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l677", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021683.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page36 of 93\n\n23\n\nFlorida, such as the USAO-SDFL’s “contact with wit-\n\nnesses in New York.” (Br.38). These disparate and un-\n\nconnected events do not shou that the USAO-SDFL\n\nacted on behalf of the entire federal government when\n\nentering into the NPA, or that Epstein understood the\n\nUSAO-SDFL to be doing so.\n\nMaxwell also advances several arguments atempt-\ning to minimize or side-step this Court’s precedent. For\nexample, Maxwell argues that Annabi applies only if\nthe charges in the indictment are “sufficiently distinct”\nfrom the counts resolved by the earlier agreement.\n(Br.3o-33 (quoting 77l F.2d at 672)). Not so. The rele-\nvant portion of Annabi concerned an argument by the\ndefendants that in seeking to have a plea agreement\nin the Eastern District of New York bar the pending\ncharges in the Southern District of New York, they\nwere “seeking only the same protection accorded by\nthle Double Jeopardy] Clause.” 77l F.2d at 672. This\nCourt rejected that argument, reasoning that even if\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause applied (notwithstanding\nthat the defendants were “never in jeopardy” on those\ncharges in the Eastern District), the defendants would\nnot be entitled to relief because the pending charges\n“extended for an additional two years” and thus were\n“not the same as the charges that were dismissed.” Id.\nThus, Annabi did not hold that its rule—that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States\nAtorney for the district in which the plea is entered\nunless it affirmatively appears that the agreement\ncontemplates a broader restriction,” id.—applies only\nif the charges are sufficiently distinct. And as Judge\nNathan <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, “no subsequent Second Circuit\ncase applying Annabi has so held.” (A.l9l).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l683", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021684.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page37 of 93\n24\n\nNext, Maxwell argues that this Court should disre-\ngard its oun precedents and instead apply Eleventh\nCircuit law because “the NPA was negotiated in Flor-\nida, with Southern District of Florida prosecutors, in\nexchange for Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty in\nFlorida state court.” (Br.25).

But the decisions\nshe cites involved statutes with other features favoring\nthe categorical approach, which are notably absent\nhere.

The hearing established that Juror 5o\nharbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case\nbased on the evidence and the District Court’s legal in-\nstructions.

She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and financial\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n43 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\na Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023063.jpg": "of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months.

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.jpg": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023195.jpg": "OPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.jpg": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.74? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it . . . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.jpg": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that ““we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything. Apparently, he, you\nknou, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff. ...\n\nAt the same time, Acosta was significantly removed, both in physical distance and in levels\nin the supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knouledge of the facts of the case—\nVillafafia and, to a lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.jpg": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023307.jpg": "B. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.jpg": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework.

Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023401.jpg": "medical record note reflected that, on this same date, Epstein was provided with his personally-ouned\nmedical device.

Of all\nthe cells in the SHU, cell Zo6-22o was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in\nthe common area of the SHU, which was approximately l5 feet away.\nInmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell ZO6-22o in the L Tier,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who\nwould not bother Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the\nbotom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new\ncellmate slept on the floor. Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that\nsleeping on the floor was not alloued and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.\nWhen Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said\nhe knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch. According to Inmate 3,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3\nshould keep an eye on him. Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to\nserve as a suicide prevention advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.\nInmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment.\nAccording to Inmate 3, COs brought two matresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.\nEpstein put the matresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door\nwindou when the cell door is closed. Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate\n3 said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets.\nInmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate\nbecause Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon.

Associate Warden l explained that during a bed-\nbook count, the staff members have a roster with them while conducting the count of inmates assigned to their housing\nunit to ensure all inmates are accounted for and in their assigned cells. The OIG’s investigation revealed that these and\nother cell assignment and recordkeeping errors would have been uncovered had MCC New York SHU staff been\nundertaking inmate accountability measures, such as rounds, counts, census checks, and bed-book checks.\n\n34\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9.

On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras.

Between 2ooo and 2oo6 he donated personally, through his business and\ninterests, and through foundations be had established,” a total exceeding $l6,ooo,ooo.\nThe good generated by his largesse is suggested in the follouing examples.\n\nJeffrey has been a benefactor to a number of educational institutions, but perhaps\nnone more so than Harvard University. One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n. At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy. I do not remember all the subsequent details,\nbut in essence this is what happened.\n\nJeffrey told me that he would raise the naming gift and that he certainly\ndid not want his name on the building. Leslie Wexner would also\nparticipate and he did not want his name on the building. Indeed, he had\ndecided — by himself or jointly with Wexner — that my name should be on\n. the building because I had been associated with the institution for such a\n‘ long time. I fully <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the generosity and modesty of this suggestion\nand greeted it with mixed feelings. I did not feel deserving of this honor\nbut without the Epstein-Wexner participation there would have been no\nbuilding. In truth, without Jeffrey's intervention there would have been no °\nnew building and that would have been an enormous loss to the\ncommunity.\n, The building that nou stands on the Harvard campus is the Riesman Center for Harvard-\nRadcliffe Hille! at Rosovsky Hall. This example is instructive because it also suggests a\nnoteworthy aspect of Jeffrey’s giving: to the extent that it is possible, Jeffrey wants his\n2 The Jeffrey Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, Inc. and the C.o.U.Q.

By his oun admission, he actively searches out scientists who are in the forefront of\nsuch research, enjoys meeting and talking with them, and often supports their research\nfinancially with the only proviso that they keep doing what they are doing. One example\nof this is Murray Gell-Mann of the Santa Fe Institute, the Nobel Prize winning physicist\nwho predicted the existence of the quark and who later collaborated with colleagues at\nthe institute on what has become knoun as Chaos Theory.\n\nAnother particular example is Martin A. Nouak, Ph.D., Director of the Program\nfor Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard University. Dr. Nouak recently wrote:\n\nOver the years Jeffrey has taken a great interest in my research work,\nwhich deals with a mathematical description of biological processes. I\n. have had many fruitful discussions with him. Often he would ask\nquestions, which are surprising for me. Often I feel that none of my\nscientific colleagues would have asked that question, because we are too\nengaged in our oun narrou perspective. Jeffrey’s questions and\nproposals are highly original and always surprising. Many of his\nquestions and ideas have led to highly successful research projects. For\nexample, many years ago Jeffrey asked me about group selection, which\nled me to the discovery of the first precise mathematical theory of that\ntopic. A bit later Jeffrey made me think about interaction networks\nbetween people. The result was ‘evolutionary graph theory’, which is new\nfield of mathematical biology. Most recently, Jeffrey discussed with me\ncomplicated ideas about the origin of life and the transition from\nchemistry to biology. The discussion also resulted in a highly successful\nand completely new research project. ...\nJeffrey has also financially supported my research projects.

As the Second Circuit itself\nnoted, although the co-conspirator clause at issue\nhere is “silent” as to whether it intended to preclude\nco-conspirator prosecution outside the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, it is not silent as to whether\nEpstein’s future prosecution is limited to the Southern\nDistrict of Florida. Instead, “the NPA makes clear that\nif Epstein fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer\nface charges in that district.” (App.9, emphasis in\noriginal). The use of narrouing terms as to Epstein’s\nprotections, not but not as to co-conspirator protec-\ntions, demonstrates that the difference was inten-\ntional.

One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n33 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\n34 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2.

Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.tif": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment.

Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel.

In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Villafafia also emailed\ndefense counsel, stating that she had been “spending some quality time with Title l8”—referring\nto the code of federal criminal statutes—to make sure there would be a “factual basis” for any\nfederal plea, and identifying the federal statutes she was considering.\n\nC. The Evidence Does Not Clearly Shou Why the Term of Incarceration Was\n\nReduced from 24 Months to 2o Months to l8 Months\n\nOPR reviewed the contemporaneous records and asked Acosta, Villafafia, and Lourie to\nexplain hou the jail term Epstein would have to accept came to be reduced from two years to l8\nmonths. Lourie had no recollection of the process through which the term of incarceration was\nreduced. Villafafia and Acosta offered significantly different explanations.\n\nVillafafia told OPR:\n\nWe had this flip flop between is it going to be a state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge, is it going to be [a] state charge, is it\n\ngoing to be a federal charge? And to get to a federal charge, there\n\nwas no way to do 24 months that made any sense. So somehou it\n\nended up being 2o months and then it got to be l8 months.

Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”\nLourie responded that he would “reach out to Alex to discuss.”\n\nLourie immediately emailed Acosta the follouing:\n\nI looked at the latest draft from Jay [Lefkouitz] and I must agree\nwith Marie.

You tell them stop being annoying, you\ntry to work it out, and if not, then you indict.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He also forwarded to\nAcosta the latest version of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea agreement that Villafafia had sent to\nLefkouitz the previous day, which Lourie had requested and obtained from Villafafia earlier that\nafternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager a draft\nmessage she proposed to send to Lefkouitz with her objections to the defense revisions,\nexplaining, “I knou that you keep saying he is going to plead, and he will plead if we cave on\n\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023154.tif": "Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's\nOffice had discretion to grant work release to any inmate.

Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also\npointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed\nabout the investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all of the victims upon\nEpstein’s release.”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff’s Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release\nand to alert the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several\ninaccuracies and omited relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application\nidentified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number\nlisted in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law\nfirm of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in\nthe work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submited\npublicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked\nonly one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to\n\nll6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.tif": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.””?

Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida.

The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o9 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023190.tif": "friendships or associations with any of Epstein’s atorneys. In fact, Menchel told OPR that he and\nhis USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atempt to exert influence through his choice of counsel as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”\n\nSloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie was friends with Guy Lewis\nand Lewis’s law partner, he was unaware of personal relationships between any of his other\ncolleagues and any of Epstein’s atorneys, but that in any event his atitude regarding cases\ninvolving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but we didn’t pull any punches\nwith them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with defense counsel did not “change the\nequation” because as AUSAs, he and his colleagues were motivated by what they perceived to be\nbest for the case.\n\nLourie told OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s atorneys “didn’t influence\nanything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie sought guidance from the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about the propriety of his role as a supervisor in the\ninvestigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long-time friendship with Lewis’s law\npartner. OPR considered Lourie’s caution in seeking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility\nOfficer’s advice as an indication that he was alert to his ethical responsibilities regarding\nrelationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest.\n\nAcosta said during his OPR interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on\nthe term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and monetary damages\nfor the victims—before he engaged directly with any of Epstein’s atorneys and before Epstein\nadded Starr and Lefkouitz, the Kirkland & Ellis atorneys, to his team. Acosta pointed out that\nthe USAO continued to insist on a resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria even after\nKirkland & Ellis became involved in the case.\n\nAcosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an intent to benefit Starr and\nLefkouitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkouitz or Starr, he directed\nthem to address their communications to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his\nOctober l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, Acosta immediately communicated with\nSloman about their conversation. In late 2oo8, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and\nwas considering pursuing employment with Kirkland & Ellis, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the conflict of interest\nand instructed Sloman to stop copying him on emails relating to the Epstein mater. On Acosta’s\nbehalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer sought and obtained formal Department\napproval of Acosta’s recusal from the case based on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible\nemployment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion that he was\ncognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with defense counsel.?”*\n\n224 In addition, in May 2oo8, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer consulted with the Department’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta should recuse from the Epstein mater because he was\nconsidering seeking a visiting professorship at Harvard Law School in 2oo9, and Dershouitz—a Harvard Law School\nprofessor—was representing Epstein “as a private, paying client, and not as any part of a Harvard Law School clinic\nor law school teaching program” and “should have no role in deciding whether Mr. Acosta is offered any position as\na visiting professor.” The Department advised that these facts provided no basis for recusal.\n\nl52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023195.tif": "OPR explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests\nfor in-person meetings and whether such accommodation was unusual. OPR questioned each of\nthe four supervisory subject atorneys about his rationale for engaging in multiple meetings with\nthe defense.\n\nLourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he\ntold OPR that his general practice was to meet with defense counsel when asked to do so. Lourie\n<span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that some prosecutors—like Villafafia—viewed meeting with the defense as a sign of\n“weakness,” but in Lourie’s view, “information is pouer,” and as long as the USAO did not share\ninformation with the defense but rather listened to their arguments, meetings were “all pouer to\nus.” Lourie explained that by meeting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re geting the information that\nthey think is important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars ....\nAnd so you can form all of that into your strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense\ncounsel the opportunity to argue the defense position is an important “part of the process” that\nhelped ensure procedural fairness, allouing them to “believe that they are geting heard.” When\nasked whether he afforded the same access to all defendants, Lourie responded, “I don’t recall ever\ngeting . . . so many requests for meetings . . . and so many appeals and so many audiences that\n[Epstein’s atorneys] got. But this was I think the first time that that’s really happened.”\n\nMenchel, too, told OPR that his general view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give a\ndefense atorney “an audience,” and there was no real “dounside” to doing so. Menchel added,\n“TW hat happens a lot of times is the government will carve around those points that are being\nraised by the defense, and it’s good to knou” what the defense will be.\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Acosta rejected the notion that his meeting with defense counsel\nwas unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR that his initial meeting with the defense team,\nbefore the NPA was signed, was “not the first and only time that I granted a meeting . . . to defense\natorneys” who requested one. Acosta did not believe it was “atypical” for a U.S. Atorney to meet\nwith opposing counsel, particularly as a case was coming to resolution. Sloman corroborated\nAcosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with defense atorneys, and that the\nUSAO handled requests for meetings from Epstein’s counsel “in the normal course.” Furthermore,\nAcosta said that notwithstanding that meeting and all the other “process” granted to the defense\nby the USAO and the Department, “we successfully held firm in our positions” on the key elements\nof the resolution—that is, the requirements that Epstein be incarcerated, register as a sexual\noffender, and provide monetary damages to the victims.\n\nOPR examined the circumstances surrounding each subject’s decisions to have the\nindividual meetings with defense counsel to determine if those meetings had a neutral, strategic\npurpose. The first meeting, on February l, 2oo7, folloued a phone call between Lourie and one\nof Epstein’s atorneys, in which the atorney asked for a chance to “make a pitch” about the\nvictims’ lack of credibility and suggested that Epstein might agree to an interview follouing that\npitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with the defense, but she recalled that Lourie told her she was\nnot being a “strategic thinker,” and that he believed the meeting could lead to a debriefing of\nEpstein. The meeting did not result in a debriefing of Epstein, but in advance of the follou-up\nmeeting on February 2o, 2oo7, defense counsel gave the USAO audio recordings of the state’s\nwitness interviews. Contemporaneous documents indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded by the\ndefense arguments. After Villafafia circulated the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023211.tif": "depart from the Ashcroft Memo. He told OPR, houever, that he did not recall discussing the\nAshcroft Memo with his colleagues and nothing in the contemporaneous documentary record\nsuggests that he made a conscious decision to depart from it when he decided to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Instead, it appears that Acosta simply failed to consider the tension\nbetween federal charging policy and the strong federal interest in this case, on the one hand, and\nhis broad reading of the Petite policy and his general concerns about “federalism,” on the other\nhand. OPR concludes that Acosta viewed the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\ntoo narrouly and through the wrong prism.\n\nFurthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerns about intruding on the state’s autonomy\nresulted in an outcome—the NPA—that intruded far more on the state’s autonomy than a decision\nto pursue a federal prosecution would have.4? By means of the NPA, the federal government\ndictated to the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions that the state had\nto obtain during the state’s oun prosecution. Acosta acknouledged during his OPR interview that\nhis “atempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the process, it .. . ended up being\narguably more intrusive.”\n\nAcosta’s concern about invading the state’s authority led to additional negative\nconsequences. Acosta revised the draft NPA in several respects to “soften” its tone, by substituting\nprovisions requiring Epstein to make his “best efforts” for language that appeared to dictate certain\nactions to the state. In so doing, houever, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,\nmaking it difficult later to declare Epstein in breach when he failed to comply.\n\nOPR found no indication that when deciding to resolve the federal prosecution through a\nmechanism that relied completely on state action, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages\nof having Epstein plead guilty in the state court system, a system in which none of the subjects had\npracticed and with which they were unfamiliar. Villafafia <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that there were “a lot of ways\nto manipulate state sentences,” and she told OPR that she was concerned from the outset of\nnegotiations about entering into the NPA, because by sending the case back to the state the USAO\nwas “giving up all control over what was going on.” Villafafia also told OPR that defense counsel\n“had a lot of experience with the state system. We did not.” Epstein’s ability to obtain work\nrelease, a provision directly contrary to the USAO’s intent with respect to Epstein’s sentence, is a\nclear example of the problem faced by the prosecutors when trying to craft a plea that depended\non a judicial system with which they were unfamiliar and over which they had no control.\nAlthough the issue of gain time was considered and addressed in the NPA, none of the subject\natorneys negotiating the NPA realized until after the NPA was signed that Epstein might be\neligible for work release. Acosta, in particular, told OPR that “if it was typical to provide that kind\nof work release in these cases, that would have been news to me.” Because work release was not\nanticipated, the NPA did not specifically address it, and the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein\nfrom applying for admission to the program.\n\n249 The Petite policy only applies to the Department of Justice and federal prosecutions. It does not prevent state\nauthorities from pursuing state charges after a federal prosecution. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols and State v.\nNichols (dual prosecution for acts commited in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building). Houever, in\npractice and to use their resources most efficiently, state authorities often choose not to pursue state charges if the\nfederal prosecution results in a conviction.\nl73\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7.

As OPR has set forth\nin substantial detail in this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the\nprosecutors sought to benefit Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result can more\nappropriately be tied to Acosta’s misplaced concerns about interfering with a traditionally state\ncrime and intruding on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to abandon the path that he had\nset, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end the negotiations and even though Acosta\nhimself had learned that the state authorities may not have been a reliable partner.\n\nMany of the problems that developed might have been avoided had Acosta engaged in\ngreater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The contemporaneous records\nrevealed problems with communication and coordination among the five key participants. Acosta\nwas involved to a greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a typical case. Lourie\ntold OPR that it was “unusual to have a U.S. Atorney get involved with this level of detail.”\nMenchel told OPR, “I knou we would have spoken about this case a lot, okay? And I’m sure with\nJeff as well, and there were conversations -- a meeting that I had with Marie and Andy as well.”\nLourie similarly told OPR:\n\nWell, ... he would have been talking to Jeff and Mat, talking to me\nto the extent that he did, he would have been looking at the Pros\nMemo and... the guidance from CEOS, he would have been\nreading the defense atorney’s leters, maybe talking to the State\nAtorney, I don’t knou, just . . . all these different sources of\ninformation he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you\nknou, that he was, he was reading everything.

Lourie normally would have signed off on the prosecution\nmemorandum on his oun, but as he told OPR, he <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that the case was going to go through\nthe front office “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” Yet, although\nAcosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as\noverseeing the investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR observed that as a\nconsequence, management of the case suffered from both an absence of ounership of the\ninvestigation and failures in communication that affected critical decisions.\n\nOn occasion, Villafafia included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information upon\nwhich Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta had made\ntraveled through multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,\nanalytical prosecution memorandum, but it is not clear that Acosta read it and instead may have\nrelied on conversations primarily with Menchel and later with Sloman after Menchel’s departure.\nDespite these discussions, though, it is not clear that Acosta was aware of certain information, such\nas Oosterban’s strong opinion from the outset in favor of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s\nconcerns and objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta interpreted the state\nindictment on only one charge as a sign that the case was weak evidentially, but it is not clear that\nwhen making his decision to resolve the mater though a state-based plea, he knew the extent to\n\nl83\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2322l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023225.tif": "from Villafafia and others, but given the highly unusual procedure being considered, his decision\nshould have been made only after a full consideration of all of the possible ramifications and\nconsequences of pushing the mater into the state court system, with which neither Villafafia nor\nthe other subjects had experience, along with consideration of the legal and evidentiary issues and\npossible means of overcoming those issues. OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.”\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in combination, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023307.tif": "B. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That Victims\nIdentified in the Federal Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea\nHearing\n\nAlthough Acosta (or the USAO) was not required by law or policy to notify victims of the\nstate’s plea hearing, he also was not prohibited by law or policy from notifying the victims that\nthe federal investigation had been resolved through an agreement that included pleas to state\ncharges. As the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy to\ninterfere in the state’s processes or to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney. His decision that the\nUSAO refrain from notifying victims about the state plea hearing and defer to the State Atorney’s\njudgment regarding whether and whom to notify was consistent with this view. Houever, OPR\nfound no evidence that Acosta’s decision to defer victim notification “to the discretion of the State\nAtorney” was ever actually communicated to any state authorities or that Acosta <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> that\nthe state, absent significant coordination with federal authorities, was unlikely to contact all of the\nvictims identified in the state and federal investigations or that the state would inform the victims\nthat it did notify that the state plea hearing was part of an agreement that resolved the federal\ninvestigation into their oun cases. ‘79\n\nEven taking into account Acosta’s views on principles of federalism and his reluctance to\ninterfere in state processes, Acosta should have <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span> the problems that would likely stem\nfrom passing the task of notifying victims to the State Atorney’s Office and made appropriate\nefforts to ensure that those problems were minimized. Appropriate notification would have\nincluded advising victims identified in the federal investigation that the USAO had declined to\nbring charges and that the mater was being handled by the State Atorney, and, at a minimum,\nprovided the victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted with\nthe State Atorney, or instructed Villafafia or others to do so, to ensure the state intended to make\nnotifications in a way that reached the most possible victims and that it had the information\nnecessary to accomplish the task. Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility for victim notification\nentirely to the State Atorney’s discretion without providing that office with the names of\nindividuals the USAO believed were victims and, apparently, without even informing the state\nprosecutors that he was deferring to them to make the notifications, if they chose to do so.\n\nEpstein was required by the NPA to plead to only two state charges, and even assuming\nthat each charge was premised on a crime against a different victim, and the solicitation charge\ninvolved three separate victims, there were thus only at most four victims of the charged state\noffenses. Without at least inquiring into the state’s intentions, Acosta had no way of determining\nwhether the state intended to notify more than those few victims. Moreover, the federal\ninvestigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had not been identified by\ninform the victim and to the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation.” See 42 U.S.C. §§ lo6o7(c)(l)(B)\nand (c)(3)(A).\n423 Through counsel, Acosta argued that OPR’s criticism of him for “electing to ‘defer’ the notification\nobligation to the state” was inappropriate and “a non sequitur” because “where no federal notification obligation\nexists, it cannot be deferred.” OPR’s criticism, as explained further belou, is not with the decision itself, but rather\nwith the fact that although Acosta intended for the federal victims to be notified of the state plea hearing, and believed\nthat they should receive such notification, he nonetheless left responsibility for such notification to the state without\nensuring that it had the information needed to do so and without determining the state’s intended course of action.\n\n269\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023322.tif": "OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\nNevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe <span class=\"highlight\">recognized</span>, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23322", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023401.tif": "medical record note reflected that, on this same date, Epstein was provided with his personally-ouned\nmedical device.

One example arose out of a need of the Jewish\ncommunity at Harvard to have a new Hillel Center built to foster Jewish social and\nreligious life at the university. The fundraising campaign was having difficulties when\nHenry Rosovsky, then Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, decided to approach\nJeffrey. Rosovsky wrote:\n\n° At this point I approached Jeffrey and suggested that a $2 million gift\nwould allou him to have his name on the building. It seemed to me a\ntempting proposition. To get your name on a Harvard building is a rarity\nand the cause was worthy.
