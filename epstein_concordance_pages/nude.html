Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Berman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defendant’s Motion for\nPretrial Release (the “Release Motion’), dated July ll, 2ol9 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its\nMemorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submited to Magistrate Judge\nPitman on July 8, 2ol9, which is atached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for\nyears. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of\nminors, including girls as young as l4 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a\nregistered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend,\ndespite unsuccessfully atempting to have that classification louered. And any doubt that the\ndefendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered\nhundreds or thousands of <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhatan\nmansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime\ninvolving a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated\ntestimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to\nprison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which\nremain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation\nof witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports\nabout his conduct reemerged. And he continues to shou a shocking lack of understanding of the\ngravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and\ncasual disparagement of victims in his arguments.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges,\nand the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions\nthat are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo329", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000330.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> or partially <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000331.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 3of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag. Tr.” refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2ol9;\n“T). Tr.” refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2ol9.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo33l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

(“It is contrary to underlying principles of\ndetention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately\naccountable to the government, even if carefully selected.”).\n\nIf the defendant’s appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,\nthe defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that\neffectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9.

Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-<span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000344.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 2oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 2\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. Overview\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed\nindictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors,\nin violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from\na years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2oo2, the\ndefendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he\npaid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.\n\nHe undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in\nManhatan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the\n“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in\nsimilar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which\nwould be performed <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> or partially <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and\nwould typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with\nvictims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate\nencounter.\n\nMoreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional\ngirls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying\nthese victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this\nfashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations\nincluding New York and Palm Beach.\n\nThe defendant’s victims were as young as l4 years old when he abused them. Many of his\nvictims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant\nintentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his\nvictims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused\nthem.\n\nIn creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant\nworked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors\nby, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the\ndefendant, both in New York and in Florida.\n\nB. The Defendant\n\nJeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant\nand through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his\nrampant abuse of underage girls.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000348.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page6oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 6\nMultiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information\nagainst the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances,\nby other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as\nfurther detailed belou, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the\ndefendant’s arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> and partially-<span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>\nyoung women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials,\nsuch as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant’s residence that include\nnames and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and\nhis agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply,\nall of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually\nabused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be\ndevastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention.\nFinally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant’s previous non-\nprosecution agreement (“NPA”) with a different federal district pose any impediment to his\nconviction. Asan initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\ndate of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v.\nChief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because Congress extended the statute\nof limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still\nrunning, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same).\nMoreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New\nYork was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL\ninvestigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude\nprosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well setled in the Second Circuit\nthat “a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind\nanother.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l (2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds\nonly the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it\naffirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”) (citing United States\nv. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the\nagreement purports to bind “the Government.” See Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672. This analysis\nsimilarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou, 688 F. Supp. 85l,\n854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement\nto the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States\nAtorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit,\nwhich presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can\naffirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.”) (citing Annabi,\n77l F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely\nthe presumptions and the § 3l42(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be\ndetained.”’).\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000351.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page9oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\nharassed both [redacted] in connection to this atempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process\nall in violation of l8 USC l5l2(d)(l).”> Doe v.

It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\n<span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> or partially-<span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 348\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

In addition to strong legal defenses Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was\nexceptional. It was clear that given the wording of Mr. Gou’s statement, proof of falsity of one\nor more of Giuffre’s claims would be enough to defeat the civil action. Very quickly there were\nmany provable “obvious lies.” A few examples:\n\ne Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parents with her\nfiance long before meeting Epstein or Ms. Maxwell and held a number of jobs in 2ool\nand 2oo2.\n\ne Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2ooo when she was l7, not l5.\n(This falsity was important to Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)\n\ne Palm Beach Police investigation revealed no evidence that Ms. Maxwell was involved in\nsexual abuse of minors, sexual trafficking or production or possession of child\npornography.\n\ne No <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photograph of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’s home.\n\ne Giuffre’s tales about foreign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.\n\ne All ofthe famous people Giuffre claimed to have been sexually trafficked to denied these\nclaims, which were completely implausible.\n\nImportantly, Giuffre post-dates the allegations contained in the superseding indictment\n(“Indictment”) by three years. By her claims, and admissions, she did not meet Epstein until\n2ooo, long after the accusers named in the Indictment. Her strong connection with these accusers\ndeveloped through her lawyers who likely represent at least two of the accusers and some of the\nwitnesses.\n\nVirtually every issue in the defamation action was contested. A review of the docket,\nunfortunately, reflects over one-thousand entries. The parties disagreed about the scope and\nmeaning of virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including those related to Ms.\nMaxwell’s depositions.

The same overt acts,\nincluding the allegations that form the basis for jurisdiction in SDNY over the crimes charged in\nCounts Five and Six, were presented to both grand juries.

And it was Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell, who\nprovided lingerie and other gifts to Accuser-4 and sent FedEx packages to her residence. (/d. at\n28:l9-29:lo).

This is entirely consistent with the language of the\nNPA, PY and not Ms. Maxwell, as one of the four named “potential co-\nconspirators.” (Ex. B at 5 of 7). In fact, the USAO-SDFL conceded that it never found “any\nspecific evidence against” Ms. Maxwell related to the subject of their investigation. (See Ex. A,\nOPR Report at l67 (internal quotations omited)).\n\nHence, it would not only be impermissible under the NPA to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for\nthe offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment because they were “the subject\nof” the Florida Investigation and “the related grand jury investigation.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 7). It would\nalso be entirely unjust to base a prosecution in this District on the same offenses related to the\nsame accuser who never mentioned Ms. Maxwell—and instead implicated a vben\nshe first reported the allegations that form the basis of Counts Five and Six over thirteen years\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004292.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document293 Filed o5/25/2l Page 27 of 32\ntime period from 2ool-2oo4. The counts do not specify, houever, the dates that any of this\nalleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment does not specify when Ms. Maxwell\n“interacted” with Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex acts with Epstein” or\n“enticed” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with Epstein.” (S2 Indictment J\n9d, 25a, 25b). Nor does the S2 Indictment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid Accuser-4\nor sent her gifts or called her to schedule massage appointments. (Id. ff 9d, 25c, 25d). A Bill of\nParticulars for Counts Five and Six is therefore necessary and appropriate. See Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d at 575 (Bill of Particulars warranted where “[t]he relevance of key events was shrouded in\nmystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial”). /d. at 575.\n\nFurthermore, as discussed above, Ms. Maxwell has already credibly asserted that her\nprosecution on Counts Five and Six is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. (See Section II\nsupra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is\napparent from the grand jury testimony of Special Agen i — that the offenses charged\nin Counts Five and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDFL grand jury.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons and the reasons already discussed in our previous motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars, the Court should order the government to file a Bill of Particulars\nidentifying the follouing information related to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment:\n\n(l) The dates when Ms. Maxwell allegedly met and/or interacted with\n\nAccuser-4.

After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government.

When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004337.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 4o of 349\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4337", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. . [or] if that visual depiction\nwas produced or transmited using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or\ntransported in or affecting interstate or .. . commerce by any means, including by\ncomputer.\nl76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o4 of 349\nthe federal investigation in exchange for a plea in state court to a charge that carried a two-year\nsentence. The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 69\nae once mentioned Ms. Maxwell.”> See 35o5-oo5.

Much of it concerns fixtures: the room’s size, its dark and reddish\nwallpaper and curtains, its built-in bookcase, and its wooden molding. Those cannot be removed\nfrom the room without a renovation—in some cases, a significant renovation.\n\nEven those items that are “movable” are consistent with Epstein’s longstanding practices,\nand therefore still probative. Jane did not testify to any art in the massage room, and the\nGovernment would not argue that the particular <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> artwork in the exhibits was present while\nJane was abused. But there is evidence of Epstein’s practice of displaying depictions of naked\nwomen in his homes from the mid-l99os through the mid-2ooos, through both Jane’s testimony\nand evidence of the search of his Palm Beach house. The artwork in Epstein’s home at the time\nof the search is a continuation of that practice and tends to make it make it more likely that Jane’s\ntestimony was accurate. That is all that is required to shou relevance.\n\nAt a more general level, this evidence is probative that Jane knew hou Epstein decorated\nhis New York massage room. It was dark, red, with curtains, a built-in bookcase, and a stereo\nsystem. It was in a house decorated with wood, wallpaper, and artwork shouing <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> women.\nThe jury will knou full well, and the defense will surely argue, that time has passed since the mid-\nl99os. But that argument goes to weight, not whether the evidence is relevant at all. A jury could\nreasonably conclude that it is no coincidence that these photos match Jane’s description—it is\nbecause Jane has been in this room.\n\nIf the Court remains concerned about the relevance of movable property, the Government\ncan offer photos that redact the artwork. But the photographs of the massage room are probative\n5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page6of9\nevidence on a material mater, and they should be admited.\n\nB. Other Photographs\n\nMany of the remaining photographs of Epstein’s house corroborate other testimony by\nJane. As with the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> pictures in the massage room, each of these photographs is consistent with\ntestimony about Epstein’s practices, so they are probative corroboration of that testimony.\n\nFirst, Jane testified that Epstein used vibrators and back massagers of sizes while abusing\nher. (ll/3o/2l Tr. at 3lo). Juan Alessi, whose testimony corroborated Jane, also testified that he\nfound two different kinds of vibrating back massagers after Epstein received massages, and that\nthose massagers were kept in Epstein’s bathroom in Palm Beach. (l2/o2/2l Tr. at 894-95).\n\nThe Government recovered two vibrating massagers in the bathroom of the New York\nhome adjacent to the massage room. The Government therefore seeks admission of two photos,\nGovernment Exhibits 9l8 and 92l, depicting those two devices:\n\n[Redacted]\nThe point of this evidence is not to shou that these vibrators are the particular vibrators used on\nJane. It is to shou that they are the type that were used on Jane, and corroborate Jane’s testimony\nby shouing that Epstein did, consistent with the modus operandi of the conspiracy from the mid-\nl99os through the early 2ooos, possess this sort of massager device.\n\nSecond, Jane testified that the home contained “creepy looking animals.” (ll/3o/2l Tr. at\n3 The Government could not elicit testimony from Jane about these photographs without\nsubstantially diminishing the probative force of the evidence. Before shouing the photographs to\nJane on the stand, the Government would surely need to shou her the photographs in advance.\nDoing so would permit an inference that Jane tailored her testimony about her memories of the\nmassage room to the photographs, thereby vitiating the photographs’ value as independent\ncorroboration.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo82l9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document523 Filed l2/o4/2l Page 8of9\nphotos of the defendant and Epstein with celebrities, and additional artwork depicting <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>\nwomen. The Government does not currently intend to offer exhibits depicting those photographs\nor artwork, but it does intend to elicit testimony from the law enforcement witness that the home\ncontained those items. That testimony is further corroboration of Jane’s general knouledge of\ncategories of decorations Epstein preferred, but it contains no suggestion that any particular exhibit\ncorroborates Jane’s testimony.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that the defense has not raised a Rule 4o3 prejudice\nargument, and for good reason. None of the evidence in this category is prejudicial to the defense.\nThere will be no suggestion that the defendant or Epstein possessed these particular items during\nthe time period of the conspiracy, and the defense is free to argue that the distance in time\nundermines the probative force of the evidence. But whether that probative force is significant (as\nthe Government suggests) or minimal (as the defense suggests), the defense is not prejudiced by\npictures of a massager, a stuffed tiger, or photos of structural features of Epstein’s home.\n\nIl. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, photographs from the 9oo series of Government Exhibits should\nbe admited.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo822l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page/7of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 7\n\nThe government atempts to marginalize this Court’s legitimate concern about highly\nmobile items. But the Court’s concern is well founded. Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8. But if that’s so, then there’s\nno probative value to the unauthenticated photographs, particular when, as the Court\nacknouledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence. TR l2/3/2o2l, p\nlo77:3.\n\nBecause the government has not authenticated the 2ol9 photos as accurate\nrepresentations of Mr. Epstein’s house in l994 or l995 or l996, they are irrelevant. But even if\nthey were relevant, this Court could still exclude them as unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3. They are misleading because, as McCormick recognizes, the government has\nnot shoun the lack of changed conditions. § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th\ned.).

In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking conspiracy who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. Geographic Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking conspiracy which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on interstate commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines. (Tr. 3o4l-42). As a result, the conspiracy in Count Three was focused on travel to\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9594", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 662 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 2l of 29\nwho was his employee. According to the record, there were several people employed by Epstein\nwho interacted with “Jane” and Annie Farmer and whom Ms. Maxwell supervised in her role as\nmanager of Epstein’s properties in the mid-late l99os — e.g., Juan Alessi in Palm Beach and\nvarious unnamed employees at Zorro Ranch. The record also reflects that Ms. Maxwell had\nsome role in coordinating payroll and expenses for Epstein pilots, Larry Visoski and David\nRodgers, who transported “Jane” on Epstein’s private planes. But these people had no\nknouledge of the criminal conduct and do not qualify as criminally responsible participants for\nthe purposes of the aggravating role enhancement.\n\nSimilarly, there is no evidence in the trial record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another\ncriminal participant in the offenses against Carolyn. Apart from Epstein, Sarah Kellen was the\nonly other person identified in the trial record as a criminal participant in the offenses against\nCarolyn. Among other things, Carolyn testified that Sarah Kellen scheduled massage\nappointments for her and took <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> pictures of her at the Palm Beach residence on one occasion.\n(Tr. l527-28; l538-39). The record is clear, houever, that Ms. Maxwell did not supervise Sarah\nKellen. Rather, Kellen was hired by Epstein as his assistant to replace Ms. Maxwell and take\nover responsibility for scheduling massage appointments and other property management tasks at\na time when Ms. Maxwell was moving on from Epstein and was no longer actively managing the\nday-to-day affairs of his residences.\n\nFor example, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was hired sometime between 2ooo-\n2oo2 to be Epstein’s assistant and that she, and not Sarah Kellen, was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant\nfrom when she was hired in l996 up through the end of her employment in 2oo2. (Tr. 2332-33,\n2376-77).° Espinosa further testified that in the last two years of her employment (2ooo-2oo2),\n\n8 Larry Visoski initially testified that he thought Sarah Kellen was Ms. Maxwell’s assistant.

At some point during each massage, Epstein rolled over and\nbegan masturbating himself. (/d.). Epstein then directed Carolyn to touch his nipples and he\ntouched Carolyn’s breasts and butocks. (/d.). On one occasion, Epstein atempted to touch\nCarolyn’s vagina with a vibrator, but Carolyn pulled away, so he stopped. (/d.). On two occasions,\nEpstein brought other females into the room with Carolyn, who engaged Carolyn in oral sex, and\non one occasion Epstein raped Carolyn by penetrating her vagina with his penis. (PSR { 72).\nEvery massage ended with Epstein ejaculating. (PSR 4 64).\n\nThe defendant personally scheduled Carolyn’s massages for approximately the first year\nor two, when Carolyn was between the ages of l4 and l5. (PSR § 66). When the defendant\nscheduled Carolyn for an appointment, she sometimes sent a car to pick Carolyn up. (/d.). At the\ntime, Carolyn was l4 or l5 years old and did not have a license. (/d.). Indeed, the defendant knew\nCarolyn’s age and much of her background because she had multiple conversations with Carolyn\nabout Carolyn’s life. (PSR 4 67). During these conversations, Carolyn revealed that she had\npreviously been sexually abused by a relative, that her parents were separated, and that her mother\nstruggled with addiction. (/d.). The defendant invited Carolyn to travel with the defendant and\nEpstein, but Carolyn explained that because she was only l4 years old, she would not be able to\nget permission to travel. (PSR 4 68). Carolyn was paid several hundred dollars in one-hundred-\ndollar bills after each massage. (PSR § 65). Usually, the money was laid out on the table or by\nthe sink in the bathroom, but the defendant personally paid Carolyn after a few massages. (/d.).\n\nThe defendant saw Carolyn fully <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> in the massage room on approximately three\noccasions. (PSR 4 69). This happened when Carolyn had already undressed in preparation for the\nmassage but before Epstein had come into the room. (/d.). One particular instance stands out in\nCarolyn’s mind. (/d.).

(/d.). The defendant told Carolyn\nthat she had a nice body and touched Carolyn’s breasts. (/d.).\n\nAt some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had any young friends she could bring for\nmassages. (PSR § 7l). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to massage Epstein, including\nmultiple minors. (/d.). When Carolyn brought girls to massage Epstein, both the girl and Carolyn\nwould be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). During those massages, Epstein masturbated and\ntouched Carolyn’s and her friend’s breasts and butocks. (/d.).\n\n6. Sexual Abuse of Melissa\n\nOne of the minor girls Carolyn brought to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein was\nnamed Melissa. (PSR { 8o). Melissa was just l6 years old when she went with Carolyn to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (/d.). Melissa went to Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein\nwith massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of l8. (/d.). When Melissa and\nCarolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then\nreturned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). An entry entitled ‘“Melissa’s cell (Carolyn’s\nfriend),” as well as multiple entries with Carolyn’s full name and an entry entitled “Virginia\n(parents)” were listed in the defendant and Epstein’s black address book under the heading\n“Massage — Florida.” U/d.; PSR 9.57). Thus, as a direct result of the pyramid scheme that began\nwith Virginia and continued with Carolyn, Melissa suffered repeated sexual abuse.\n\nII. The Pre-Sentence Report and Sentencing Guidelines\n\nThe United States Probation Office, in its Pre-Sentence Investigation Report, recommends\na sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. In making that recommendation, the Probation Office\ncharacterized the defendant’s offense conduct as “heinous and predatory in nature.” (PSR at 67).\nRegarding the defendant’s role, the Probation Office emphasized that “[t]he gravity of Maxwell’s\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo55l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page 28 of 55\ndefendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 4o3 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force\nhere. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knouing participants—which, as\ndiscussed belou, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of\nunknouing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the\nenhancement under U.S.S.G. §3Bl.l.\n\nHere, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned\nmany years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was\nresponsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual\nabuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being\nuncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knouing participants who took the lead in\nidentifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who\nhandled the responsibilities of scheduling sexualized massages and took <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photographs of\nCarolyn (PSR § 66; Tr. l554-55), constituted a third knouing participant, which number the\nCircuit has found sufficient, together with additionally necessary unknouing participants, to be\nsufficient for the enhancement. See Archer, 67l F.3d at l66.\n\nBeyond those three knouing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor\ngirls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a\ncrucial role in the scheme’s later pyramid phase. Juan Alessi provided an essential role\ntransporting Jane and Virginia to see Epstein, as well as scheduling appointments for massages,\ncleaning up the massage room after Epstein received sexualized massages, and puting away sex\ntoys in the defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received sexualized massages. (PSR 9] 24, 57; Tr.\n836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring\nthat minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo563", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Page 2l of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> and half-<span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages.

In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021213.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document O39 3536o38, Page4l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 39 of 348\nand some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed ina school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.

Besides his\nNew York City mansion, Epstein also had an estate in Palm Beach, maintained a ranch in New\nMexico, had a luxury apartment in Paris, and ouned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nIn denying him bail earlier this month, the judge said\nthat Epstein posed a “significant” danger to the\ncommunity and agreed with prosecutors that he was\na serious flight risk.\n:\nhitps:/Avwaw.washIngtonexaminer.com/news/barr-announces-doj-Inspector-general_investigation-intc-epstein-death a3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o54", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022170.jpg": "SOD-NY-3o2757l\n\nType(s}:lB, lD, lE\n\nItem # Type Description\n\nl8l46 Digital (U} ONE CELLOPHANE containing: NYCO32395 - One (l)DVD-R containing image log files and FTK reports for system information on selected items.\n\nlBl45 Digital (U} Red Rope Containing;NYCO3239l - Three (3} LTO 6 tape cartridges containing an Arcserve backup of all digital evidence from Submission ID 2l94o7.\n\nlBl44 Digital (U} Red Rope Containing;NYCo32392 - Two(2) LTO 6 tape cartridges containing an Arcserve backup of all digital evidence from Submission ID 2l5974.\n\nlBl43 Digital (U} one (l} CD labelled \"girl pics <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> book 4\"\n\nlBl42 Digital (U} ONE REDROPE CONTAINING: (l) Envelope containing l VHS tape, 2 cassete tapes & 4 micro cassete tapes\n\nlBl4l Digital (U} ONE REDROPE CONTAINING: (l} Envelope containing 4 CD's\n\nlBl4o General (U} (2} Bankers box containing various EPSTEIN related case materials\n\nlBl39 General (U} ONE BOX CONTAINING: One pair of black women's couboy boots, size 8\n\nlBl38 General (U} ONE CELLOPHANE containing: Disk containing images of Matchmaker shred reconstruction\n\nlBl37 General (U} ONE CELLOPHANE CONTAINING: (l} un-framed photo.\n\nlBl36 Digital (U//FOUO) ONE RED ROPE containing: Highly confidential responsive material to include <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> and semi <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> images and videos from digital evidence items processed by CART.\n\nlBl35 General (U} Box containing Ten yearbooks collected by FBI West Palm Beach Resident Agency\n\nlBl34 General (U} One (l} peach massage table.\n\nlBl33 General (U} One (l} green massage table (PBPDO5-lo24}.\n\nlBl32 General (U} One (l} beige massage table.\n\nlBl3l General (U} One (l} broun massage table.\n\nlBl3o General (U} One flat box containing one (l} large framed photo.\n\nlBl29 General (U} One box containing four (4) framed photos.\n\nlBl28 General (U} One box containing twelve (l2) framed photos.\n\nlBl27 General (U} One box containing five (5} framed photos\n\nlBl26 General (U} One red rope containing: LSJ logbook\n\nlBl25 General (U} One red rope containing:Daily Vessel Trip logs Feb 2, 2ol7 - Feb l6, 2ol7\n\nlBl24 Digital (U) HP Touer S/N: CNV742l3M3 Model: 57o-po56\n\nlBl23 Digital (U} Lenovo Touer S/N: l833o6G2UMJXEKGX\n\nlBl22 Digital (U} Lenovo Touer S/N: MJO7YG6U Machine type: 9oJo\n\nlBl2l Digital (U} Mac DesktopS/N: W89524CZSPJ model Al3l2\n\nlBl2o Digital (U) HP TouerS/N: CNV7l6oo4Y Model #: 26o-aolo\n\nlBll9 Digital (U} HP Desktop TouerS/N: CNV7l6oo5oModel #: 26o-aolo\n\nlBll8 Digital (U} Silver Mac desktop\n\nlBll7 Digital (U) 6 Bay with l46GB drivesS/N: MXQ824AlR\n\nlBll6 Digital (U} One box containing Panasonic KX-TDElooS/N: KX-TDAOlo49LCCDoo5398\n\nlBll5 Digital (U} HP server with (4} 5oo GB drivesS/N: MXQ322ol87\n\nlBll4 General (U} Blue prints\n\nlBll3 General (U} One cellophane containing:Boat trip log & employee lists\n\nlBll2 Digital (U) Unifi serverMacID: l735K788A2o463234-8uuU9FF CCID: SWX-UASPRO\n\nlBll Digital (U) Unifi videoM/N: UVC-NVR-2TBMaclD: l829FB4FBE426EA9o\n\nlBllo General (U} One cellophane containing:Paper with passwords on both sides\n\nlBlo9 Digital (U) Unifi Cloud keyM/N: UN-CKFCCID: SWX-UCCKIC 6545A-UCCKMac ID: l843KB4FBE4D3oC69-dcRgm9\n\nlBlo8 Digital (U} CELLOPHANE containing Olympus Digital Voice Recorder\n\nlBlo7 Digital (U} Silver Mac desktopModel #: Al3llS/N: W8o4736DDAS\n\nlBlo6 Digital (U} Dell Inspiron touer with pouer cordReg Model: DI9MQCHFA335\n\nlBlo5 General (U} One red rope containing:LSJ & GSJ Boat Log 2ol9\n\nlBlo4 General (U} Box containing Shredded paper\n\nlBlo3 Digital (U} ONE CELLOPHANE CONTAINING;

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023051.jpg": "and some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.jpg": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”®’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\nm6 In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\nad Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.jpg": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that ““we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n255 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer equipment and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00028902.jpg": "wesc THE PALM BEACH POST * WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 2oo6 55\nPolice key h on h airp¢ ifted through trash\n-Folice kept watch on home, airport, sifted through tras\nsaid.

Under Epstein’s\nplan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence\nor soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring\none or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally\nsought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who\nwould be enticed by the money being offered - generally $2oo to $3oo per “massage” session - and\nwho were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of\nimproper sa were made. This was an important element of Epstein’s plan.\n\nl3. Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular patern and method. Upon arrival at\nEpstein’s mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant,\nwho gathered the girl’s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen\nwould then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition\nto other furnishings.

It is our hope\nthat in light of the recent developments in this case which we have set forth in our leter\nof June 5, 2oo6, our meetings, and herein, in particular the fact that there is no sex\nalleged, this case can be disposed of with, at most, an informal agreement, or more\nappropriately, no charges being filed at all.\nAs you knou, it was only at the June l, 2oo6 meeting, after eight months of\ninvestigation, that you and I both learned, for the very first time, and I believe to our\ncollective disbelief, that the allegation of the girl did not raise the slightest hint of actual\nsex. Up until that point, we had all been laboring under the assumption this girl had\nalleged multiple sexual encounters with my client.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nI. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the recipient of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o49", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023051.tif": "and some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him\nmassages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.\n\nThrough their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.\nSome girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The\nnature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they\nmassaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Victims stated\nthat during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched\nthem during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or\nthrough their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and\nsome stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more\noften alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an\nEpstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at\nEpstein’s direction.’\n\nAlthough the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent\nin describing a general patern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to\nthe information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled\nup to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment\nwhile Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl\narrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and\nbathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When\nthe assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a touel. After removing his\nclothing, Epstein lay face doun and <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her\nclothing, and then explained to her hou he wished her to perform the massage. During the\nmassage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.\nWhen Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $2oo for the\nmassage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact\nher in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls\ninterested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to\nperform a massage, each girl would receive $2oo. Several of the victims acknouledged to the\nPBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.\n\nThe evidence regarding Epstein’s knouledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who\nrecruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were\nover l8 years old. Houever, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.\nPolice were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flouers to her at her high school\nafter she performed in a school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some\nof the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.\n\nEpstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local\ncriminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2oo5, the PBPD,\nwith the assistance of the State Atorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s\nresidence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 2o, 2oo5, to execute the warrant,\n7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than\nthis female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o5l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023084.tif": "Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.” Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\nR In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafania’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it?s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer equipment until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span> by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”®’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\n%6 In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\n7 Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o98", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023214.tif": "search warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of mterstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer equipment. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the <span class=\"highlight\">nude</span>. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.””» Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer equipment.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\nequipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer equipment; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence.
