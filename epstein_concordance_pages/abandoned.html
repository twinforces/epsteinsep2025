Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span>\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . .

The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal\nFavorable to Epstein over Breakfast with Defense Counsel\n\nOPR separately considered the circumstances of one specific meeting that has been the\nsubject of media atention and public criticism. The Miami Herald’s November 2ol8 reporting on\nthe Epstein investigation opened with an account of the October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting that\ndefense counsel Jay Lefkouitz arranged to have with Acosta at the West Palm Beach Marriot\nhotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal was struck” at the meeting to allou Epstein\nto serve “just l3 months” in the county jail in exchange for the shutering of the federal\ninvestigation, and Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full extent of Epstein’s crimes from the\nvictims and the public.7*4 Although public criticism of the meeting has focused on the fact that\nthe meeting occurred in a hotel far from Acosta’s Miami office, the evidence shous that Acosta\ntraveled to West Palm Beach on October ll for a press event and stayed overnight at the hotel,\nnear the USAO’s West Palm Beach office, because at midday on October l2 he was to speak at\nthe Palm Beach County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence\nsurrounding the breakfast meeting, including contemporaneous email communications and witness\naccounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant\nconcessions relating to it, during or as a result of the October breakfast meeting.\n\nEpstein and his atorneys signed the NPA on September 24, 2oo7—more than two weeks\nbefore the October l2 breakfast meeting. The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims.

Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act\nbecause it found the prior statute of limitations was “‘inadequate in many cases.” H.R. Conf.\nRep. No. lo8-63, at 54 (2oo3). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not\nbe prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as\nthe perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.” /d.\n\nMaxwell makes no argument based on the statute’s text. Instead, she contends that\nbecause the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its\nfinal form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past\nconduct. Houever, the legislative history makes clear that Congress <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> the retroactivity\nprovision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The\nSupreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex\nPost Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations\ndoes not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 6o7, 632-33 (2oo3). Senator Leahy, who co-\nsponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a commitee report that the proposed\nretroactivity provision was “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the\ngovernment’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” l49 Cong. Rec.\n$5l37, 85l47 (Apr. lo, 2oo3) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision\nshortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shous only\nthat Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including\npast conduct—like Maxwell’s—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired.\n\nBoth the text and history of the PROTECT Act’s amendment to § 3283 reflect that it\napplies Maxwell’s conduct charged in the Sl superseding indictment. The Court could stop here.\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3689", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7 of 2o\nthat Giuffre possessed in February and March 2ol6. Under Judge Sweet’s pre-deposition order,\nGiuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2ol6 deposition.\nGiuffre’s failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet’s order, is compelling evidence\nthat Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when\ndeposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an\nevidentiary hearing is appropriate.\n\nThe government’s second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth Amendment right.\nResp. at loo. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knouingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745\nF.3d l5, 23 (2d Cir. 2ol4). And “‘knouing’ means with full awareness of the nature of the right\nbeing <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> and the consequences of abandoning it.” /d.\n\nHere, Maxwell did not knouingly waive her Fifth Amendment right. She declined to\ninvoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the Protective Order, and on the\nunderstanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it\nturned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies\nSchiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material\nJudge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right\nand avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her.\n\nIt is for this reason that the government fails in its atempt to distinguish United States v.\nOshatz, 7oo F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. l988). Resp. at lo2. The government says that the logic of\nOshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here,\nMaxwell was deposed “over two years before the Government opened its investigation.” Resp. at\nloo; id. at lo2 (noting that the defendant in Oshaiz “had already been indicted at the time of his\ndeposition in a civil case for almost seven months’’).

Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 3\nsearches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\nfinancial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\n<span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.\nKentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 69o (l986) (“Whether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3855", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Page9ofl3\nThe Hon.

Although investigation will vary depending on the\n\ncircumstances, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,\n\nafter consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of\n\nthe criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the\n\npossession of the prosecution, law enforcement authorities, and others, as well as\n\nindependent investigation. Counsel’s investigation should also include evaluation\n\nof the prosecution’s evidence (including possible re-testing or re-evaluation of\n\nphysical, forensic, and expert evidence) and consideration of inconsistencies,\n\npotential avenues of impeachment of prosecution witnesses, and other possible\nsuspects and alternative theories that the evidence may raise.\nId. at (c).\n\nMost significantly, because the government expressly represented in their prior\ncommunications to the Court and to counsel that they would not be seeking to introduce\nevidence from the 2ooos (apart from the perjury counts), counsel for Ms. Maxwell has already\nundertaken a review of the discovery focused on the l99os and the allegations in the Sl\nindictment. Nou that the government has completely <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> that position and extended the\nconspiracy to include a time frame up to 2oo4, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel must re-review the\ndiscovery she has already painstakingly reviewed to comb for evidence related to the new time\nperiod.\n\nE. Continuing problems with the government’s evidence production require\n\nadditional time\n\nIn addition to the “new” 2o,ooo pages of exculpatory evidence not yet provided to Ms.\nMaxwell, defense counsel and Ms. Maxwell have encountered significant obstacles in the review\nof the discovery produced prior to April l3\".

But\nthese offenses are the exact same offenses that were the subject of the Florida Investigation and\nresolved by the NPA, which covers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” including Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nThe Court ruled unequivocally that the NPA covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell\nin offenses commited by Epstein from 2ool to 2oo7, other offenses that were the subject of the\nFBI and U.S. Atorney’s Office investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand\njury investigation.” (Dkt. 2o7 at 7). Yet Counts Five and Six fall squarely within all three\ncategories of offenses for which the NPA immunizes Ms. Maxwell:\n\ne The allegations of Accuser-4 fall within the 2ool-2oo7 timeframe and the new\n\ncounts charge violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a statute specifically\nenumerated in the NPA.\n\ne The Palm Beach FBI and the USAO-SDFL thoroughly investigated Accuser-\n\n4’s allegations as part of the Florida Investigation.\n\ne Accuser-4’s allegations were presented to the grand jury in that District and\nformed the basis for a conspiracy charge and a sex trafficking charge in a\nproposed 6o-count federal indictment of Epstein that was dropped pursuant to\nthe terms of the NPA.\n\nBecause Counts Five and Six are based on the exact same evidence investigated and presented to\nthe SDFL grand jury in 2oo8, and are the exact same crimes included in the proposed SDFL\nindictment against Epstein later <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> pursuant to the NPA, the government cannot nou\ncharge Ms. Maxwell with these offenses.\n\nFurther, the NPA binds the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York (““USAO-SDNY’”) as to the newly-indicted counts. We understand that the Court\npreviously ruled that under United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir. l985) and its progeny,\nthe language and drafting history of the NPA does not “affirmatively appear” to bind this District\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004284.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 _ Filed o5/25/2l Page l9 of 32\nagreement bind the Western District of Pennsylvania and bar it from charging the same offenses\nin a subsequent prosecution? The Court held that it did:\n\nWe hold, therefore, that when a United States Atorney negotiates\n\nand contracts on behalf of “the United States” or “the\n\nGovernment” in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that atorney\n\nspeaks for and binds all of his or her fellou United States\n\nAtorneys with respect to those same crimes and those same\n\ndefendants.\nId. at 55o (emphasis added); see also United States v.

Harvey, 79l F.2d 294, 3o3 (4th Cir. l986) (“It is the Government at large—not\nJust specific United States Atorneys or United States ‘Districts’—that is bound by plea\nagreements negotiated by agents of Government.”).\n\nThis case presents the exact set of circumstances carved out by Annabi and directly\naddressed in Gebbie. Here, the co-conspirator provision of the NPA provides that if Epstein\nabides by the terms of the agreement, “the United States” will not institute any criminal charges\n“against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” which immunizes Ms. Maxwell for the\noffenses covered by the NPA. (Ex. B at 5 of 7; see also Dkt. 2o7 at 7). As set forth above,\nCounts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are based on the same alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-4 from 2ool-2oo4 that was presented to the SDFL grand jury and formed the basis for\nseveral overt acts of a conspiracy charge and a substantive sex trafficking offense against Epstein\nin the proposed SDFL indictment. The prosecution of those offenses was <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> as part of\nthe bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4\nbenefited.

Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span>\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . .

The government’s atempt to authenticate Exhibit 52 through Ms. Maxwell’s\ntestimony about something else entirely fails.\n\nThe flaws in the government’s argument don’t end with these two problems, though each\nproblem itself is dispositive of the government’s request. The government’s leter focuses\nexclusively on the authentication question. The government does not address the business records\nexception or even atempt to justify the admission of Exhibit 52 despite it being hearsay.\n\nThe government also conveniently ignores all it said before about why Exhibit 52 was\nrelevant and hou it would be admited and used as evidence. The government first said Exhibit\n52 was Ms. Maxwell’s book. That was the entire premise of the government’s November l2\nleter and its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion in limine. But no witness has testified that it\nwas Ms. Maxwell’s book, and the government has <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> that argument.!\n\nThe government next said it would call Employee-l as a witness to authenticate the\nexhibit and lay the foundation for its admission and, in turn, to testify that Exhibit 52 belonged to\nMs. Maxwell. But no more. The government’s decision not to call Employee-l confirms what\nMs. Maxwell has been saying all along: Exhibit 52 did not belong to her, and Employee-l was\nnever going to testify that it did.\n\nFinally, it would be exceedingly unfair were the government to admit Exhibit 52 at this\nlate stage in its case, having nou <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> its earlier arguments for admissibility and relevance.\nAs this Court recognized earlier today, Mr. Alessi is done testifying, and Ms. Maxwell cannot be\n\n' We knou the government has <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> this argument because it relies on Ms.\nMaxwell’s deposition testimony as the basis for admiting Exhibit 52.

Three\ndifferent victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in\nEpstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information\noutlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the\nsame techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in\nsex acts. Each victim will describe hou the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions\nabout her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the\nuse of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe hou the\npresence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,\nthis is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially\ncorroborating each other.\n\n' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to\nmake on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.\nAfter receiving discovery, the defense nou appears to have <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> those arguments, at least\ninsofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020111.jpg": "CaSedeZot epQC33ouAUNt Bescutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Pagel d Ob l5\nas a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.*> The government’s case is not what it represented\nto the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.*\nIl.

The government ignores that, since the initial bail\nhearing, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submited a\ndetailed leter describing his commited relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years\nand the important role she has played, and continues to play, Po\n|| It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell’s closest friends and family, many of\nwhom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk,\nto support her bond with pledges of assets or leters of support. This information, which\nwas not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell’s\nstrong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail.\n\nRather than address the merits, the government atempts to dismiss the significance\nof Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial\nServices that she was in the process of geting a divorce and that her spouse did not step\nforward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing.

The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel.

Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA.

The signed NPA contained all of the key provisions\nresulting from the preceding weeks of negotiations between the parties, and despite a later\naddendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those\nkey provisions remained in place thereafter. Acosta told OPR that throughout the negotiations\nwith the defense, he sought three goals: (l) Epstein’s guilty plea in state court to an offense\nrequiring registration as a sexual offender; (2) a sentence of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism\nthrough which victims could obtain monetary damages from Epstein. As noted previously, the\nUSAO’s original plea offer in Menchel’s August 3, 2oo7 leter expressed a “non-negotiable”\ndemand that Epstein agree to a two-year term of imprisonment, and the final NPA required only\nan l8-month sentence, but the decision to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to l8\nmonths was made well before Acosta’s breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, required l8 months’ incarceration, sexual offender registration, and a\nmechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from Epstein, and OPR found that these\nterms were not <span class=\"highlight\">abandoned</span> or materially altered after the breakfast meeting.\n\nAt the time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz, two issues involving\nthe NPA were in dispute. Neither of those issues was ultimately resolved in a way that materially\nchanged the key provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change\nthe mechanism for appointing an atorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated\nrequest had prompted discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman sent the text of a\nproposed NPA addendum to Lefkouitz on October ll, 2oo7.7°° Although OPR found no decisive\n234 Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the\ndeal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n235 In his December l9, 2oo7, leter to defense atorney Sanchez, Acosta represented that he had proposed the\naddendum at the breakfast meeting, but it is clear the addendum was being developed before then.\nl6o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l98"};
