Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse.

The government’s motion seeks to unfairly capitalize on this Court’s\ndecision largely overruling Ms. Maxwell’s Daubert challenge to the government’s expert, Dr.\nLisa Rocchio. If the government gets its way, Dr. Rocchio will present the jury with a one-sided\nversion of events while Ms. Maxwell will be crippled in her ability to respond. This Court should\nnot permit the asymmetry the government hopes to create.\n\nThere is no dispute that Drs. Dietz and Loftus are supremely qualified in their respective\nareas of expertise. Atached as Exhibit l is the defense disclosure of the expert opinions of Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus. That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (transcript of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s construction of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case. To the extent the government contends these opinions don’t “fit,” that objection is flat-\nout wrong or at least premature, since the government hasn’t put any evidence on yet.

The government’s bold statement that there is no evidence that “occurrences, suggestion,\ninfluences or the like” happened to any witness is this case is pure bolstering that is belied by the\n35oo material. Dr. Loftus’s extensive experience, expertise, and proposed testimony is the right\n“fit” for this case. The Court should permit her expert testimony.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe government does not call into question Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s qualifications,\nnor does it meaningfully question the reliability of their opinions. Rather, the government claims\ntheir opinions invade the province of the jury or do not “fit” the case. A hearing is not necessary\nor appropriate to resolve the government’s arguments. And as explained above, these arguments\nfail on the merits.\n\nThis Court should deny the government’s motion.\n\nDated: November l2, 2o2l\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-oooo749l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l74 of 375\nl999 - 2oo3 Georgetoun University School of Medicine\nWashington, DC\nM.D. Degree\n2oo3 -2oo4 Internal Medicine Internship\nSinai Hospital of Baltimore/Johns Hopkins\nBaltimore, Maryland\n2oo4 -2oo7 Psychiatric Residency\nJohns Hopkins Hospital\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\nBaltimore, Maryland\n2oo7 — 2oo8 Fellou in Forensic Psychiatry\nCase Western Reserve University\nCleveland, Ohio\nMEDICAL LICENSE:\n2oo4 Maryland — D62746 - Inactive\n2oo7 Ohio — 89483 - Inactive\n2oo7 Florida —- ME99792\n2o2l New Mexico — FELMD2o2l-o63 (Federal Emergency MD)-Inactive\n2o2l -2o22 New Mexico — MD2o2l-o674\nCERTIFICATION:\n2oo8 Diplomate, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, #58286\n2oo9 with added qualifications for Forensic Psychiatry\n2oo9-2ol8 Certified Forensic Physician\nAmerican College of Forensic Examiners Institute\n2oll-2ol4 Diplomate, American Board of Forensic Medicine, #ll779\nAmerican College of Forensic Examiners Institute\n2ol5- 2ol8 Fellou, American College of Forensic Examiners Institute,\n#ll779\no7/l9/2ol5 — Diplomate, National Board of Physicians and Surgeons\no7/3l/2o23 for Psychiatry and Forensic Psychiatry, #ool999\no4/23/2ol8 Diplomate, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, #58286\nand Forensic Psychiatry, #l735, Maintenance of Certification\nADDITIONAL TRAINING:\n2oo6 Forensic Psychiatry Review Course\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7667", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 2l of l592o\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl qualifications?\n\n2 A.

Neither of these issues is relevant\nat trial, and both experts should be precluded.\n\nThe defendant has failed to provide adequate notice as to the four remaining experts.\nInstead of describing those experts’ opinions and the bases for them, as required by Rule l6, the\nnotice identifies topics on which the experts might testify. The Government is therefore not able\nto interpose a Daubert challenge at this time.! The Court should require the defense to provide\nsupplemental expert notice forthwith or preclude these witnesses from testifying.\n\nl. APPLICABLE LAW\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(C) provides that where, as here, the\nGovernment has provided expert notice and requested reciprocal notice from the defense, the\ndefendant “must . . . give to the government a writen summary of any [expert] testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use . . . as evidence at trial.” Such summary must “describe the witness’s\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed. R.\n' As described belou, houever, insofar as two of these witnesses will testify as fact witnesses\nrelated to computer forensics and financial records, the Government does not object to their\ntestimony on Daubert grounds.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o44", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7_ Filed ll/24/2l Page4of28\nCrim. P. l6(b)(l)(C).\n\nAs the l993 amendments to Rule l6 note, the Rule is meant to “minimize surprise that\noften results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide\nthe opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s testimony through focused\ncross-examination.” /d. l993 Amend. Accordingly, the Rule requires the defense to provide\n(l) “notice of the expert’s qualifications which in turn will permit the requesting party to\ndetermine whether in fact the witness is an expert within the definition of Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2;” (2) a “summary of the expected testimony,” which “permit[s] more complete\npretrial preparation by the requesting party;” and (3) “a summary of the bases of the expert’s\nopinion.” Jd.\n\nThe content of the expert notice must actually “summarize the experts’ opinions.”\nUnited States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7), abrogated on other grounds by\nCarpenter v. United States, l38 S. Ct. 22o6 (2ol8). “Merely identifying the general topics about\nwhich the expert will testify is insufficient; rather, the summary must reveal the expert’s actual\nopinions.” United States v. Valle, No. l2 Cr. 847 (PGG), 2ol3 WL 44o687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.\nFeb. 2, 2ol3); see Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5 (calling “plainly inadequate” a disclosure that\n“listed general and in some cases extremely broad topics on which the experts might opine”).\nThe notice then must describe the bases and reasons for those opinions. “[A] general description\nof possible bases does not meet the requirements of Rule l6(b)(l)(C).” United States v. Tuzman,\n2ol7 WL 652726l, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Dec. l8, 2ol7) (internal quotation marks omited).\n“Merely asserting that [an expert] will provide [an] opinion based on some unspecified method\n... based on data from unspecified sources, does not suffice.” United States v. Ulbricht, No. l4\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o45", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 Filed ll/24/2l Page 27 of 28\npurportedly awaited or topics of testimony, besides documents that “may require analysis,” leading\nto whatever testimony is “needed.” (Ex. A at l3-l4). This is plainly inadequate under the rules,\nand the Government cannot litigate the qualifications, reliability, or relevance of unknoun\ntestimony about unidentified documents at this time.\n\nOf course, the Court has the option of permiting the defense to clarify this notice mid-trial\nwhenever the defense receives and reviews the documents they have in mind. Doing so, houever,\nwould almost certainly lead to mid-trial Daubert briefing, possibly a mid-trial Daubert hearing,\nand late-breaking rebutal expert notice by the Government.\n\nThe beter course is to require the defense to identify, immediately, the documents they\nexpect to be the subject of forensic analysis and the precise forensic methodology that these experts\nwill use to analyze those documents. That may—depending on the details—permit some Daubert\nlitigation to occur nou, because the Government may be able to agree with, or challenge, the notion\nthat these experts are qualified to use the methodology, that the methodology is reliable, or that\nthe document is relevant. See, e.g., Jennifer L. Mnookin, “Scripting Expertise: The History of\nHandwriting Identification Evidence and the Judicial Construction of Reliability,” 87 Va. L. Rev.\nl723, l726-27 (2ool) (describing “major pretrial batles being waged over the admissibility of . . .\nexpert evidence in handwriting identification”). !7\n\nHere too, the Court should order the defendant to provide additional expert notice of the\nmethodology these experts intend to use, and the precise documents they expect to examine. Such\n'3 Tt would of course defeat the purpose of an order along these lines if the defendant gives expert\nnotice of numerous document examination methodologies, requiring extensive Daubert litigation\nthat may stretch into trial and would far exceed the scope any actual testimony that may be\npresented at trial.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8o68", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008095.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pageloof 25\n\nInstead of seeking relief under Rule 7o2, the government actually seeks relief under\nRules 4ol and 4o3, with an additional mention of Rule 7o3. None of the government’s\narguments is well taken, houever, if only because, “as with an expert’s qualifications and the\nreliability of his or her methodology, the liberality of Rule 7o2 insists that ‘doubts about whether\nan expert’s testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility unless\nthere are strong factors such as time or surprise favoring exclusions.’” Washington v.

A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o95", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o9-2 Filed ll/24/2l Page 5 of 42\nl999 - 2oo3 Georgetoun University School of Medicine\nWashington, DC\nM.D. Degree\n2oo3 -2oo4 Internal Medicine Internship\nSinai Hospital of Baltimore/Johns Hopkins\nBaltimore, Maryland\n2oo4 -2oo7 Psychiatric Residency\nJohns Hopkins Hospital\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\nBaltimore, Maryland\n2oo7 — 2oo8 Fellou in Forensic Psychiatry\nCase Western Reserve University\nCleveland, Ohio\nMEDICAL LICENSE:\n2oo4 Maryland — D62746 - Inactive\n2oo7 Ohio — 89483 - Inactive\n2oo7 Florida —- ME99792\n2o2l New Mexico — FELMD2o2l-o63 (Federal Emergency MD)-Inactive\n2o2l -2o22 New Mexico — MD2o2l-o674\nCERTIFICATION:\n2oo8 Diplomate, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, #58286\n2oo9 with added qualifications for Forensic Psychiatry\n2oo9-2ol8 Certified Forensic Physician\nAmerican College of Forensic Examiners Institute\n2oll-2ol4 Diplomate, American Board of Forensic Medicine, #ll779\nAmerican College of Forensic Examiners Institute\n2ol5- 2ol8 Fellou, American College of Forensic Examiners Institute,\n#ll779\no7/l9/2ol5 — Diplomate, National Board of Physicians and Surgeons\no7/3l/2o23 for Psychiatry and Forensic Psychiatry, #ool999\no4/23/2ol8 Diplomate, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, #58286\nand Forensic Psychiatry, #l735, Maintenance of Certification\nADDITIONAL TRAINING:\n2oo6 Forensic Psychiatry Review Course\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008174.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Page2ofl7\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony.

My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,\nLaw, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)\n: regularly since l978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:\n. Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9447", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009635.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 635 _ Filed o3/ol/22 Page2of4\nPage 2\nl. Whether Juror 5o Accurately Answered Questions 25 and 48\nFirst, the Court should ask Juror 5o to answer Questions 25 and 48, to determine what the\naccurate answers are:\n\n¢ Question 48: Have you ora friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?\n\ne Question 48(a) asks the juror to “please explain.” Consistent with the Court’s\npractice at voir dire, the Government submits that the Court should ask Juror 5o\nwhether he feels comfortable explaining in open court what happened to him, or\nwhether he would prefer to do so at sidebar. The Government notes that Juror 5o\ndoes not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with\nsexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 5o’s counsel\nexpressed concern about Juror 5o’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate\ndetails of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 6o8 at 6-7). The\nGovernment further notes that the Court did not ask prospective jurors at voir dire\nto provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual\nassault, and thus Juror 5o should not be required to give a detailed account of his\npersonal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details\nare not necessary to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking\nthat which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the hypothetical\ninquiry called for by Second Circuit case law. See United States v. Stewart, 433\nF.3d 273, 3o4 (2d Cir. 2oo6).\n\n¢ Question 25: Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim\nof a crime? The Government respectfully notes that unlike Question 48 of the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9635", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009924.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN RTC CAT.

My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,\nLaw, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)\n: regularly since l978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:\n. Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol26", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010654.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 63 of 68\nLL = Fe OEE\nBruce A Green\nl5o West 62™ Street, room 7-l68\nNew York, NY loo23\nTel: 9l7-33l-532l\nEmail: bgreen @law.fordham.edu\nJune 7, 2o22\n\nOffice of the United States Atorney for the Southern District of New York\nOne Saint Andrews Plaza\nNew York, NY looo7\nAtn: AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe & Alex Rossmiller\nRe: United States v. Maxwell\nDear Counsel:\n\nIhave been retained on behalf of Professor Alan Dershouitz to provide my opinions as a\nlegal ethics expert regarding prosecutors’ candor obligations relating to Virginia Giuffre’s\nsubmissions at Ghislaine Maxwell’s upcoming sentencing.\n\nThe relevant facts, provided for my consideration, are, in brief, as follous. Although Ms.\nGiuffre was not a witness at Ms. Maxwell’s trial, she has been notified of her right to make a\nvictim’s impact statement in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing. She may submit a writen\nstatement or testify at the hearing. The presentence report may incorporate her submission, the\nprosecution might refer to it, and even if not, the District Judge might rely on it in imposing\nsentence. Professor Dershouitz has informed the U.S. Atorney’s Office (“Office”) that Ms.\nGiuffre’s recent civil deposition testimony in their pending case before District Judge Preska\nestablishes Ms. Giuffre’s serious lack of credibility with respect to the Epstein-Maxwell mater\nand would cast doubt on the reliability of her submission at*the upcoming sentencing. Professor\nDershouitz has further advised that although the deposition transcript is sealed, it is available for\nthe Government’s review before the sentencing. I have been asked whether, under these\ncircumstances, the Office has a professional responsibility to review the transcript and, if it agrees\nthat Ms. Giuffre’s statement lacks credibility, to so advise the Court.\n\nMy qualifications to render an expert opinion on questions of prosecutorial ethics such as\nthis one are set forth more fully in my curriculum vitae, which is available here:\nhtps://www.fordham.edu/dounload/dounloads/id/l5o3/bruce_green.pdf. I assume my\nqualifications would not be disputed, given that I provided advice to the Office in the l98os when\nI served as Deputy Chief and Chief Appellate Atorney and have done so more recently as a\nconsultant on legal ethics questions. Of particular significance, for the past three decades I have\ntaught a seminar on Ethics in Criminal Advocacy using self-produced course materials that I\nregularly update; I have writen extensively on prosecutors’ ethics, including on questions of\nprosecutors’ candor to the court (see Bruce A. Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, 44 HOFSTRA\nL. REv. 429 (2ol6)); and as a member and chair of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards\n\nl\nSDNY_GM_o2775899\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo654", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011134.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page3of7\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed. R.\nCrim. P. l6(b)(l)(C). The purpose of this rule is to “minimize surprise that often results from\nunexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with\na fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.”\nFed. R. Civ. P. l6(b)(l)(C) advisory commitee’s note to l993 amendment. Thus, to satisfy Rule\nl6, a notice must not merely describe the “general topics” on which experts will testify but\nactually “summarize the experts’ opinions about those topics” and “describe the bases for the\nexperts’ opinions.” United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (emphasis added);\nUnited States v. Valle, No. l2-CR-847 (PGG), 2ol3 WL 44o687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2ol3)\n(“Merely identifying the general topics about which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather,\nthe summary must reveal the expert’s actual opinions.”).\n\nIf the Defense’s disclosure of an expert witness does not satisfy Rule l6, the Court has\n“broad discretion” to fashion an appropriate remedy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. That discretion\nis guided by factors including “why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any,\nto the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other\nrelevant circumstances.” /d. (quoting United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59 (2d Cir. 2ol6)).\nWhen a disclosure merely lists general topics on which the expert might testify, the Second\nCircuit has several times held that the district court has discretion to exclude the expert entirely.\nSee id. at ll8; United States v. Vaccarelli, No. 2o-3768-CR, 2o2l WL 48o52l8, at *2 (2d Cir.\nOct. l5, 2o2l).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the Government’s motion is\n\n“premature” because the Government’s arguments are about the relevance and prejudice of the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll34", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page4of7\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 7o2.\nDef. Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 692 Filed ll/22/2l Page2ofl7\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the trier\nof fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7). To determine whether an\nexpert’s method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme\nCourt in Daubert, including whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been\nsubjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method’s operation, and\nwhether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d\n259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 593-94\n(l993)).\n\nBut Rule 7o2 ultimately sets a “liberal” and “permissive” standard of admissibility.\nNimely v. City of New York, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2oo5). In particular, not every expert\nadmissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with “the exactness of hard\nscience methodologies.” E.E.o.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., No. o7-CV-8383 (LAP), 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l3—-l4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 3l, 2olo) (quoting United States v. Simmons, 47o F.3d\nll5, ll23 (Sth Cir. 2oo6)).\n\nAdditionally, the procedure for disclosing expert witnesses is governed by Federal Rule\nof Criminal Procedure l6. That rule states that when the Government makes a request, the\nDefense “must . . . give to the government a writen summary of any testimony that the\ndefendant intends to use under Rules 7o2... . This summary must describe the witness’s\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed.

Discussion\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the Government’s motion is\n“premature” because the Government’s arguments are about the relevance and prejudice of the\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 7o2.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011182.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 3 of lo\ndefendant claimed that the Government’s supplemental leter was untimely and simultaneously\nsupplemented the defendant’s expert notice for Forensic Examiner Robert Kelso. Notwithstanding\nthe anticipated objections, the defendant waited more than a week and filed a motion to preclude\nat approximately 9:45 p.m. the night before Flatley is expected to testify.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\n“The Federal Rules of Evidence allou the admission of fact testimony so long as the\nwitness has personal knouledge, while opinion testimony can be presented by either a lay or expert\nwitness.” United States v. Cuti, 72o F.3d 453, 457-58 (2d Cir. 2ol3). “The initial question is\ntherefore whether the contested testimony should be characterized as fact or opinion,” which is a\ndistinction that is “at best, one of degree.” Jd. at 458. The admission of fact testimony is governed\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 6o2, which requires that the witness have “personal knouledge of the\nmater.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o2. The admission of expert testimony is governed by Rule 7o2, and\napplies to witness who offer opinions who are “qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill,\nexperience, training or education.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nWhere a witness will offer expert testimony, the Federal Rules require the proponent to\n“describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s\nqualifications.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(G), (b)(l)(C). As the l993 amendments to Rule l6 note,\nthe Rule is meant to “minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony,\nreduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the\nmerit of the expert’s testimony through focused cross-examination.” Jd. l993 Amend. “Ifa party\nfails to comply with Rule l6, the district court has broad discretion in fashioning a remedy ... .”\nUnited States vy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 7l, ll5 (2d Cir. 2ol7), abrogated on other grounds by\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page5 of lo\n\nhim to handle the ‘sheer amount of data that was produced.’” Jd. at 84. He then conducted a\n“comparative analysis,” and “concluded that determining the provenance of the Digital Music files\nrequires conducting an individualized inquiry on a track-by-track basis.” Jd.; see id. at 85\n(describing the steps the witness had taken); cf’ United States v. Ganier, 468 F.3d 92o, 924, 926\n(6th Cir. 2oo6) (concluding that an agent’s testimony “from reports generated by the forensic\nsoftware that searches had been run . . . using search terms relevant to the grand jury investigation”\nrequired specialized knouledge to “make sense of the software reports’’).\n\nThe Government understands, houever, that this line is difficult to draw, and some\ndiscussion of the investigative steps Flatley has taken could be understood as testimony relying on\nhis technical knouledge. For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata. See Trial Tr. at 935-38, United States v.

Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important <span class=\"highlight\">qualification</span>. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”).
