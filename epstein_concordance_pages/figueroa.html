Sliker, 75l F.2d 477, 487 (2d Cir. l984). Here, the defendant’s specific and unique\napproach to preparing minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein demonstrate the existence of\nsuch an idiosyncratic patern warranting admission.\n\nOther acts evidence is, like all other evidence, inadmissible under Rule 4o3 if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nEvidence is unfairly prejudicial, houever, “only when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a\ndefendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.”\nUnited States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Figueroa</span>, 6l8 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. l98o). Other acts evidence is typically not\nunfairly prejudicial where it is not “any more sensational or disturbing than the crimes” with which\nthe defendant has been charged. United States v. Rolan-Zapata, 9l6 F.2d 795, 8o4 (2d Cir. l99o).\nHere, as already discussed, evidence regarding Minor Victim-3’s experiences with the defendant\nand Epstein are no more inflammatory or upseting than those of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. Those experiences include a wide range of abuse at the hands of Epstein, including\nabuse that the defendant witnessed and participated in herself. Evidence regarding similar events\ninvolving Minor Victim-3, who was of a similar age and experienced similar types of sexual\ncontact, is no more “sensational or disturbing” than the other acts detailed in the Indictment. /d.\nEvidence of other acts involving the grooming or abuse of minor victims is regularly admited for\nsimilar purposes in cases where charges allege sexual activity with minors. See, e.g., United States\nv. Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x 732, 737 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“As to the testimony concerning Vickers’\n‘grooming’ of his victims, we conclude that such evidence was admissible even under Rule 4o4(b),\nbecause it was probative of Vickers’ knouledge of hou to secure adolescent boys’ trust so that he\ncould sexually abuse them.

Belou, we address the\napplicable law, before turning to the specific relief the Government requests in this case. !\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees defendants the right to cross-examine witnesses\nwho testify against them. See, e.g., United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Figueroa</span>, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nThis right, houever, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F.

According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. <span class=\"highlight\">Figueroa</span>, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)).

See, e.g., United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Figueroa</span>, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8).\nThis right, houever, is not absolute. A defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause must\nyield to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. See, e.g., id. For\ninstance, trial courts have “wide latitude . . . to impose reasonable limits ... on. . . cross-\nexamination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, . . . or the\nwitness’s safety.” United States v. Al Farekh, 8lo F. App’x 2l, 25 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary\n' Simultaneously with the filing of this motion, the Government is filing a sealed leter providing\nthe names of the Minor Victims and witnesses identified in this section, along with certain other\npersonal information. The Government requests that the defense omit identifying information\nfrom its response brief or permit the Government an opportunity to seek necessary redactions or\nsealing.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 5o of 54\nX. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making the Baseless Argument\nthat the Defendant Was a Victim of Jeffrey Epstein\nIn order for counsel to ask questions or make argument about a fact, counsel must have a\ngood faith basis for advancing that fact. See, e.g., United States v. <span class=\"highlight\">Figueroa</span>, 548 F.3d 222, 227\n(2d Cir. 2oo8) (“Although counsel may explore certain areas of inquiry in a criminal trial without\nfull knouledge of the answer to anticipated questions, he must, when confronted with a demand\nfor an offer of proof, provide some good faith basis for questioning that alleges adverse facts.”\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The Government’s years-long investigation has\nnot developed any evidence that the defendant was victimized in any way by Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe Government has also met with the defense many times, both prior to presenting this case to a\ngrand jury and when conferring during the pendency of this mater. During one of those\nmeetings, defense counsel made a variety of factual assertions in order to dissuade the\nGovernment from charging the defendant. At no time has the defense represented to the\nGovernment that Epstein victimized the defendant in any manner. In preparing these motions,\nthe Government asked the defense whether they plan to offer such evidence at trial, and defense\ncounsel declined to answer. !!\n'T Ag set forth in the Government’s cover leter, the Government seeks redaction of this section.\nWere this argument discussed in public filings, it would likely result in significant publicity,\nwhich would be highly prejudicial to the Government if in fact there is no good-faith basis for\nthe argument, as the Government suspects will be the case. Accordingly, the Court should\npermit redaction and sealing of this section at least until the conclusion of trial.\n49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of24\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES\n\nCases\nAmorgianos v.
