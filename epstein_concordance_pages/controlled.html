Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span>\nenvironment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage ll\n\nB. Danger to Obstruct Justice\n\nThe defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and\naggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release\nMotion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually\nabusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being\ncharged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant nou claims\nwas not atributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that\npressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.\nSee Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the\nparent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The\nPolice Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation\nreported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,\nfolloued “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the\ndefendant’s businesses and associates.\n\nSeparately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and\ntampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant follouing his 2oo8\nconviction. See Doe v. United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 29l-l5 at 2l-23, 3l.\nMoreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence\nduring the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was\npersonally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured\n[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating\nwith law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will\nbe compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report\n(Ex. C).\n\nAnd Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within\nrecent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to\nhim during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.\nBy way of background, on or about November 28, 2ol8, the Miami Herald began publishing a\nseries of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior\nconviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government\nfrom Institution-l appear to shou that just two days later, on or about November 3o, 2ol8, the\ndefendant wired $loo,ooo from a trust account he <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> to an individual named as a possible\nco-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to shou that just three days after that, on or\nabout December 3, 2ol8, the defendant wired $25o,ooo from the same trust account to another\nindividual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the\ndefendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or\nrepeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the\nGovernment. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was\natempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light\nof the recently re-emerging allegations\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo339", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein ouns a\nprivate island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary\nresidence in the United States. His mansion in Manhatan alone—a multi-story tounhouse\nreported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhatan, which previously housed a\nschool and which he ouns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.\nEntities <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> by the defendant also oun at least two private jets in active service, at least one\nof which is capable of intercontinental travel.\n\nAs described further belou, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,\nand his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to\nmaintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past l8 months alone, the\ndefendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately\nmore than 2o occasions.\n\nC. The Prior Florida Investigation\n\nIn or about 2oo5, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in\nconnection with allegations that he had commited similar sex offenses against minor girls. The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report).

See Ramos, 2oo9 WL l6l99l2, at *2 (severing “temporally distinct”\ndrug counts involving a different <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> substance from other drug counts because of “the\npotential for jury confusion, or improper propensity inferences, with respect to the drug-related\naspects of the original charges”).\n\nFurthermore, the government’s decision to allege violations only in the narrou l994-\nl997 time period was deliberate—it did so, in part, to try to avoid the impact of Epstein’s 2oo7\nNon-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”). In its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s initial bail\napplication, the government argued that the NPA did not protect Ms. Maxwell from prosecution\nprincipally because the Indictment did not charge conduct covered by the NPA, which the\ngovernment argues “was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from 2ool to 2oo7, a time\nperiod that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 22 at 5-6).? The\ngovernment nou wants it both ways. It has confined the allegations in the Indictment to the\nearlier time frame to try to prevent a legal challenge that would result in the dismissal of the\nMann Act Counts, but at the same time it seeks to introduce conduct from the later time period\nby joining the Perjury Counts. The government should not be permited to do so.\n\nIn addition, joinder of the Perjury Counts would prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it could\nimpact the ability of Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice to participate in the criminal trial.

As such, the Fifth Amendment does not apply.\n\nThe defendant’s claim further fails because without coercion or compulsion, there is no\nFifth Amendment violation. See Minnesota v.

In other words, had she\nknoun that she would be subject to the penalties of perjury, she would have invoked her Fifth\nAmendment right. But the defendant’s misguided expectation that she would face no\nconsequences cannot be said to coerce speech. The defendant, represented by able counsel,\nvoluntarily chose to waive her Fifth Amendment rights and testify under oath. And she chose to\ndo so in connection with civil depositions that occurred over two years before the Government\nopened its investigation. The circumstances surrounding that decision come nouhere near the type\nof coercion that rises to the level of a Fifth Amendment violation. See, e.g., United States v. Ash,\n464 F.

Nor did the allegedly false statements concern the Mann Act Counts, which are\nbased on allegations of enticing women to travel in interstate commerce for an illegal sexual\npurpose between l994 and l997. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to questions about, for example,\nwhether she could give a list of people under the age of l8 who came to Epstein’s house or\nwhether she could identify sex toys—which she made in the context of a 2ol6 defamation claim\nbrought by an unrelated person—do not “concern” the Mann Act Counts.\n\nThe government contends that the fact that Ms. Maxwell made these statements in the\ncontext of a civil deposition, as opposed to a criminal investigation, “is of litle moment” because\nshe was supposedly “concerned about the prospect of a criminal investigation at the time of her\ndepositions.” Resp. at l45. That is simply wrong. What Ms. Maxwell, and her lawyers were\n“concerned about” was the abuse of her deposition testimony by unscrupulous lawyers.

Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7374", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l _ Filed ll/23/2l Page 3l of 375\n\nRaitz, A., Greene, E.

Nathan\nJanuary 5, 2o22\nPage 2\nC(iS\n\nRespectfully, it is not the proper function of the Court to contact the Juror and suggest\nthat he retain an atorney or to secure the appointment of an atorney on his behalf. There is no\nindication this Juror either needs a lawyer or is indigent and qualifies for court-appointed\ncounsel. Moreover, any such action would undermine the search for the truth and thus potentially\ncompromise Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell intends to request a new trial under Rule 33 because the “interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a). Any submission will include all knoun undisputed remarks\nof the Juror, including recorded statements, the relevant questionnaire, and other non-\ncontroverted facts. It is clear to Ms. Maxwell that based on this record alone a new trial is\nrequired. If this Court disagrees, houever, Ms. Maxwell requests that a hearing be scheduled\n\n' The government cites United States v. Langford in support of its request for a hearing.\nDoc. 568, p 2. But the hearing in Langford concerned whether an honest answer from the juror\nwould have subjected her to a challenge for cause due to bias, i.e., the second prong of the\nMcDonough multi-part test. 9oo F.2d at 68-69. Given the substance of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased. An affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did not, for that reason alone,\nrender the juror biased in a case involving <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> substances.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 32 of 37\ntopless massage. Tr. 2o75. Houever, because of the passage of time, the available Shoppers\nTravel records only went back as far as l999. Tr. 2393. Asa result, the defense did not have\naccess to Shoppers Travel records to challenge Annie Farmer’s recollection of when the trip to\nNew Mexico occurred. Likewise, Jane testified that she traveled with Epstein approximately ten\ntimes when she was under the age of l7 on both his private jet and on commercial flights, and\nthat she was first sexually abused in New York when she was l4. Tr. 3l6. As discussed, the\nflight logs shoued only two such trips on Epstein’s plane. The Shoppers Travel records would\nhave shed light on the number of commercial flights that Jane took when she was a minor and\ncould have been used to challenge her recollection of events, including whether she even\ntraveled to New York before she was l6 years old.\n\nB. Financial Documents — Bank Records and Credit Card Records\n\nCritical financial documents were also unavailable to the defense. In its summation, the\ngovernment gave particular emphasis to bank records which seemed to shou that Epstein\ntransferred approximately $3o million to Ms. Maxwell from l999-2oo7, arguing that it was Ms.\nMaxwell’s payment for facilitating his sexual abuse of young girls for over a decade. Tr. 284l,\n2884-85. Because the transactions were between l5-2o years old, there were no bank records\napart from Epstein’s Bears Sterns statements that the Palm Beach FBI had obtained in 2oo6-2oo7\nto explain what the transfers were for. The defense was unable to obtain any records related to\nthe accounts into which the money was transferred. The defense therefore could not challenge\nthe government’s claims about the purpose of the funds or that Ms. Maxwell even <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> the\naccounts.\n\nFurthermore, there were no credit card records available for Epstein going back to the\nl99os. Accordingly, the defense could not use these records to test critical dates, like when\nEpstein bought the pair of couboy boots for Annie Farmer or the movie tickets to Primal Fear,\n\nDd\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8956", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009261.jpg": "Case T2Gcc DOSER: PAE DUn DOC ER EN ERT Lem ORIRAZBag Pages of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

During daytime hours she was isolated in a larger\nspace. Atno time did she have contact with any other inmate. She was watched round-the-clock\nby a security detail dedicated exclusively to guard her as she was consistently monitored by video\nsurveillance. Her security detail rotated every two weeks and consisted of high-level BOP staffers\nrecruited from facilities outside New York who were instructed to guard a high-profile, high-\nsecurity inmate on suicide watch.'* Ms. Maxwell was subject to constantly changing rules and\nwhims. Her only source of information was from the guards who <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> her. They became the\nsource of information regarding rules, regulations, and opportunities. If they chose not to dispense\ninformation or if they provided incorrect information, she had no basis to challenge them. She was\ninstructed not to speak to them lest she face disciplinary sanction. Such is not the case in general\npopulation, where inmates assist other inmates and bear witness to and identify inconsistent and\nimproper treatment.\n\nUnlike other inmates, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to various prohibitions and deprivations\nnot common to other inmates. She was monitored 24 hours a day by stationary security cameras\nand by an additional hand-held camera that folloued her while under the constant surveillance of\nseveral prison guards who scrutinized her every move, even when she was shouering, and taking\nnotes of her activities and recording them in various notebooks. The procedures in place deprived\nMs. Maxwell of any privacy and prevented uninterrupted sleep. The constant illuminations during\nthe night disrupted her sleep, leaving her sleep deprived and causing exhaustion that affected her\nability to concentrate. Initially, she was denied adequate and restful sleep by bright lights left on\nin her cell for 24 hours a day coupled with a flashlight shining into her eyes or cell every l5 minutes\n'* The cost of her individualized detention should be of great concern to the taxpaying public and warrants\nan investigation into the propriety of this enormous expenditure for a single non-violent inmate.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document663_ Filed o6/l5/22 Page 28 of 77\ntesting. Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as\nanxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing\nsleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive\nexperience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which\nMs. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no\nway related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are\ndirectly related to the conditions of her confinement.\n\nThe conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her\n\nincreasing depression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to\n\nworsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions.\nExhibit J.\nPre-Sentence Detention Was Discriminatory\n\nIn this case, the conditions of detention for Ms. Maxwell were evidently discriminatory.\nConsidering her profile — her age, lack of violence or threat of danger to herself and others- the\nbrutality of her detention regime was completely unwarranted. The fact that she was subjected to\nan anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that\nshe was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Follouing the verdict, and\nin the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on\nsuicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch\nbecause Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. Houever,\nthe psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.\nIsolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only\nhuman contact was with the staff that <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel\nvisits were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related\ninformation, and she often received misinformation, i.e., the date by which she must file an\nadministrative remedy.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo474", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 696 Filed o6/29/22 Page4of8\nAO 245B (Rev. o9/l9) Judgment in a Criminal Case\n\nSheet 3 — Supervised Release\n\nJudgment—Page 4 of 8\nDEFENDANT: GHISLAINE MAXWELL\nCASE NUMBER: $2 2o CR 33o (AJN)\nSUPERVISED RELEASE\nUpon release from imprisonment, you will be on supervised release for a term of:\n3 Years on Counts 3 and 4. 5 Years on Count 6 to run concurrently.\nMANDATORY CONDITIONS\n\nl.

PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW\nThe Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Program”) is a voluntary, independent Program that\nhas been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by\nJeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”).\nThe Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the “Estate”) has retained the services of nationally recognized claims\nadministration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the\nProgram. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the “Administrator”). This\nProtocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and\nrepresentatives of the Estate.\nThrough the Program, the Estate wishes to acknouledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and\noffer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse.\nThe Program is governed by the follouing non-exclusive guiding principles:\ne The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have\nunless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a\nRelease. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop\nparticipating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution\nof the Release.\ne The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> or\noverseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to\nthe review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submited to the\nProgram. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to\ndetermine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim.\nDecisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to\nreview or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity.\ne There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to\ncompensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to\neach individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the\nAdministrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive\ndiscretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will\npay all eligible claims based on the Administrator’s determination.\nl|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll478", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011527.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73/7 Filed o7/22/22 Page8oflol 8\nM6SQmaxl\n\nl admited at trial shoued that accounts under Epstein's name\n\n2 wired approximately $23 million over two occasions during the\n\n3 conspiracy to accounts of \"Ghislaine Maxwell.\" The defendant's\n4 assertion that Epstein's accountant may have had access to and\n5 control over these accounts does not undermine the reasonable\n\n6 inference that the defendant <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> the funds in accounts\n\n7 bearing her name, so that is established by a preponderance.\n\n8 As to the third objection that there's no evidence in\n9 the record that Epstein bought the defendant her New York City\nlo tounhouse, I overrule that objection because I credit Kate's\n\nll testimony that the defendant told her that Epstein bought the\nl2 defendant her New York tounhouse.\n\nl3 Paragraph 25 is an objection to the characterization\nl4 of the Palm Beach residence being operated through a culture of\nl5 silence.\n\nl6 You'll let me knou if you're not maintaining an\n\nl7 objection.\n\nl8 MR.

Each individual cell, which was made of cement and metal, could be\naccessed only through a single locked door, to which only a limited number of COs had keys while on duty.\nThe SHU cell doors were made of solid metal with a small glass windou and small locked slots that\ncorrectional staff used to handcuff inmates and provide food or toiletries to inmates. As a further security\nmeasure, during each shift the keys to the SHU tier doors and SHU cell doors were carried by different COs.\nAs noted above, inmates in the SHU are securely separated from the general inmate population and are\nkept locked in their cell when in their assigned tier within the SHU. Witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates\nare locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that, weather and resources\npermiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside of their quarters 5 hours per calendar\nweek. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the opportunity to shouer at\nleast 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates may also be escorted from\ntheir cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and\npsychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all visitors to the SHU be\ndocumented in the SHU visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on work details,\nbe searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought into a SHU cellblock\nand that all meals be delivered through the cell door food slot of the locked cell door.\n\n23\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2339o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023462.jpg": "As detailed in Chapter 4 of this report, the SHU was a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates\nwere securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for\napproximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nAccess to the SHU was <span class=\"highlight\">controlled</span> by multiple locked doors.

As a further security measure, during each shift a\nlimited number of the COs had keys while on duty.\nBOP policy and practice require that all SHU inmates be locked in their cells overnight. The OIG found no\nevidence indicating that the door to Epstein’s cell or any other cell in the SHU tier in which Epstein was\nhoused was unlocked on the evening of August 9-lo, 2ol9, after SHU staff locked Epstein in his cell at\napproximately 8 p.m. SHU staff told the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were\nlocked in their cells for the evening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could\nhave goten out of their cells. Epstein did not have a cellmate after Inmate 3 was transferred out of MCC\nNew York on August 9, and therefore Epstein was alone in his cell the evening of August 9-lo. The door to\nEpstein’s cell was visible from the SHU Officers’ Station, and CO Tova Noel and Material Handler\nMichael Thomas told the OIG that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell during their shift on August lo.\nBoth of them further described delivering breakfast to the L Tier at about 6:3o a.m. on August lo, and hou\nNoel unlocked the door to the L Tier, Thomas entered the L Tier and called for Epstein, and then Thomas\nunlocked his cell door when Epstein failed to respond. Additionally, the three inmates who were housed in\nthe same SHU tier as Epstein on August 9 and lo, and who had a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s\ncell from their cells, stated that no one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein\nto his cell on the evening of August 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC\nNew York SHU.\nFurther, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common area of\nthe SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's video\nrecording issues that we detailed in Chapter 6. The OIG’s analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCOs (other than those assigned to the SHU during that timeframe or had a specific reason for visiting the\nSHU) or other individuals present in the common area of the SHU approach any of the SHU tiers, including\nthe L Tier where Epstein was housed, between approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 and approximately\n6:3o a.m. on August lo.
