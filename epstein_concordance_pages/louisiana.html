It says nothing about the process by which a Master\nWheel is reduced to the subset of qualified jurors contained in the Qualified Wheel. Because the\n“systematic defect” alleged by the defendant relates to the Master Jury Wheel, the White Plains\nMaster Jury Wheel is the appropriate “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 93o F. Supp. at l566-68.\n\nAlthough the Master Jury Wheel does not include reliable information regarding the race\nand ethnicity of the individuals selected from voter registration lists, the racial and ethnic makeup\nof the White Plains Master Jury Wheel can be estimated using geocoding and Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (“BISG”).© Taking into account those estimates, the White Plains Master\nWheel is ll.2o% Black or African-American and l2.97% Hispanic or Latino.

Siskin, which was prepared for the\nGovernment in Balde. As detailed Dr. Skiskin’s report, geocoding is based on estimating the\nproportion of persons who are of a given race or ethnicity based on the racial and ethnic area in\nwhich they live. (See Affidavit of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin (“Siskin Aff.”), atached hereto as Exhibit\nl2, at § 26).

See Duren, 439 US. at 364. “There is systematic exclusion\n* The government’s contention that the relevant jury pool to be measured against the comparison community is the\nWhite Plains master wheel rather than the White Plains qualified wheel, even if accepted, does not change the\noutcome.

In any event, the White Plains qualified\nwheel is the appropriate jury pool, as fair-cross-section motions concern the actual “venires from which juries are\nselected.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364; see also Taylor v. <span class=\"highlight\">Louisiana</span>, 4l9 U.S. 522, 538 (l975) ( [T]he jury wheels,\npools of names, panels, or venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in\nthe community.”).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo377o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005439.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 46 of 54\nautomatically admit his alternative explanation for his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in his\nout-of-court statements to others on social media or to prison officials.”). The Government is\nable to introduce the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. <span class=\"highlight\">Louisiana</span>, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v. Johnson, 5o7 F.3d 793, 796 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5439", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006406.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 46 of 54\nautomatically admit his alternative explanation for his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in his\nout-of-court statements to others on social media or to prison officials.”). The Government is\nable to introduce the defendant’s statements as statements of an opposing party under Federal\nRule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(A). See Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(A) (defining as “not hearsay” a\nstatement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But the Federal Rules\ncontain no parallel provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F.2d at 84. Instead, if the\ndefendant wishes to place her oun statements before the jury, she must testify so the\nGovernment may cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56, l53 (2d Cir.\n2oo3) (holding that defendant “could have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]\nhe could not offer the document itself for the truth of the mater asserted”), overruled on other\ngrounds by Montejo v. <span class=\"highlight\">Louisiana</span>, 556 U.S. 778 (2oo9).\n\nNotwithstanding the hearsay bar, a defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the\nso-called “rule of completeness” to require the introduction of additional portions of his or her\noun out-of-court statement when the Government offers excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. lo6\n(“If a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party may require\nthe introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other writing or recorded statement—that\nin fairness ought to be considered at the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a\nstatement may be hearsay, an ‘omited portion of [the] statement must be placed in evidence if\nnecessary to explain the admited portion, to place the admited portion in context, to avoid\nmisleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admited portion.’”\nUnited States v.

The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of\nconviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that\n“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the\ndefendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquital of any offense for which the evidence is\ninsufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed.

Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson, 443 U.S. at 3l9\n(citing Johnson v. <span class=\"highlight\">Louisiana</span>, 4o6 U.S. 356, 362 (l972)); United States v.
