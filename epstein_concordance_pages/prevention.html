In those circumstances, it is highly unlikely that\nMs Maxwell would be able to rely on Article 3 to defeat a request for her extradition.\nArticle 6 (fair trial)\n\n37. Article 6 ECHR protects the right to a fair trial, and the European Court of Human Rights has noted\nthat Article 6 is “strikingly similar” to the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution”. An issue may\nexceptionally be raised under Article 6 in an extradition case in circumstances where the requested\nperson risks suffering a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country”. The test of ‘flagrant\ndenial’ is particularly high, requiring a court to find not only that the trial would be unfair, but that\nthere would be “a total nullification of the right to a fair trial’”® In practice, this threshold is rarely\novercome in extradition cases and it has never been met in a US extradition case. In those\ncircumstances, it is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to successfully invoke Article 6 to\nresist her extradition.\n\nArticle 8 (private and family life)\n\n38. Article 8 ECHR protects the right to private and family life. In assessing Article 8, the court is\nrequired to conduct a balancing exercise where factors in favour of extradition, including the\n“constant and weighty” public interests in honouring extradition treaties and ensuring that people\naccused of crimes should be brought to trial, are weighed against any personal or other factors that\nwould render extradition an interreference with private or family life. The test is whether any\ninterference would be disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued by extradition”. In practice, the\nmore serious the offence, the more difficult it is to establish that extradition would be\ndisproportionate. Given the nature of the charges that she faces, it is highly unlikely that such an\nargument would succeed in Ms Maxwell’s case.\n\nConclusion\n\n39. In conclusion, if the United States were to request Ms Maxwell’s extradition in circumstances where\nshe had absconded to the United Kingdom in breach of bail conditions imposed in the United States, it\nis extremely unlikely that she would be granted bail and highly unlikely that she would be able\n\n*?

Accordingly, the\nLandgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2oo3 Amendment is not\nretroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. Houever, even if the\nanalysis advances to step two, application of the 2oo3 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged\nconduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a\ncriminal statute of limitations.\n\nA. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a\n\nproposal to do so.\n\nThe first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal\nreach of the 2oo3 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2oo3\nAmendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2oo3 Amendment\nomit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that\nCongress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous\ncongressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of\nLandgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second\nLandgraf step.\n\n“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 264\n(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5899\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 43\n\n298 — S.

There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure.

STERNHEIAA\nthe effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, “sleep deprivation result[s] in a loss of\ncognitive flexibility through feedback...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with\ndynamic atentional control.” 4\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate\nmeaningfully in her defense have been gradually eroded over time due to the conditions of her\nconfinement and are further exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation. The conditions of her\nconfinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue\nto worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the\nregiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily\nhumiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial\nwould likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare\nher defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the\ncommunity. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has\nsteadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her\nand is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she\nwould atempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.\n\nThe bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported\nto Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens\ntheir vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide\nrisk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The\nproblem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”\n\n*Honn, K. A., Hinson, J. M., Whitney, P., & Van Dongen, H.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, financial, and social consequences.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations l23\n\nSetrakian, L.

These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions. It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, measurement\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

Craven et al.\nweaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn belou. First, O’Connell defines sexual\ngrooming as:\n\nA course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable\n\nperson cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be\n\nfor unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2oo3, p. 6)\n\nSecond, Houit suggests that:\n\nGrooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in\n\nsomeways analogous to adult courtship. (Houit, l995, p. l76)\n\nThese two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most\nsexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as\npaedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable\nto all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent\nsome offenders from acknouledging their oun grooming behaviours. In addition, people\nknoun to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider\nthe individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is\nlitered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may\naffect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.\nThese misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims knou their abuser. It is\nimportant that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual\ngrooming and the subsequent <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> or ending of abuse.\n\nFurthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.\nAdditional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.\nAlthough legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and\nhence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at\nbest, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.\nConsequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual\ngrooming behaviours.\n\nGillespie (2oo2) provides the third definition:\n\nThe process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an atempt to gain the\n\nchild’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive\n\nactivity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,\n\n2oo2, p. 4ll; based on van Dam, 2ool)\n\nThis definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the\npurpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This\nappears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this\ndefinition will follou consideration of previous literature and current understanding about\nsexual grooming.\n\nPrevalence\n\nCanter, Hughes and Kirby (l998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming\nphenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction\nbetween 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct\nbehaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim\ninteraction acknouledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6824\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid disclosure. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding disclosure.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it.

This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance\nthe knouledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved\nin disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for\nadults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study\n. conducted by Quas ef al. (2oo5) indicated that the consequences of legal\nlegal system will lead involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the\nto further child’s reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations\npsychological trauma between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors\nneed to be considered’ suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some\nadverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at\nincreased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative atitudes\nof others touard them. Quas and Goodman’s (2oll) recent review notes that\nolder children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes.\nThus, as noted earlier, young people’s fears of the consequences of disclosure\nmay well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure\nof sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may\ngo some way to addressing children’s fears.\n‘Many young people One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who\nwho delayed delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2oo8) and Ungar\n. et al. (2oo9b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure\ndisclosure to an adult among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless\nhad told a friend’ of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a ‘critical period’ for\ndisclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those\nat risk of abuse) may be a pouerful <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> tool in encouraging early\ndisclosure. Evaluations of child abuse <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> programmes have shoun\nsignificant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children\nand young people (Rispers et al., l997; Zwi et al., 2oo7). It may be that the\nincreasing trend touards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational\nand awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

Houever, the lack of control that young\npeople experience follouing disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2oo9b;\nQuayle et al., 2ol2). This highlights the need for dissemination of information\ndirectly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of\ndisclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young\npeople and their families interface with the legal system.\n\nThe more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in | ‘More recent focus on\nmaking disclosures rather than solely on identifying barriers to disclosure is investigating those\nperhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and :\nprofessional interventions.

Their findings in confidentiality\nrelation to the importance of bridge building for young people to access formal\nsupports are supported by Jensen ef al.’s (2oo5) emphasis on the dialogical\nnature of disclosure, and the important role that trusted adults and peers play\nin the disclosure process through noticing signs of psychological distress and\nasking young people about their psychological wellbeing (Collings ef al.,\n\n2oo5; Jensen ef al., 2oo5; McElvaney et al., 2ol2). More emphasis is therefore\nneeded on providing opportunities for children and young people to disclose.\nThe challenge for professionals and those who care for children is hou to do\nthis in a way that protects children and promotes their wellbeing.\n\nReferences\n\nCollings SJ, Griffiths S$, Kumalo M. 2oo5.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the\nOIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day. BOP policy provides that,\nweather and resources permiting, SHU inmates will have the opportunity to exercise outside their quarters\n5 hours per calendar week. Under federal regulations and BOP policy, SHU inmates ordinarily have the\nopportunity to shouer at least 3 times a week, typically on different days in l-hour periods. SHU inmates\nmay also be escorted from their cells by MCC New York staff for visits, including legal visits, court\nappearances, medical and psychological atention. The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that all\nvisitors to the SHU be documented in a visitor log, and that any inmate visiting the SHU, such as inmates on\nwork details, be searched visually and with a hand-held metal detector, without exception. The MCC\nNew York SHU Post Orders also require that food carts be searched inside and out before being brought\ninto a SHU cellblock and that all meals be delivered to each inmate's cell through the food slot in the\ninmate's locked cell door.\nBOP policy provides that inmates housed in the SHU for 3o continuous calendar days are to be examined\nand interviewed by a mental health staff member to assess the inmate's adjustment and the threat\npresented to self or others.\nBOP policy also requires that all staff assigned to the SHU participate in quarterly training on, among other\nthings, orderly supervision, suicide <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span>, and security procedures relating to the unit. When a staff\nmember is assigned to the SHU at the last-minute and has not completed the quarterly training, the staff\nmember must be advised of the general requirements of a SHU post and be permited to ask questions\nabout the duties.\n2. Inmate Accountability\"\na. Counts\nInmate counts serve an important security function, as they enable COs to ensure that all inmates are\naccounted for and present at the appropriate location within the facility. BOP policy requires that each\ninstitution “conduct, at a minimum, five official inmate counts during every 24-hour period,” and that on\n“weekends and holidays an additional count will be conducted at lo:oo a.m.” At least l count a day during\nthe week and 2 counts a day on weekends and holidays must be “stand-up counts,” which means that\ninmates are required to stand when they are counted. MCC New York SHU Post Orders designate that\ncounts must occur at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m., 4 p.m., and that stand-up counts are to be conducted at lo p.m.\ndaily and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe BOP requires that each count be conducted by at least two officers, one of whom will count the inmates\nwhile the other observes the unit for any unauthorized movement from the end of the tier. This\nrequirement is also set out in the MCC New York SHU Post Orders. The two officers will then switch roles\nand compare the count numbers. If the totals do not match, then the officers must conduct another count\nin the same manner. When conducting the count, officers are required to observe each inmate's body and\nnot rely solely on movement or sound. Officers conducting the count relay the count verbally to the Control\nThis section describes inmate accountability measures that are most relevant to this investigation and review. The\nBOP utilizes a variety of other security and inmate accountability tools in addition to those discussed in this section,\nwhich are described in BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023378.tif": "admission to the institution. The goal of this screening is to determine “the inmate’s security, medical,\npsychological, and/or other special needs.” The BOP also requires that institutions screen pretrial inmates\n“returning from court, as events at court may alter the inmate's separation and/or security needs.” BOP\npolicy further recognizes that there are often “high security, high profile inmates” who may present a\nsignificant threat to themselves or others, and that the “need to identify and monitor these inmates\nregularly is paramount.”\nb. Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span>\nThe BOP’s suicide <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> program is governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 552.4o-552.42, which\nrequire the BOP to establish a suicide <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> program to identify and manage potentially suicidal\ninmates. Pursuant to these regulations, when an inmate is identified as being at-risk for commiting suicide,\nBOP staff must place the inmate on suicide watch until the inmate is no longer an imminent risk.\nBOP policy (Program Statement 5324.o8, Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Program) requires that medical staff screen all\nnew inmates, ordinarily within 24 hours, for signs of suicidality. Houever, at MCCs, among other facilities\nwith high rates of admissions and short lengths of stays, “comprehensive psychological intake conducted by\nPsychology Services ordinarily will be performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or\nappear psychologically unstable.” Inmates in the SHU are monitored more closely, and inmates exhibiting\nsigns of potential suicide risk are referred to the shift Lieutenant. BOP policy recognizes that inmates who\nare placed in the SHU due to a request for protective custody are at greater risk of commiting suicide and\nshould therefore be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 hours of arriving in the SHU. BOP policy\nexplicitly states that “staff must never take lightly any inmate suicide threats.” Any staff member who has\nreason to believe that an inmate may be suicidal should “ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct,\ncontinuous observation.”\nEvery BOP institution must have one or more rooms, ordinarily in the health services area, dedicated to\ninmates placed on suicide watch. Suicide watch may be conducted by specially trained staff or inmates. For\ninmates placed on suicide watch, the specially trained staff or inmate maintains continuous observation of\nthe inmate believed to be at risk of commiting suicide. Follouing suicide watch and based on clinical\nfindings follouing a face-to-face evaluation, the inmate will be removed from suicide watch or transferred to\na medical referral or health care facility. Psychological observation is a less restrictive form of individual\nmonitoring that is used for inmates who are stabilizing and not yet prepared for placement in general\npopulation or restrictive housing. While on suicide watch, the inmate is normally required to wear a suicide\nwatch goun and will be alloued a suicide watch blanket.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, witnesses told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch\nwhen the inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant\nobservation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special matress,\nblanket, and smock to wear. Although psychological observation is a louer classification, witnesses told the\nOIG that at MCC New York the psychological observations was the same as suicide watch except that\ninmates were alloued to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by the\nPsychology Department.

Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that\nsleeping on the floor was not alloued and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.\nWhen Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said\nhe knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch. According to Inmate 3,\nthe Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3\nshould keep an eye on him. Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to\nserve as a suicide <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.\nInmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment.\nAccording to Inmate 3, COs brought two matresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.\nEpstein put the matresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door\nwindou when the cell door is closed. Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate\n3 said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets.\nInmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate\nbecause Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. Epstein told Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not\ngoing to cause Inmate 3 any trouble.\nthat inmates were physically located in the cells to which they were assigned in SENTRY. Associate Warden l told the\nOIG that the error would have been identified if SHU staff members had conducted a bed-book count, but there was no\nrequirement to do a bed-book count every certain number of days. Associate Warden l explained that during a bed-\nbook count, the staff members have a roster with them while conducting the count of inmates assigned to their housing\nunit to ensure all inmates are accounted for and in their assigned cells. The OIG’s investigation revealed that these and\nother cell assignment and recordkeeping errors would have been uncovered had MCC New York SHU staff been\nundertaking inmate accountability measures, such as rounds, counts, census checks, and bed-book checks.\n\n34\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023409.tif": "Psychologist l noted that during Physician Assistant l’s initial intake evaluation, on the intake questionnaire,\nEpstein denied having a history of mental health treatment and any history of mental health symptoms.\nAdditionally, Forensic Psychologist l noted no suicidal ideations, atempts, or self-harm; no history of\nsubstance abuse or treatment; and no sexual offense convictions.\nDuring the evaluation, Epstein stated he had been previously incarcerated for 3 months for “prostitution,”\nand that he was currently charged with sex trafficking. Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\nQuestionnaire, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day. During Epstein’s period of psychological observation,\ninmate companions continuously observed him and kept a log that detailed Epstein’s activities in l5-minute\nincrements. Under BOP policy, on a case-by-case basis, the Warden may authorize such an inmate\n27 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that mental health care is classified into “levels,”\nnot “codes.”\n\n42\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023410.tif": "companion program at an institution to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised\nby the institution’s Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Program Coordinator.\nOn July 9, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein. She reviewed Epstein’s\nmedical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.\nEpstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any\nhistory of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s\nassessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The\nChief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as\nnegative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.\nThe Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his\nrisk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on\npsychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a\nsuicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.\nOn July lo, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,\naccording to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and\ninteracting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns\nover being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be\nhoused in the SHU and had also requested a shouer, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist\nstated Epstein had been provided a shouer on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,\nto which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein\nstated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief\nPsychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be\nreleased from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with\na cellmate and would be seen the follouing morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Follouing\nthis July lo assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with\ndocumented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.\nThe follouing day, July ll, 2ol9, the Staff Psychologist atempted to see Epstein in the morning and\nafternoon, but he was meeting with his atorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with\nEpstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the atorney conference area for a psychological\nobservation follou-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,\nincluding not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his atorney conference, and a\ndesire to atend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief\nPsychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this\nclinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was\nreceptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the\nPsychology Department.

Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on\npsychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by\ninmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in\nthe Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein\nstating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it\nwould be crazy to take his oun life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI\nthat follouing her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2ol9, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his\nself-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed\nsigns of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable\ntaking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was\na step doun from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the\nconsent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic\nPsychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation alloued him to possess hygiene\nproducts, two novels, atend legal visits, and take shouers. It also alloued him to have standard inmate\nclothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. Houever, Forensic Psychologist 2\nexplained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they\nare re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being\nhoused in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for\nhim to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological\nobservation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal\nto remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein\nwas again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.\nAccording to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2ol9, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the\nStaff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP\nreports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on\nJuly 23, 2ol9, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was\nprovided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that\nEpstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he\ncould not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.\nThe Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2ol9, and he was in\ngood spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2ol9 incident\nand asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told\nthe OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions\nregarding the possible suicide atempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the\nBOP’s National Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex\noffender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.\nBOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2ol9, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist\nthat he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise\nwas similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be\nmoving to a different cell.\nOn July 29, 2ol9, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of\nthe July 23, 2ol9 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea.

Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.

The Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedure that requires cellmate assignments for inmates coming\noff of suicide watch. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy mandating that an inmate coming off of\nsuicide watch have a cellmate, but that doing so was “sound correctional judgment.”\n\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that there were knouledge gaps among MCC New York staff\nregarding Epstein’s cellmate requirement, indicating that improved communication with institutional staff\nwould be beneficial. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP implement a requirement that all\ninmates coming off of suicide watch or psychological observation to be assigned cellmates with criteria for\nexceptions based on the particular individual or security considerations, provide guidance for determining\nwhen a cellmate is no longer required, and implement a process for approving, documenting, and\ncommunicating to institutional staff the assignment and removal of cellmates for these inmates.\n\n2. The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide and for\nwhom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan\nfor cellmate re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review found that there was no contingency plan in place to assign Epstein a\nnew cellmate when his then-cellmate was transferred out of MCC New York. Although the failure to assign a\nnew cellmate was due, in part, to SHU staff failing to make required notifications and supervisory staff\nfailing to adequate supervise SHU staff, the gap in cellmate assignment was also due to the lack of a\ncontingency plan. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew that Epstein\nneeded a new cellmate, he said that SHU staff did not have the authority to assign a new cellmate, which\nwas consistent with what MCC New York supervisory personnel told the OIG. A contingency plan, such as a\nlist of alternate cellmates, would have increased the likelihood that Epstein would not have been housed\nalone at the time of his death. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP develop contingency plans for\ncellmate assignment for high-risk inmates with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or\nsecurity considerations.\n\n3. The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting approval\nfor social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the\nprocess, and provide guidance on standard components that each institution should\ninclude in its process to mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on\nsuicide watch or psychological observation.\n\nAccording to the BOP’s Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Program Policy Statement 5324.o8 and the MCC New York\nInstitution Supplement to the suicide <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> policy, inmates on suicide watch must be under constant\nobservation by staff or trained inmate observers. The MCC New York Institution Supplement policy states\nthat only with rare exceptions that are approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Warden of\nPrograms will visitation either social or legal be permited for inmates on suicide watch.

According to the Psychological\nReconstruction conducted by the Assistant Director of the Reentry Services Division, during Epstein’s\npsychological observation on July 24 through July 3o, 2ol9, Epstein was also alloued to visit with his\natorneys between 8-ll hours each day without direct observation. Although the MCC New York\nsupplemental policy described an approval process for social and legal visits while an inmate is on suicide\nwatch or psychological observation, the OIG found no evidence that Epstein’s legal visits were approved by\nthe Captain or an Associate Warden. Additionally, the BOP Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Program Policy Statement\n5324.o8 does not describe any process or procedures that allous an inmate to have legal or social visits\nwhile on suicide watch or psychological observation. The OIG therefore recommends that the BOP evaluate\nits current process for such visits to be approved and documented.\n\n4. The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts and\nwellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed many inmate accountability deficiencies. Most fundamentally,\nMCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, did not conduct many of the required\nrounds and inmate counts. Additionally, there was lacking or delayed documentation regarding inmates,\nincluding cell assignments and internal inmate transfers. Internal reports, such as the daily call out list and\nthe Lieutenant log, are either not retained or subject to continuous modification, which reduces their utility\nas accountability tools. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its methods of accounting\nfor inmate whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as appropriate to improve those methods\nthrough policy, training, or other measures.\n\n5. BOP policy should clarify what is required of a Lieutenant when conducting a round.\n\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed significant gaps in the supervision of MCC New York staff\nassigned to the SHU. Although BOP policy requires MCC New York Lieutenants to conduct at least one\nround in the SHU during each shift, what was required of a Lieutenant during the round is not specified.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, experienced MCC New York supervisory personnel described what\nshould be done during a round, which is also reflected in BOP Lieutenant training, but this expectation was\nnot memorialized in any BOP or MCC New York policy or Post Order. The OIG recommends that the BOP\ndevelop a policy, either at an agency-wide or institution-specific level, to define what is expected of\nsupervisory personnel during a round in the SHU to beter ensure that BOP staff are\nappropriately supervised.\n\nll2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23479\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024128.jpg": "Date of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE\nEncounter Date: o7/o6/2ol9 2l:38 Provider: a Facility: NYM\nMental Health:\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and Oriented\nPsychomotor Activity: Normal\nGeneral Appearance: Normal\nBehavior: Cooperative\nMood: Appropriate to Content\nThought Process: Goal Directed\nThought Content: Normal\nHx of Mental Health Treatment: None\nHx of Head Injury: None\nCurrent Mental Health Treatment: No\nCurrent Mental Health Complaint: No\nHx of Loss of Consciousness: No\nHx of Hearing Voices: No\nPast History of Suicide Atempt: No\nCurrent Suicide Ideation: No\nSuicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Initiated:No\nComments:\nSubstance Use History: Denied\nCurrent Painful Condition: Denied\nOther Health Issues:\nCurrent Medical Conditions:\nOther Current Treatments:\nPregnant: N/A\nDental Condition: Denied\nGenerated o7/o6/2ol9 2l:56 arg Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 3 of 6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024135.jpg": "Inmate Name: EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD Reg #: 763l8-o54\nDate of Birth: ol/2o/l953 Sex: M Race: WHITE Facility: NYM\nEncounter Date: o7/o9/2ol9 l2:35 Provider: ae Unit: HOl\nMental Health:\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and Oriented\nPsychomotor Activity: Normal\nGeneral Appearance: Normal\nBehavior: Cooperative\nMood: Appropriate to Content\nThought Process: Goal Directed\nThought Content: Normal\nHx of Mental Health Treatment: None\nHx of Head Injury: None\nCurrent Mental Health Treatment: No\nCurrent Mental Health Complaint: No\nHx of Loss of Consciousness: No\nHx of Hearing Voices: No\nPast History of Suicide Atempt: No\nCurrent Suicide Ideation: No\nSuicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Initiated:No\nComments:\nSubstance Use History: Denied\nCurrent Painful Condition: Denied\nOther Health Issues:\nCurrent Medical Conditions:\nOther Current Treatments:\nPregnant: N/A\nDental Condition: Denied\nGenerated o7/o9/2ol9 l3:o3 ON ee Bureau of Prisons - NYM Page 3 of l3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo24l35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024819.jpg": "Page 28l\n| Foe\noS U.S. Department of Justice\nENS Federal Bureau of Prisons\nReentry Services Division\nWashington, DC 2o534\nFy\nSEP 4 ¢ 2ol9\nMEMORANDUM FOR J.

Rounds:\nSHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within\nthe policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a\ndaily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets\nwill be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds.

These rounds are to be\nconducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 4o minutes apart. All observations must be documented.\nCloser observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre\nbehavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take\nmore security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate.

Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2ol9\" —\nIn an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement\nrepeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk\nfactors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense.

This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY.

The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds.

The Morning Watch Lieutenant is\nresponsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants\nLog.\nIn order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due\nto the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along\nwith a SENTRY PP3o Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish beter oversight over inmate\naccountability.\nCorrectional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day\nwatch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as\nprescribed by the Captain.

Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.

Houever, the\nsign-in sheets for this training are nou be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is\nassigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the\nChief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide <span class=\"highlight\">Prevention</span> Training.\nSHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter, A representative from\nPsychology will provide the required suicide <span class=\"highlight\">prevention</span> training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will\nbe completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be alloted time during that day to\ncomplete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not\nreceived the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to atend another training day as\nassigned by the Captain.\nStaff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmate’s behavior. Blank log books will be\nmaintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2\" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence\nimmediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a\nblank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each\nlog book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall\nbe clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are\nmade.\nDuring some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In\nthis instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant\nvisual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual\nobservation (yellou). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion\nlog book every 6o minutes.\nLights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will\nmake rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,\neating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not\nprescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.\nThe inmate will be outfited in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive matress.\nand if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate\nCompanions are not alloued to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them\nfrom maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on\nsuicide watch.\nl2. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the\nstaff realignment during fiscal year 2ol8.
