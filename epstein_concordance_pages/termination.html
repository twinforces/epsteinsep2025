The policy applies âwhenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> on the merits after jeopardy has atached.â\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acostaâs flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acostaâs conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epsteinâs conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victimsâ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcostaâs decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the âbestâ result that potentially could\nhave been obtained.

Acostaâs Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act.

To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyerâs ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7].

The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyerâs disclosure. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyerâs\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation.

Similarly, the lawyer must also consider his or her duties of\nloyalty and competence. (See rules l.7 and l.l.)\nOther exceptions to confidentiality under California law\n[l3] This rule is not intended to augment, diminish, or preclude any other exceptions\nto the duty to preserve information protected by Business and Professions Code section\n6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognized under California law.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll42o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 22l of 257 3o55\nLCKCmax9 Charge\n\nl Ms. Maxwell had such an interest, that is a factor which you\n\n2 may properly consider in determining whether or not she was a\n\n3 member of the conspiracy charged in the indictment.\n\n4 Once a conspiracy is formed, it is presumed to\n\n5 continue until either its objective is accomplished or there is\n6 some affirmative act of <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> by the members.

USAM Â§ 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!Â°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM Â§ 9-2.o3l, âDual and Successive Prosecution Policy (âPetite Policyâ),â which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutorâs exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies âwhenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> on the merits after jeopardy has atached.â\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v.

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acostaâs flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acostaâs conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epsteinâs conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victimsâ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcostaâs decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the âbestâ result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acostaâs Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Courtâs concerns about the âpotential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,â the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM Â§ 9-2.o3l (âThis policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.â). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a âsubstantial federal interestâ\nexists, âthe result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,â and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when âthe prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.â\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafiaâs assessment\nof these statutes as âexhaustive,â and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epsteinâs crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\nâfederal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.â329\n\nNevertheless, as Epsteinâs team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that âthe facts had goten beter for Epstein,â Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*âÂ° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI âhad very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.â Villafafia then proposed that the FBI âre-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.âÂ°?â Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, â[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification letersâthere simply was nothing to update.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victimâs atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to âsmearâ victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about âterminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.â\nEpsteinâs atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, âOne girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.â See Julie Broun, âPerversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

Specifically, the decision may not be based on\nconsideration of the personâs race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,\nor beliefs; the prosecutorâs âoun personal feelingsâ about the person or the victim; or the possible\neffect of the decision on the prosecutorâs oun professional or personal circumstances. When\nopting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision\nare communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM Â§ 9-27.27o.\n\n2. USAM Â§ 9-2.o3l: The Petite Policy\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and\nfederal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the\nDepartment has a long-standing policy, knoun as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions\ncharged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar\nconduct.!Â°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set\nforth in USAM Â§ 9-2.o3l, âDual and Successive Prosecution Policy (âPetite Policyâ),â which\ncontains guidelines for a federal prosecutorâs exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring\na federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or\nfederal proceeding. The policy applies âwhenever there has been a prior state or federal\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> on the merits after jeopardy has atached.â\n\nIn circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new\nfederal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follous:\n\n(l) The mater must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether\n\na substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Maters\nl92 See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S. 22, 27-29 (l977); Petite v. United States, 36l U.S. 529 (l96o).\nl22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023208.tif": "successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epsteinâs missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acostaâs flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acostaâs conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epsteinâs conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victimsâ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcostaâs decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the âbestâ result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acostaâs Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Courtâs concerns about the âpotential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,â the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM Â§ 9-2.o3l (âThis policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.â). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a âsubstantial federal interestâ\nexists, âthe result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,â and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when âthe prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.â\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafiaâs assessment\nof these statutes as âexhaustive,â and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epsteinâs crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023259.tif": "âfederal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.ââ??Â°\n\nNevertheless, as Epsteinâs team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that âthe facts had goten beter for Epstein,â Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*âÂ° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI âhad very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.â Villafafia then proposed that the FBI âre-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.â*?â  Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, â[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification letersâthere simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.â\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?8 The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a âstandard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.â These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as âcurrently under investigationâ and noted that â[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.â The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, âJeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,â Palm Beach Daily News âThe Shiny\nSheet,â Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epsteinâs atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victimâs atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to âsmearâ victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about âterminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.â\nEpsteinâs atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, âOne girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.â See Julie Broun, âPerversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,â Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\n327 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epsteinâs June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023778.tif": "BP-AO66L.ol2 NCIC CHECK corrm\nMAR 99 ,\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\nAUTHORIZATION POR RELEASE OF INFORMATION\nNCIC (National Crime Information Center} CHECK\n\nI hereby authorize a representative of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to ebtain any\ninformation on my criminal history background.

As my clients case seems to lend itself to misunderstandings and\nmiscommunications by others, | thought it important to clarify some facts assumed in error.\n| have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the follouing: Yes <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span> of supervision ona\nsex offender is unusual, houever a modification to probation from Community control is not uncommon when\nthe probationer has been in compliance without violation. In fact the department's current policy on re-entry\nto the community dictates that an offender be stepped doun as soon as possible. He was also under the\nmisimpression, as others might have been, that Epsteinâs charges called for sex offender probation. They do\nnot, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues in my clients case, sterile questions that may\nhave been asked tend to lead to answers that though well meaning are not applicable.\nAs for the timeliness of the police reports of the atempted breakins, | wanted you to be aware that | confirmed\nwith Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to the captain on duty, there should be a\nrecord. | said to you it was my advice to the client that he not file a formal report.\nYou have suggested that to resolve all the issues my client move to transfer his community control and that\nyour office would support his transfer. | appreciate that and spoke to Mr. Gaines about that and he doesnât\nbelieve that would be possible to New York.

As my clients case seems to lend itself to\nmisunderstandings and miscommunications by others, I thought it important to clarify some\nfacts assumed in error.\nI have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the follouing: Yes <span class=\"highlight\">termination</span>\nof supervision on a sex offender is unusual, houever a modification to probation from\nCommunity control is not uncommon when the probationer has been in compliance without\nviolation. In fact the departmentâs current policy on re-entry to the community dictates\nthat an offender be stepped doun as soon as possible. He was also under the\nmisimpression, as others might have been, that Epsteinâs charges called for sex offender\nprobation. They do not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues\nin my clients case, sterile questions that may have been asked tend to lead to answers\nthat though well meaning are not applicable.\nAs for the timeliness of the police reports of the atempted breakins, I wanted you to be\naware that I confirmed with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to\nthe captain on duty, there should be a record.
