Relevant Background Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\n<span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001801.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page l of 4\n.)

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\ndisclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997.

Offenses are “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of\nrelated transactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996). By contrast,\noffenses are not “connected” and joinder is inappropriate when “[c]ommission of one of the\noffenses neither depended upon nor necessarily led to the commission of the other; proof of the\none act neither constituted nor depended upon proof of the other.” Halper, 59o F.2d at 429.\n\nSimilarly, offenses that are separated by time and location, and were allegedly commited\nunder different circumstances, are not sufficiently connected to warrant joinder.

Potamitis, 739 F.2d 784 (2d Cir. l984), joinder is not\nappropriate when the perjury or false statement allegations do not relate to, or have only a\nspeculative connection to, the other charges in the indictment.

There is no allegation that Ms. Maxwell continued\nconspiring with Epstein, or engaged in any misconduct at all, in the intervening time period. In\nfact, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell in connection with the investigation that led to\nEpstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement in 2oo7, or in its 2ol9 indictment of Epstein, which\ncharged Epstein with sex trafficking offenses from 2oo2-2oo5. Joinder is improper when the\noffenses are separated by such a significant time period and do not relate to each other. See\nMartinez, l993 WL 322768, at *8-*9 (joinder of firearm possession and narcotics conspiracy\ncounts improper under Rule 8(a) where firearm was seized in different location over four months\nafter narcotics conspiracy ended “under circumstances having no bearing on either the alleged\nnarcotics conspiracy, or any of [defendant’s] coconspirators”); Broun, 2oo8 WL l6ll46, at *5\n(joinder improper under Rule 8(a) where a firearm possession count was <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> “both\nphysically and temporally” to narcotics counts in indictment (emphasis original)).\n\nThe Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts are also not “parts of a common scheme or\nplan.” Fed.

Such cases typically involve situations where the defendant was aware that he\nwas being investigated and either lied to the grand jury or made false statements to law\nenforcement officers in an effort to thwart the existing investigation into the other offenses with\nwhich he was charged. See, e.g., id. at 789-9o (joinder of perjury, false statements, and\nobstruction of justice counts proper where defendant made false statements to FBI agents and\nperjured himself in the grand jury); see also id. at 79l (collecting cases).\n\nHere, the circumstances are very different and joinder is not appropriate. The\ngovernment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell lied to the grand jury or the FBI to derail its\ninvestigation into the conduct underlying the Mann Act Counts. Instead, it alleges that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements in two depositions in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> civil defamation action which\noccurred in April and July 2ol6. Moreover, although the government alleges that some of the\nquestions posed at the depositions related to some of the alleged victims in this case (Indictment\n{| 2, 8), the questions were tangential to the defamation action, which was based on Ms.\nMaxwell’s denial of a purported conspiracy with Epstein from l999-2oo2 involving Ms. Giuffre.\nThe alleged false statements underlying the Perjury Counts therefore do not “concern” the Mann\nAct Counts and cannot be joined as part of a “common scheme or plan.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at\n79l.\n\nThe government makes only a half-hearted, and ineffective, atempt to allege a\nconnection between the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts sufficient to satisfy Rule 8(a).\nParagraph 2 of the Indictment alleges:\n\n[I]n an effort to conceal her crimes, MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned\n\nabout her conduct, including in relation to some of the minor victims described\n\nherein, when providing testimony under oath in 2ol6.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo229o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Pagel7l of 239\ntherein. See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at ll9o-9l (joining counts involving use of businesses to\ncommit fraud with a count of falsely swearing in bankruptcy court that the defendant “had not\nengaged in any business activity during the preceding six years”).°? Accordingly, and consistent\nwith the holdings in Ruiz and Broccolo, this Court should deny the severance motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that the offenses are not connected because they involve different\ntime periods. To be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct involving certain victims from\nl994 to l997, while the perjury counts charge statements made in 2ol6 in a case conceming\nGiuffre’s abuse from l999 to 2oo2. Houever, the specific statements charged in Count Five and\nCount Six directly relate to the conduct charged in Counts One through Four, including, in one\ninstance, a specific victim identified as relevant to those counts. And those statements were not\ntime-bound or restricted to Giuffre. For instance, the defendant denied the existence of any scheme\nto recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not the existence of such a scheme between l999\nand 2oo2, or a scheme specifically focused on Giuffre. The defendant also denied ever giving\nanyone a massage, specifically including Epstein and Minor Victim-2. She did not limit her denial\nto Giuffre or to a particular time period. There is, accordingly, a strong connection between the\ntruth or falsity of the defendant’s broad denials and her acts in the period at issue in the substantive\ncounts. The cases on which the defendant relies are factually inapposite and do not support her\nargument, because they involve wholly <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> events. See, e.g., United States v. Halper, 59o\nF.2d 422, 43l (2d Cir. l978) (severing a Medicaid fraud indictment from a tax evasion indictment\nwhere the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation of people he had employed—different\n°3 While the defendant may argue that the fact that her deposition, unlike Ruiz, did not involve\ncriminal authorities counsels in favor of a different outcome, as discussed further belou, the\nprospect of a criminal prosecution was nonetheless plainly on her mind at the time of the\ndepositions, as evidenced by the myriad arguments she herself makes in support of her motions to\nsuppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena to Boies Schiller. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4, Def.\nMot. ll at 2).\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003107.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 239\n\nin bankruptcy proceeding). And the cases the defendant cites in which a perjury or false statements\ncount was severed only underscore this point. In both cases, the statement itself concerned an\nentirely different subject mater, provable through largely if not entirely different evidence. See\nUnited States v. Boti, No. o8 Cr. 23o (CSH), 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *l, *5 (D. Conn. Sept. 25,\n2oo9) (severing a structuring conspiracy and false statements related to that conspiracy from a\n“separate” corruption conspiracy); United States v. Mitan, No. o8-76o, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3\n(E.D. Pa. July 28, 2oo9) (severing counts charging a fraud scheme from perjury count for an\naffidavit submited as part of a bail motion, which “was not as an atempt to cover up the scheme\nto defraud, but rather an atempt to shou that Court had erred” in its bail decision).\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that the counts are <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> because the defendant’s\ntestimony was given in response to questions “tangential to the defamation action,” and her\nanswers “concealed” no crimes because they were “true and reflective of the poor questioning by\nthe plaintiff's lawyers.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8-9). The defendant is free to make at least some of these\narguments to the jury, but these assertions are not a lawful basis for severing Counts Five and Six.\nThis is merely an atempt to refashion the defendant’s claim that she gave truthful, immaterial\nanswers to ambiguous questions. But, as discussed in detail in Section V, those arguments have\nno merit.\n\nThird, the defendant has failed to carry her heavy burden under Rule l4(a) to shou\nprejudice. At the outset, “[t]he contention that there is some inherent prejudice in joining perjury\nand related counts with substantive charges has been widely rejected.” Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 79l.\nAnd courts routinely hold that there is no prejudice where the evidence in support of the two counts\nis “interconnected.” Blakney, 94l F.2d at ll6; see Carson, 464 F.2d at 436 (“[T]he commonality\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3lo7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003118.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l84 of 239\nagainst her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant\nis charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,\nspecifically, violations of New York Penal Law § l3o.55. Indictment 4 ll(b), l3, l7(b), l9. The\ndefendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding hou\nthe defendant commited the charged crimes, the Government is somehou required to provide\neven more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,\nand where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the essential elements of each\ncrime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as\na mater of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.\nVIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment\n\nThe defendant moves to strike any reference to Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment,\nclaiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-\n3 are <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the\nallegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is\nbaseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions\nwith Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor\nvictims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately\ntransported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to engage in criminal conduct;\nthere is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-\n3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged\nconspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can\nencompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the\n\nl57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3ll8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003199.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23 of 348\nA.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”! In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33lo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7o of 348\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003419.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*\"? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.7! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO.

Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill.

The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Unrelated</span> to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime.

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2s EQOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a\nlawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a\nwitness. N.Y. R. Prof?] Conduct § 3.7(a).. Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the\ndeposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not\nrequired to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3698", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page6ofl7\n\nA. The Counts are Dissimilar and Illogically and Artificially Connected.\n\nThe government claims that the Perjury Counts are properly joined because they are\n“logically connected” to the Mann Act Counts and part of the same “common plan or scheme.”\nResp. at l38, l4l, l43. No logic can be gleaned from the government’s response. Offenses are\nor “connected” or part of a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grou out of related\ntransactions.” United States v. Randazzo, 8o F.3d 623, 627 (lst Cir. l996).\n\nHere, the Perjury Counts did not “grou out of” the conduct underlying the Mann Act\nCounts. Ms. Maxwell’s depositions occurred in 2ol6, twenty years after the conduct alleged in\nthe Mann Act Counts purportedly occurred from l994-l997. Furthermore, the allegations\nunderlying the two sets of counts are <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span>. The “scheme” alleged in the Indictment is the\nalleged enticement of three females to travel for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts\nbetween l994 and l997. The depositions at the heart of the Perjury Counts concerned the truth or\nfalsity of Virginia Giuffre’s “obvious lies” about being sexually trafficked to famous people and\nher purported four years as a sex slave. None of the Accusers in the Indictment claim to have\nbeen sexually trafficked by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell to anyone, let alone any famous people.\n\nAnd the defamation case had nothing to do with any allegations by Ms. Giuffre of being enticed\nto travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Hou Ms. Maxwell’s answers to questions in 2ol6 about\nthe falsity of Ms. Giuffre’s sex trafficking claims (years after the allegations in the Indictment)\nare related to the conspiracies alleged in the Indictment is therefore a mystery.!\n\n' There is also no evidence that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein conspired or agreed to lie in the\ndefamation case. After Ms. Maxwell compelled Epstein to sit for a deposition in the defamation action, he\nasserted his right against self-incrimination and declined to answer any questions. Ms. Maxwell, having\ncommited no crime and not being a part of any conspiracy with Epstein, chose to answer questions\ntruthfully. No charges were pending against either Epstein or Ms. Maxwell at the time of the depositions\nand there was no relationship between the two individuals.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page/7ofl7\n\nThe government also asserts, without explanation, that the Perjury Counts are of “similar\ncharacter” to the Mann Act Counts. Resp. l4l. “Similar character,” for purposes of F.R.E. 8(a)\n“means nearly corresponding, resembling in many respects or having a general likeness.” United\nStates v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922 (2d Cir. l98o). The alleged perjury in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> defamation\ncase more than 2o years after the fact bears no likeness to allegedly enticing someone to travel\nfor an illegal sexual purpose.\n\nB. The Perjury Charges Do Not “Concern” the Mann Act Offenses.\n\nNor do the Perjury Counts “concern” the Mann Act Counts as claimed by the\ngovernment. Resp. l43. The government cites the supposedly “setled law in this Circuit that\njoinder of ‘underlying substantive crimes with perjury counts’ is appropriate ‘where . . . the false\ndeclarations concern the substantive offenses.”” Jd. (citing United States v. Potamitis, 739 F.2d\n784, 79l (2d Cir. l984)). But it is wrong on both the facts and the law.\n\nThe cases cited by the government involve a distinct fact patern: the defendant allegedly\nmade a materially false statement that relates directly to the underlying crime and the crime is\ntemporally related to the false statement. The Potamitis case that the government relies upon\nprimarily for this proposition is a good example. In that case, the defendant was charged with\nmaking false statements to FBI agents, commiting perjury before the grand jury, and obstruction\nof justice because he lied to the FBI agents and the Grand Jury about the underlying crimes for\nwhich he was being investigated and questioned. Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 786-87; see also United\nStates v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol (2d Cir. l992) (common plan or scheme between lying on a non-\nprofit’s loan application and perjury during grand jury investigation the subsequent year into that\nsame non-profit); United States v. Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. ll85 at ll9o-9l (S.D.N.Y. l992)\n(fraud in businesses joined with false swearing to bankruptcy court about operating that same\nbusiness); United States v. Sweig, 44l F.2d ll4 (2d Cir. l97l) (perjury in grand jury\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page8ofl7\ninvestigating the underlying charged conspiracy); United States v. Cohn, 23o F. Supp. 587\n(S.D.N.Y. l964) (perjury during grand jury proceedings into the same transaction as substantive\ncount); United States v. Harris, 8o5 F. Supp. l66 (S.D.N.Y. l992) (severing false statement\nregarding a personal loan from substantive counts of inducing a consortium of banks to provide\ncredit to companies controlled by defendant).\n\nThe facts of this case do not fit the supposed well-setled Second Circuit rule, because the\nPerjury Counts do not involve any allegedly materially false testimonial statements to law\nenforcement authorities, a grand jury, a petit jury, or a court considering the purportedly criminal\nacts in question. Nor did the allegedly false statements concern the Mann Act Counts, which are\nbased on allegations of enticing women to travel in interstate commerce for an illegal sexual\npurpose between l994 and l997. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to questions about, for example,\nwhether she could give a list of people under the age of l8 who came to Epstein’s house or\nwhether she could identify sex toys—which she made in the context of a 2ol6 defamation claim\nbrought by an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> person—do not “concern” the Mann Act Counts.\n\nThe government contends that the fact that Ms. Maxwell made these statements in the\ncontext of a civil deposition, as opposed to a criminal investigation, “is of litle moment” because\nshe was supposedly “concerned about the prospect of a criminal investigation at the time of her\ndepositions.” Resp. at l45. That is simply wrong. What Ms. Maxwell, and her lawyers were\n“concerned about” was the abuse of her deposition testimony by unscrupulous lawyers. As it\nturns out, her concern was entirely justified.’\n\n* See, e.g., htps://www.npr.org/2o2o/o3/l2/8o4949o55/the-new-york-times-the-unreliable-\nsource-and-the-expos-that-missed-the-mark;\nhtps://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2ol7/ll/weinstein-boies/545273/.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 _ Filed o4/2o/2l Pageloofl7\nguilt or should be so incredible that its very implausibility suggests that it was created to conceal\nguilt.” United States vy. Litlefield, 84o F.2d l43, l49 (lst Cir. l988) (internal citations and\nquotations omited). That is not the case here. Moreover, the government cites no case where a\npurportedly false response in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> civil deposition was admissible as a false exculpatory\nstatement in a criminal case. Accordingly, the Perjury Counts should be severed and tried\nseparately.*\n\nII. The Perjury Counts Must Be Severed to Prevent the Introduction of\n\nImproper, Highly Prejudicial, and Inadmissible Evidence.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l4(a), captioned “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder,”\nconfers upon a trial court the discretion to sever even properly joined counts if “justice requires.”\nThe rule provides, in pertinent part: “If the joinder of offenses ...in an indictment . . . appears\nto prejudice a defendant or the government, the court may order separate trials of counts . . . or\nprovide any other relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l4(a).\n\nThere can be litle doubt that if the Perjury Counts are not severed, Ms. Maxwell will\nsuffer substantial prejudice. The government’s proof of the Mann Act Counts will come almost\nexclusively from the testimony of the three accusers, with litle or no independent documentary\ncorroboration. Adding the Perjury Counts, which involve allegations of sexual abuse by another\nalleged victim that are <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the charged crimes, will create a significant risk that the jury\nwill impermissibly use the evidence introduced in connection with the Perjury Counts “to infer a\ncriminal disposition” on the part of Ms. Maxwell to commit the Mann Act violations, or might\n> Tt is highly unlikely that two trials would occur in this mater. Should the case proceed to trial on Counts\nl-4, only, a conviction would expose Ms. Maxwell to a significant term of imprisonment. Under the\nsentencing guidelines, the Court would be permited to consider any severed perjury counts under a\nnumber of theories including | grouping] or 2l U.S.C. § 3553(a). No second trial would be necessary. If\nMs. Maxwell were acquited, issue-preclusion would bar any second trial. See Yeager v. United States,\n557 U.S. llo, l2l-l22 (2oo9).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel2ofl7\ne = The Giuffre v.

Scot, 677 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir.\n2ol2). In evaluating F.R.E. 4o4(b) evidence, the Court must consider whether: (l) it is offered for a\nproper purpose; (2) it is relevant to a material issue in dispute; and (3) its probative value is substantially\noutweighed by its prejudicial effect....” LaFlam, 369 F.3d at l56. There is no proper purpose for the\nadmission of any of the alleged perjury which occurred decades after the charges in Counts l-4. Certainly,\nthe government has articulated none. Ms. Maxwell’s answers to the vague and objectionable questions\nselectively plucked from hundreds of pages of transcripts have no relevance to any material issue related\nto the Mann Act Counts. And, significantly, any arguable probative value is substantially outweighed by\nits prejudicial effect.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o9", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document224 Filed o4/2o/2l Pagel5ofl7\none or more of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers should become actual witnesses, a circumstance that\nwould create a circus, not a fair trial.\n\nThe truth of the mater is simple: the government included the Perjury Counts because it\nwants to call Ms. Maxwell a liar in front of the jury and because it wanted a way to introduce\n<span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span>, but extremely prejudicial evidence of alleged sexual abuse through the back door.

See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at lo9 (explaining\nthat Rule l7(c) is not appropriate for evidence that is “otherwise procurable” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). BSF represents that “all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater.” (3/22/2l Leter from BSF, Dkt. No.\nl9l at 5). The Government also obtained and produced seven pages of the diary to the defendant\nin discovery. (Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. l48 at lo).\n\nThe defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference\nto her. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2\nhave acknouledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2\nis expected to testify to that fact at trial. (See Gov’t Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87 (citing\nMem. in Opp. to Def.’s Renewed Motion for Release, Dkt. No. loo at ll n.2.); 3/22/2l Leter from\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5). The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and\nproduce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 2o7 at 29).\nAs the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that\nMinor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no\nentries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t\nOmnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87). The victim provided the Government with her entries\nrelating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.). The remainder\nof the diary consists of Minor Victim-2’s <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> personal diary entries, and the defendant has\nnot explained and cannot explain why she needs to review those entries to establish a fact that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o96", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page4of9\nPage 4\n\nGovernment has acknouledged. In other words, there will be no dispute at trial that Minor Victim-\n2 did not write about the defendant in her diary.!\n\nThe cases the defendant cites are inapposite. For instance, in United States v. Cheung Kin\nPing, 555 F.2d lo69 (2d Cir. l977), the parties learned that a cooperating witness kept a diary,\nwhich was largely writen in Chinese, while the witness was still on cross-examination. /d. at\nlo78. The witness turned over his diary, but after observing that the “defense was examining his\ndiary, .. . he requested that this not be done.” /d. While the parties were discussing hou to review\nthe diary, including for Brady material, the diary was returned to the witness. It was only given to\nthe defense for examination after “roughly five days” in the witness’s possession. /d. at lo79.\nAccordingly, in that case, a diary that had never been evaluated for Brady material—or any other\nmaterial—was taken from a witness in the middle of the witness’s cross-examination, then\nreturned to him for five days. The Second Circuit found that those events “created a serious risk\nthat significant material would be destroyed or tampered with.” /d. Here, in contrast, the diary\ncontains no relevant material—in fact, that is the defendant’s very thesis. See also White v.\nMcKinley, 5l9 F.3d 8o6, 8l4 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (explaining, in a § l983 case, that the plaintiff had\nalleged bad faith by stating that a law enforcement officer in a child molestation case “deliberately\nsteer[ed] the investigation to benefit his love interest,” in part by “‘fail[ing] to preserve the alleged\nvictim’s diary which did not corroborate the molestation allegations,” which in turn “deprived [the\ndefendant] of his right to a fair trial, in part, because he could not testify about the diary without\nwaiving his right not to testify”); United States v.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7l of 349\nconsidered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4493", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 244 of 349\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three victims\nwere notified shortly after the signing of the [NPA] of the general\nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim\nnotification, and no further notifications were done. Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°?! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n32l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 255 of 349\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN <span class=\"highlight\">UNRELATED</span>\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Unrelated</span> to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.’\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, Jn re Dean, holding that a victim’s\noe The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4552", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004611.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l4 of 349\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nes EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004720.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document295_ Filed o5/25/2l Page l3 of 26\nMichigan, 568 U.S. 3l3, 3l9 (2ol3) (distinguishing between a “merits-related ruling” during trial\nthat “concludes proceedings absolutely” under the Double Jeopardy Clause and “termination of\nthe proceedings . . . on a basis <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to factual guilt or innocence of the offense” (internal\nquotation marks omited)). In order for jeopardy to atach to counts dismissed pursuant to a plea\nagreement, the dismissal must involve some adjudication of facts that go to the merits. For\ninstance, “a plea agreement in which the court was directly involved in a defendant’s decision to\nplead guilty to two counts, in exchange for an agreement to drop with prejudice a third count, all\non the basis of findings of certain facts which support that agreement, might perhaps constitute a\npretrial fact-finding that implicated jeopardy in its proper sense of risk of exposure.” Dionisio,\n5o3 F.3d at 84 (footnote omited).\n\nHere, the defendant was never placed in jeopardy in the United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Florida.

At no point did the defendant even risk conviction.\n\nThat analysis is unaffected by the NPA. Again, neither the defendant nor Epstein was ever\nindicted by a grand jury siting in the Southern District of Florida nor found guilty of any federal\noffense.

Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered.

This\n\npresents a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence\n\nof the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered\n\nseparately, it would not do so.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 389 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page7ofil\n\nSecond, any evidence of alleged false statements, whether it is introduced as direct\nevidence of the perjury counts or as evidence of a purported effort to “conceal” the other crimes\ncharged in the superseding indictment, would substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell and would\njeopardize her right to a fair trial for the same reasons the Court identified in its severance ruling.\nAllouing the jury to consider evidence related to the perjury counts “would introduce <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span>\nallegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the jury to evidence that might\notherwise not be admissible . . . [and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation\nagainst Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24. This would present\n“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd.

See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nSeparate and apart from the Court’s prior ruling, the government has not established a\nsufficient connection between the alleged false statements and the alleged sex abuse offenses to\nintroduce the statements as evidence of concealment of the later. The alleged false statements\nwere made at <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> civil depositions in 2ol6, over 2o years after the conduct underlying the\nMann Act offenses supposedly took place, at a time when Ms. Maxwell was not under\ninvestigation. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell was never a subject of the Palm Beach FBI investigation\nthat concluded in 2oo8 and was not named as a co-conspirator in Epstein’s Non-Prosecution\nAgreement that resolved that investigation. Hence, there is no sound basis to assert that Ms.\nMaxwell made false statements to conceal her involvement in Epstein’s crimes.\n\nFurthermore, the superseding indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell’s purported\nfalse statements were the result of an agreement with Epstein to conceal their alleged conduct or\nwere otherwise part of, or an object of, the conspiracies charged in the non-perjury counts.\nInstead, the superseding indictment alleges that the purported false statements were part of a\nseparate and independent effort by Ms. Maxwell to conceal her alleged involvement in Epstein’s\nsex abuse offenses long after those offenses had already been completed. Accordingly, the\nstatements are not sufficiently connected to the non-perjury counts to allou this evidence to be\nintroduced as proof of concealment of those offenses. See United States v.

O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money\nto the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her charitable works or evidence of her family history. Such\nevidence should be excluded as irrelevant, confusing, and prejudicial.\n\nAs discussed above, the Federal Rules of Evidence preclude the use of good acts to draw\na propensity inference in favor of the defendant, just as they preclude the use of prior bad acts for\nthe same purpose. See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF. App’x 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (“The district court correctly recognized that\nevidence of solitary confinement could be used for the improper purpose of provoking juror\nsympathy.”). Any atempt to encourage such sympathy is therefore an atempt at nullification,\nwhich is itself plainly improper. See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, ll6 F.3d 6o6, 6l5 (2d Cir.\nl997) (Jury nullification is “by no means a right or something that a judge should encourage or\npermit if it is within his authority to prevent.”); id. at 6l4 (“We categorically reject the idea that,\nin a society commited to the rule of law, jury nullification is desirable or that courts may permit\nit to occur when it is within their authority to prevent.”); see also United States v.

The defendants are cautioned, houever, that\n\nevidence of good conduct that does not refute evidence of the offense charged will\n\nnot be admited.\n\nId. at *2. Thus, the court properly excluded evidence — <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to the charged conspiracy — of\nthe defendant's \"good\" propensity, and it also properly reserved for trial the admissibility of\n\"evidence of good conduct ... relevant to the charged conduct\" or as \"may be necessary to\nprevent misleading the jury.\" Here, too, evidence that the purported conspiracies operated\nwithout the knouledge or participation of Ms. Maxwell during the period charged amounts to\ndirect evidence that the conspiratorial agreement or knouledge of the objectives likewise did not\nexist. Only after the government has made its opening statements and put on its evidence will\nthe defense even knou, much less be in a position to argue, what contrary evidence will be\noffered.

Bennet and W. O’Donobue\ngym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this\ndefinition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators\nto groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to\ngain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). Houever, because this behav-\nior can be entirely <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to abuse and because the assessment ought to\nstrive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-\ning behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize\nthat not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an\nadult offering cigaretes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we\nnarrou the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to\nincreasing the probability of sexual contact.\n\nIt is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-\nable behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.\nFor example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-\nsidered inappropriate. Unless more details are knoun about the context of\nthis purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other\nfemale to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could\nexplicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-\ntive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this\nbehavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be\nconsidered grooming.\n\nArguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of\nthe definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to\nincrease the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the\nintentions of a person performing a behavior is admitedly complex. The\nrational appraisal of behavior involves seting up a universe of plausible\ninterpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or\nrule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a\nbikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into\nthe bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and\nhaving her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-\nsidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the\nset of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior\ninclude:\n\nl. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allou the child to engage\nin the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the\nonly way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These\nfacts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.\n\n2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate\nas there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis\ncan be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a\nguardian present is also a boundary violation.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o).

United States v. Schaffer,\n85l F.3d l66, l82 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“[T]the fact that evidence ‘may be highly prejudicial’ does not\nnecessarily mean that it is ‘unfairly prejudicial.’”).

Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“The\nprobative value [of mental health condition evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will not\nengage in name-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health issues”\nor <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> and irrelevant drug use.

Accordingly, the\ncircumstances of this case do not fall within the narrou categories of implied bias that the Second\nCircuit has recognized.

If the producing party claims that the writing includes\n<span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> mater, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any\n<span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party.\nAny portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.\n(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or\nis not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order.

On l7 July\n2o25, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Atorney General Pam Bondi to seek the\nCourt’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of\nInformation Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/\ngrand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. l9-49o (S.D.N.Y.). We are\nconcerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern\nseemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make\nappropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information\nprior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n\nTo be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not\npertain to that information. Houever, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be\nimplicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,\nsuch as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join\nthe Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrou\nindependent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding\npersonally identifiable information <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to victims.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a\nlawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a\nwitness. N.Y. R. Prof] Conduct § 3.7(a).

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021417.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 343 3536o38, Page245 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 243 of 348\n\ninformed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\n\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\n\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Throughout\n\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\n\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\n\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\n\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\n\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\n\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!” The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.?”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°*! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\na The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO. See Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office Public Records/Jeffrey Epstein, available\nat htp://sal5.org/stateatorney/NewsRoom/indexPR htm.\n\n22l OPR was unable to locate any records indicating that such allegations had ever been referred to OPR.\nVillafafia told OPR that “Catch 22” was a reference to instructions from supervisors “[t]hat we can’t go forward on”\nfiling federal charges and “I was told not to do victim notifications and confer at the time.”\n\n2l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021428.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page256 of 258\nSA-254\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 254 of 348\ncamera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted\nimages that could contain child pornography.*”\n\nBy early April 2oo8, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal\nDivision, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein\nwere “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterban for help to “move this [Criminal\nDivision review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s\ncase by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents\nand the victims” were “losing their patience.”\n\nOn April 24, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior\nasking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had\nexpressed to Oosterban. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN <span class=\"highlight\">UNRELATED</span>\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Unrelated</span> to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l428", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021489.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Paged9 of 2l7\nSA-3l3\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l3 of 348\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDs EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l489", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021842.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ll7, ll/ol/2o24, 3636586, Pagel8 of 5l\nimmunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding\njust one USAO rather than the Government as a whole, “unless it affirmatively\nappears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 77l F.2d at 672.\nAnnabi did not explain or acknouledge its departure from this longstanding doctrine.\n\nThis Court has been exceedingly reluctant, until nou, to affirm a conviction\non the force of Annabi’s reasoning.

Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary shouing in support of the first required prong\nmeans that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,\nBass, 536 US. at 863.\n\nAs to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that\nthe decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a\nshouing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for\nprosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations\nas race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at\n59 (internal quotation marks omited; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any\nevidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything\nother than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at\nall, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is\n“rampant” within the BOP.

Instead, it is self-\nevidently “<span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be\ndecided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.\nRegan, lo3 F.3d at lo82; see also United States v.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”? Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\n7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023182.jpg": "considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\nBs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... Itis\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.jpg": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023255.jpg": "informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\n\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

Throughout\nthis process you have seen that I have prepared this case as though\nit would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility\nof damages claims prior to concluding the mater by plea or trial\nwould only undermine my case. If my reassurances are insufficient\nthe fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein\nshould assure you of the integrity of the investigation.\n\nOn December l4, 2oo7, Villafafia forwarded to Acosta the draft victim notification leter\npreviously sent to the defense, along with two draft leters addressed to State Atorney Krischer;\nVillafafia’s transmital email to Acosta had the subject line, “The leters you requested.” One of\nthe draft leters to Krischer, to be signed by Villafafia, was to advise that the USAO had sent an\nenclosed victim notification leter to specified identified victims and referred to an enclosed “list\nof the identified victims and their contact information, in case you are required to provide them\nwith any further notification regarding their rights under Florida law.”*!? The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> mater]. We seem to be ina Catch 22.”°*!

The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\nDe EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO.

Significant Entities and Individuals\nJeffrey Epstein was born in l953 and, prior to his arrest, worked at various jobs in the financial industry and\nultimately developed considerable wealth. On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\n<span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to this investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates. The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely\nseparated from the general inmate population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per\nday, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\nCorrectional Officer (CO) Tova Noel and Material Handler Michael Thomas began working together in MCC\nNew York SHU at l2 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.4 During their shift, they each created and submited falsified\nofficial BOP forms documenting inmate counts (often referred to as “count slips”), and Noel completed and\nsigned more than 75 separate entries on an official BOP form documenting 3o-minute rounds (often\n* Noel worked her regular shift in the SHU from 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. on August 9, 2ol9, folloued by an overtime shift in the\nSHU from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9.

Epstein’s Arrest and Detention on July 6\nOn July 2, 2ol9, a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York returned a two-\ncount indictment that charged Epstein with commiting sex trafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2, based on allegations that he sexually exploited and\nabused dozens of minor girls, some as young as l4 years old, at his homes in New York and Florida. The\nindictment alleged that from at least 2oo2 through 2oo5, Epstein enticed and recruited girls, many of whom\nhe knew were underage, to visit his homes and perform sex acts in exchange for paying each girl hundreds\nof dollars in cash. The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France. He was transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in\nNew York, New York (MCC New York), where he was initially placed in the general inmate population. MCC\nNew York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). The\nBOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to\nthis investigation. When it was operational, MCC New York housed primarily pretrial detainees who had not\nyet been convicted of any offense, but whom the court had determined under applicable law should remain\nin custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial flight risk,\nor both. Due to the significant media atention surrounding his arrest and his notoriety among other MCC\nNew York inmates, the follouing day Epstein was moved to MCC New York's Special Housing Unit (SHU), a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours per day, to ensure their oun safety as\nwell as the safety of staff and other inmates. On Monday, July 8, 2ol9, Epstein appeared in federal court\nand pleaded not guilty to the charges. The court ordered that Epstein remain in custody pending a\ndetention hearing scheduled for July l5, 2ol9.\nAt the detention hearing, Epstein sought to be placed in home detention at his New York residence with\nelectronic monitoring and other conditions. The prosecutors sought to have Epstein detained at MCC\nNew York pending trial. The court reviewed the parties’ filings and heard argument on the mater of pre-\ntrial release on July l5, 2ol9. On July l8, 2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial. In\nits ruling, the court noted that because Epstein had been indicted for a violation of the federal sex trafficking\nstatute that involved minor victims, there was a presumption in favor of detention under federal law. The\ncourt found that the United States had shoun by clear and convincing evidence that Epstein threatened the\nsafety of another person and of the community based on testimony from two victims, the allegations of\nrepeated sexual abuse of minors, and the lewd photographs of young-looking women or girls that were\nfound during an authorized search of Epstein’s New York residence in July 2ol9. The court also relied on the\nrecommendation of U.S. Pretrial Services, the seriousness of the offenses with which Epstein had been\ncharged, evidence reflecting Epstein’s harassment and intimidation of and tampering with witnesses\ninvolved in a prior Florida state criminal investigation, and Epstein’s lack of compliance with his legal\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23388", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll.

The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he and other staff members did not conduct any cell searches\nduring his shift in the SHU on August 9. Additionally, the OIG determined that there was an excessive\namount of bed linen within Epstein’s cell. The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new equipment for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032057.jpg": "ai\ne 7 ff —— E t ; ecuting the schemes, although. having no __ he reportedly told the grand jury. “It looked\nff tl rey ps ein broker’s license, he had to rely on others to like it was free and clear but it actually\n» ah = make the trades.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!© In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for integrity in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers. OPR found no indication that the Epstein mater was discussed.\nlo8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l46", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023182.tif": "considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring\nEpstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to\nvictims—had been made by July 3l, 2oo7, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the\ndefense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3. Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.tif": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR- ooo232o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023255.tif": "informed victims “of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough investigation of their\n\nallegations against Mr. Epstein”:\nNone of the victims were informed of the right to sue under\nSection 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration. OPR found no evidence that these leters were sent to Krischer.*”°\n\nA few days later, in an apparent effort to move forward with victim notifications, Villafafia\nemailed Sloman, stating, “[Is there] anything that I or the agents should be doing?” Villafafia told\nSloman that “[the FBI case agent] is all worked up because another agent and [a named AUSA]\nare the subject of an OPR investigation for failing to properly confer with and notify victims [in\nan <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> mater]. We seem to be in a Catch 22.”°*! OPR did not find a response to Villafafia’s\nemail.\n\nIn their December l4, 2oo7 meeting with Acosta and other USAO personnel and in their\nlengthy follou-up leter to Acosta on December l7, 2oo7, Starr and Lefkouitz continued to press\ntheir objections to the USAO’s involvement in the Epstein mater. They requested that Acosta\n3l9 The draft victim notification leter was identical to the draft victim notification leter sent to the defense on\nDecember 6, 2oo7, except that it contained a new plea date of January 4, 2oo8.\n\n32o Moreover, the leters were not included in the publicly released State Atorney’s file, which included other\ncorrespondence from the USAO.

Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file\ncharges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the\nagents, and the police officers to decide hou the case will be resolved and to provide them with an\nexplanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its\nreview of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, houever, Villafafia did not file charges that day.\n\nVill. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN <span class=\"highlight\">UNRELATED</span>\n\nMATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION\n\nDuring the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA\nby entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict\nbetween the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights atached upon the filing of a\ncriminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous\ncommunications confirm that in 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy\nregarding the issue.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Unrelated</span> to the Epstein investigation, on April l8, 2oo8, Acosta and Sloman received a\ncitizen complaint from an atorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the\nFlorida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The atorney asserted that the CVRA\nguaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was\nthe victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division\nChief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2oo5 Guidelines, “our obligations\nunder [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2oo8, the Appellate\nDivision Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]\nreading of [the 2oo5 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not\ntriggered until a case is filed.”34°\n\nOn May 7, 2oo8, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, /n re Dean, holding that a victim’s\nae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.\n\n343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the\ninitiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations\nto the victim.\n228\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23266", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023325.tif": "METHODOLOGY\n\nA. Document Review\n\nAs referenced in the Executive Summary, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of\nthousands of pages of documents from the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (USAO), other U.S. Atorney’s offices, the FBI, and other Department components,\nincluding the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive\nOffice for U.S. Atorneys (EOUSA). The categories of documents reviewed by OPR, and their\nsources, are set forth belou.\n\nl. USAO Records\n\nThe USAO provided OPR with access to all of its records from its handling of the Epstein\ninvestigation and the CVRA litigation. The records included, but were not limited to, boxes of\nmaterial that Villafafia updated and maintained through the course of both actions, which contained\npleadings from the Epstein investigation, the CVRA litigation, and other related cases; extensive\ncompilations of internal and external correspondence, including leters and emails; evidence such\nas telephone records, FBI reports, material received from the state investigation, and other\nconfidential investigative records; court transcripts; investigative transcripts; prosecution team\nhandwriten notes; research material; and draft and final case documents such as the NPA,\nprosecution memoranda, and federal indictments.\n\nThe USAO also provided OPR with access to filings, productions, and privileged material\nin the CVRA litigation; Outlook data collected to respond to production requests in that case; a set\nof Epstein case documents maintained by Acosta and Sloman; computer files regarding the Epstein\ncase collected by Sloman; Villafafia’s Outlook data; Acosta’s hard drive; and the permanently\nretained official U.S. Atorney records of Acosta held by the Federal Records Center.\n\n2. EOUSA Records\n\nEOUSA provided OPR with Outlook data from all five subjects and six additional\nwitnesses. This information, dating back to 2oo5, included all inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and\nsaved emails, and calendar entries that it maintained. EOUSA provided OPR with over 85o,ooo\nOutlook records in total (not including email atachments or excluding duplicate records). OPR\nidentified key time periods and fully reviewed those records. OPR applied search terms to the\nremainder of the records and reviewed any responsive documents.\n\nAfter reviewing the emails, OPR identified a data gap in Acosta’s email records: his inbox\ncontained no emails from May 26, 2oo7, through November 2, 2oo8. This gap, houever, was not\npresent with respect to Acosta’s sent email. OPR requested that EOUSA investigate. During its\ninvestigation, EOUSA discovered a data association error that incorrectly associated Acosta’s data\nwith an <span class=\"highlight\">unrelated</span> employee who had a similar name. Once the data was properly associated,\nEOUSA found and produced ll,248 Acosta emails from April 3, 2oo8, through the end of his\ntenure at the USAO. Houever, with respect to the remaining emails, EOUSA concluded that the\nemails were not transferred from the USAO when, in 2oo8 and 2oo9, Outlook data for all U.S.\n\n287\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23325"};
