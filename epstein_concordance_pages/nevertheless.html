Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l2\nIV. The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here\n\nFinally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the\nappropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and\ncertainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted\nbail, refrain from fleeing so he could atempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the Government will address the defendant’s arguments briefly in turn.\n\nA. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution\n\nAs an initial mater, as the Court itself noted at the parties’ initial appearance earlier this\nweek, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond\nthe scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New\nYork based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient\nto put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious\nchallenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and\nadditional charges brought based on New York conduct.\n\nBut more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District\nof New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA\noverwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to\nthe SDFL. The prefatory language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander\nAcosta, United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for\nthese offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final\nparagraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms\nof the agreement, “no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this\nAgreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Atorney’s Office, nor any offenses that\narose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District.”\n\nIn its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not to be construed\nas an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense” as\nto any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA,\nand additionally states that neither Epstein’s signature nor any resulting waivers or civil\nsetlements “are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver\nof any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person.” These provisions shou the parties\ncontemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not\ninitially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final\nsubstantive paragraph of the NPA states that “Epstein hereby requests that the United States\nAtorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [. . .] prosecution.”\n\nIt is well setled in the Second Circuit that “‘a plea agreement in one U.S. Atorney’s office\ndoes not, unless otherwise stated, bind another.” United States v. Prisco, 39l F. App’x 92o, 92l\n7 All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000341.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l3 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage l3\n(2d Cir. 2olo) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the\ndistrict in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates\na broader restriction.”) (citing United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o, 672 (2d Cir. l985) (per\ncuriam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the “Government” or the “United States” do not\nabrogate these principles. Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement whereby a federal\nprosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment . . . might be thought\nto bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the\nagreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement . . . . Houever, the law has evolved to the\ncontrary.”). “The mere use of the term ‘government’ in the plea agreement does not create an\naffirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular\ndistrict entering into the agreement.” United States v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l2o (2d Cir. l998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States v. Broun, No. 99-l23o,\n2oo2 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2oo2) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement,\nreiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies “even if the plea agreement purports to\nbind ‘the Government” or the “United States”) (summary order); United States v. Bruno, l59 F.\nSupp. 3d 3ll, 32l (E.D.N.Y. 2ol6) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that the\nphrase ‘United States’ shous an intent to bind all United States Atorney’s Offices. Rather, the\nplea agreement covers only Defendant’s liability in the SDFL.”). ®\nIn sum, this issue is a distraction that has litle relevance to the bail determination and does\nnothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community.\nB. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking\nNext, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal conduct” giving rise to the charges\nis his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under\nthe charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at l4, this is an issue\nfor a motion to dismiss. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the defendant’s argument is incorrect for two reasons.\nFirst, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he\nwas also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit\nadditional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states,\nincluding with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his oun eventual and frequent sexual\ngratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements\nof the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking\nenterprise, not a mere consumer.\n’ This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskou,\n688 F. Supp. 85l, 854 (E.D.N.Y. l988) (“Defendant’s argument, in effect, is that unless there is\nan explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices\nof the United States Atorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with\nthe law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrou reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement\nunless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was\ncontemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 77l F.2d at 672).\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v.

These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or combination of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community.

In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000373.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document l4 Filed o7/l5/l9 Page 8 of l8 |\n| | SORA HEARING page7\n‘oS l a He is registered in the U.S. Virgin Islands, he )\n| . | 2 has been since his release from jail.

E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 2 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

But that is not the standard.\n\nThe defense submits that when the relevant privacy interests are appropriately\nconsidered, it should not be restricted from publicly referencing individuals who have chosen to\npublicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed that the protective order\ninclude the follouing language: “Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly\nreferencing individuals who have spoken on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in\nlitigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,\nEx. A ¥ 6).\n\nIn the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen to identify themselves by\nname in numerous public fora, including: self-identifying and speaking on the record in criminal\nproceedings in the Jeffrey Epstein case and this case; as named plaintiffs in civil suits against\nMs. Maxwell and others; in on-the-record interviews with media and tabloid publications and\nnewspaper articles; publishing memoirs; appearing on air in Netflix documentaries and other\ntelevision and film productions; appearing in YouTube videos; and making, in their oun name,\nall manner of social media posts. Indeed, a Google search will reveal any number of videos and\narticles in which alleged victims not only identify themselves, but make specific allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell. As a mater of common sense, and under the law, such persons do not\nhave any privacy interest that needs to be addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.\nCorp. v. Cohn, 42o U.S. 469, 494-95 (l975) (noting, in a case where the identity of a minor rape\nvictim was disclosed in publicly filed indictments, that “the interests in privacy fade when the\ninformation involved already appears on the public record.”).\n\nYet, the government asserts that such persons <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> have “significant privacy\ninterests” (Gov’t Resp. at l), and proposes the much more limited formulation: “This Order does\nnot prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken by name\non the public record in this case” — i.e., in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A § 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical mater, the government’s proposed\nlanguage would permit the defense to publicly reference a total of one person — the individual\nwho spoke under her oun name at Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 4o). It would not\ninclude the ll alleged victims who spoke or submited leters under their oun names at the\nAugust 27, 2ol9 hearing in United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-RMB, even though\nfive of those individuals made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See Dkt. 53 at 43-44, 55, 56,\n57, 58). It would not include the four individuals who have civilly sued Ms. Maxwell under their\noun names alleging conduct similar to that alleged in the indictment. Nor would it include\nnumerous other individuals, described above, who have spoken out publicly to the press or on\nsocial media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. Indeed, the government’s proposed\nlanguage is even more restrictive than what they previously agreed to in the Epstein case, which\nalloued Epstein’s counsel to publicly reference individuals who had identified themselves in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool686\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic disclosure. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v.

The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that disclosure was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking disclosure of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the disclosure. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required disclosure\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\n\nlil. The Government’s Plan to Review Certain Files from the Florida Investigation\nA. Relevant Background Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> prepared to go significantly above and beyond its disclosure obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\ndisclosure obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span>\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\nits outside vendor to image, stamp, and dounload that electronic discovery, which the Government\nfinished preparing for production last week, from an electronic database. The volume of that\nproduction is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that\nthe vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the\nGovernment has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2o2o deadline, and the vendor\nis making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next\nweek and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional\ntime beyond November 9 to finalize this production. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the\nGovernment has made numerous productions consistent with the discovery schedule in this case\nand is working diligently to continue to meet the discovery deadlines in this case.\n\nWith respect to the defense’s other claims and accusations, the Government is prepared to\nrespond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s accusations about\nthe Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally incorrect, but\nalso include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to\nreach agreement with the Government “[f]ollouing the close of discovery,” which has not yet\noccurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2o2o, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless\natempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule l6 discovery, or on a faulty\ndefinition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. l3, 2o2o,\nDtk. No. 4l, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of production of witness list until shortly before\ntrial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule l6 does not require\nproduction of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65, at l-2\n(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a\ndefendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the\nGovernment)).”\n\nWith respect to the Government’s October 7 leter regarding other agency files, the\ndefense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who\nit believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the\nGovernment has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more\nGovernment may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,\nthe Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.\n\n? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense nou contends that evidence\nabout the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Atorney’s Office\nfor the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense\nmakes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that\nagreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged\nin this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those\narguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.\n\n> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding\nany concerns about the Government’s October 7 leter or the Government’s planned productions\nprior to filing the Defense Leter with the Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nthat the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts\nare already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.\n\nSecond, the Defense Leter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the\nGovernment’s control, but that the Government has <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> spent significant time addressing\nat the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that\nMDC staff has been instructed to allou defense counsel to pass papers to their client for her to\nreview during visits. Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal\ncounsel also noted that the table in the atorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier\ndoun the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-l9. Atorneys and clients are required to sit on\nopposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may\nbe reviewing in such a way that both the client and atorneys can view it while remaining on\nopposite sides of the table. Finally, the Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the\ndefendant has access to her discovery for approximately l3 hours per day and therefore receives\nmore time to review her discovery than any other inmate in the MDC.\n\nXK XK XK\n\nThe Government is working expeditiously to meet its obligations and discovery deadlines,\nwhich it takes very seriously. The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the\nproduction of discovery as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that its productions are\ncomplete. At any point, should the defense have questions or concerns about the discovery, the\nGovernment has been and remains available to discuss any such issues directly with counsel.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nAUDREY STRAUSS\n\nActing United States Atorney\n\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\n\nAssistant United States Atorneys\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\n> It is not clear to the Government what documents the defendant is unable to view at this point,\nbut to be clear, the technical issues have, at their worst, impacted the defendant’s ability to view\nonly a subset of the hundreds of thousands of pages produced to her. The defense has previously\nprovided the Government with lists of documents that the defendant could not open. In response,\nthe Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformated versions of each\nidentified document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on\nthe MDC computer system. Yesterday, defense counsel informed the Government that the\ndefendant still cannot view certain files, but the defense has not identified all of the specific\nunreviewable documents. In any event, the Government will continue to work with the defense\nand the MDC to ensure that the defendant can review all discovery.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/o8/2o Page 2 of 3\nPage 2\n\n§ 37l.

THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2539\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l2 of l4\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l4o Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of 22\nSee Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\nexpansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v.

Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6).

Maxwell cites no precedent for the proposition that,\nin the criminal context, much less in the context of criminal statutes of limitations, Landgraf\nforecloses prosecutions permited by the Constitution.

That footnote is\ntoo slender a reed to support Maxwell’s entire motion to dismiss the Indictment as untimely.\nMoreover, Maxwell has identified no case in the intervening seventeen years in which the Supreme\nCourt has embraced Judge Calabresi’s view. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 63l (finding arguments\nrelating to Judge Calabresi’s footnote unpersuasive, and concluding that Section 3283 applies\nretroactively under Landgraf). As Weingarten recognized, any court to hold that “retroactively\nextending a filing period for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under\nLandgraf’ will be the first to do so. 865 F.3d at 58.\n\nThe defendant also argues that “criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted\nin favor of repose,” relying on the Supreme Court’s decision in Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S.\nll2, ll5 (l97o). Toussie considered whether a person’s failure to register for the draft was a\ncontinuing offense subjecting him to prosecution eight years later, notwithstanding the five-year\nlimitations period in Section 3282. /d. at ll4. In that context, the Court invoked a presumption\nin favor of repose when determining whether the underlying conduct was time-barred. But that\npresumption says nothing about whether Congress intended an extension of a statute of limitations\nto apply purely prospectively, a question governed by Landgraf.

Prejudice in this context\nrefers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 6o2\nF.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).

Moreover, in both\nthe Indictment and in this memorandum, the Government has provided extensive detail regarding\nMinor Victim-3’s anticipated testimony, which avoids any concern that the defendant will be\nsurprised at trial, which was the animating concern in Hsia.

On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.* The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached.

You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3364\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.?”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3396\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003400.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which involve this matier, please contact the offics listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*”4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also recetved a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*44 The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc.

The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties.

The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX.

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”**! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.**’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”>°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003443.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”?”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”°°° <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf.

I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**’ The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°* The government conceded, houever, that with regard to\nthe New York prosecution in which Epstein had been indicted, “[p]etitioner and other Epstein\n387 Doe, Jane Doe l and Jane Doe 2’s Submission on Proposed Remedies (May 23, 2ol9).\n\n388 Doe, Opinion and Order (Sept. l6, 2ol9).

The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*”°\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . . . devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

All proposed\nopinion testimony must be \"relevant to the task at hand.” Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, 5o9 U.S. 579, 597 (l993).

Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (emphasis supplied, citations omited). Any\ndefense expert that relates to the testimony of the accusers or 4o4(b) witnesses cannot possibly\nbe disclosed before Ms. Maxwell has even been provided access to that testimony.\n\nTo illustrate the point, one need look only at the government's expert disclosure. The\nproposed testimony for the government's expert, although purportedly not based on a review\nof the facts of this case, <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> appears to have been crafted by the government with full\nknouledge of the accusers’ specific allegations. For example, the government proffers that\ntheir expert will testify that \"minor victims ... may not identify themselves as victims of abuse\nwhile it is ongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood.\"\nClearly, the accusers must have represented facts to support these contentions or else there\nwould be no grounds to admit this \"blind\" expert opinion testimony. Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nexpected to hire experts and divine what would be relevant to this case before she is provided\nthe statements by these accusers, whose credibility will be the central question for the jury in\nthis case.\n\nThe Court originally ordered the defense expert disclosures four weeks before trial and\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293 Filed o5/25/2l Pagel7 of 32\nSouthern District of New York indictment because they arose out of “the same conspiratorial\nagreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the Eastern District.” Jd. at 672.\n\nThe Second Circuit rejected this argument finding that, as a general rule, a plea\nagreement only binds the prosecutor’s office that entered into the agreement, unless it\n“affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. Houever, the\nCourt highlighted the apparent anomaly of this rule, noting that an agreement with “the\nGovernment” to dismiss counts of an indictment “might be thought to bar the United States from\nreprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the agreement expressly limits\nthe scope of the agreement to the district in which the dismissed charges are initially brought.”\nId. The Court further explained that application of the “affirmative appearance” rule was\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> appropriate because it had not been presented with a situation where the counts in\nthe second prosecution were identical to the dismissed counts. /d. Although the defendants had\nargued that the charges in Counts One and Three of the SDNY indictment “result[ed] from the\nsame conspiratorial agreement” as the dismissed counts in the EDNY indictment, the Court\nfound that the SDNY charges covered conduct “extending more than two years beyond the date\nof the period covered by the dismissed charges,” are were therefore “not the same as the charges\nthat were dismissed.” /d. As a result, the Court found that the default rule could be applied in\nthat case. /d. (“[T]he new charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant application of the\n... rule concerning construction of plea agreements.”).\n\nAnnabi, therefore, did not hold that the “affirmative appearance” rule of construction\napplies in cases, like this one, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will\nabandon certain offenses as part of a negotiated agreement, and then a second federal district\nlater seeks to charge those very same offenses based on the exact same conduct.

Ms. Maxwell <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> preserves her argument and reasserts\nit with respect to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAs it existed in 2oo4, the federal sex trafficking statute, l8 U.S.C. § l59l, charged in\nCounts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment provided that “[w]hoever knouingly ... recruits,\nentices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person ... knouing that ... the\nperson has not atained the age of l8 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act”\nis guilty of acrime.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(a) (2oo4). Because the statute uses the phrase “will be\ncaused” before the phrase “to engage in a commercial sex act,” it is not necessary for the\ncommercial sex act to take place for the crime to be complete. See United States v. Garcia-\nGonzalez, 7l4 F.3d 3o6, 3l2 (5\" Cir. 2ol3) (“The future verb tense of the phrase ‘will be\ncaused’—which precedes ‘to engage in a commercial sex act’”—indicates that a sex act does not\nhave to occur to satisfy the elements of the child-sex-trafficking offense.”). For the reasons\nalready set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous motion, the statute of limitations in l8 U.S.C. §\n3283 does not govern l8 U.S.C. § l59l because the offense does not “necessarily entail” the\nsexual abuse of a minor and therefore is not an “offense involving” such conduct. Counts Five\nand Six must therefore be dismissed.\n\nIV. The Court Should Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as\n\nMultiplicitous.\n\nCount Five must also be dismissed along with either Count One or Count Three as\nmultiplicitous. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss\neither Count One or Count Three of the $l Indictment as multiplicitous because they charged the\nsame conspiracy under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. (Dkt. l22, 2lo). Count Five of the S2 Indictment\ncharges Ms. Maxwell with yet another § 37l conspiracy from 2ool-2oo4 based on the\nallegations of Accuser-4. (S2 Indictment 9 22-25).

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims.

Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—aincluding victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “‘as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had ‘“‘made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nIl.

Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-oooo43lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 68 of 349\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate\nthe Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Atorney[s’] Manual, and all of the\nvarious iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,\nyou have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position\nof weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the\ndefense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the\nmeeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,\nand your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes\naway that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points\nraised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength\nof the case.\n\nIn the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s\ncounsel to me.\n\nMenchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.\nVillafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not\nunsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4365\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 74 of 349\nequipment.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer equipment to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l29 of 349\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. !*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims. She did not regard\nl6l Villafafia added, “We have four more girls coming in tomorrou.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.'*! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that .. . l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nl7? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\nl8D In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\nl8l During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\nll4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4438\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004486.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l89 of 349\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of l8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\nrecipient “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t . . . have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\nat OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004524.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 227 of 349\n\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-\nwitness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that\nappropriate victim notifications occurred in every mater\ninvestigated or brought by the Office.\n\nC. USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 — SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at . . . the\nconclusion, or. . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4524\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 247 of 349\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\nmaking.*7*\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 249 of 349\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, ““The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open . . . it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n329 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 256 of 349\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.*4+ The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*4° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”*“° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”*4” Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\naH In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (5th Cir. 2oo8).

JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”*>! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?>?\n\n3ol Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n352 Sloman replied, “Good.”\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004557.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 26o of 349\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.*°”\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the restitution mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victms who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 268 of 349\nF. 2olo - 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”? The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*8° <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”°*! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, § G.2, available at htps://(www_justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\n58 See 2oll Guidelines, Art.

See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.

Accordingly, the petitioners requested multiple specific remedies, including rescission\nof the NPA; a writen apology to all victims from the government; a meeting with Acosta,\nVillafafia, and her supervisors; access to government records, including grand jury materials;\ntraining for USAO employees; and monetary sanctions and atorneys’ fees.*°”\n\nFollouing Epstein’s indictment on federal charges in New York and subsequent death\nwhile in custody, on September l6, 2ol9, the district judge presiding over the CVRA case denied\nthe petitioners’ motion for remedies and closed the case, stating that Epstein’s death “rendered the\nmost significant issue that was pending before the Court, namely, whether the Government’s\nviolation of Petitioners’ rights under the CVRA invalidated the NPA, moot.”**8 The court did not\norder the government to take corrective measures, but stated that it “fully expects the Government\nwill honor its representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the\nproper treatment of crime victims.”**? The court also denied the petitioners’ request for atorneys’\nfees, finding that the government did not act in bad faith, because, “[a]lthough unsuccessful on the\nmerits of the issue of whether there was a violation of the CVRA, the Government asserted\nlegitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation.”\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, Wild appealed the district court’s rejection of the requested\nremedies, through a Petition for a Writ of Mandamus filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit.*”° In its responsive brief, the government expressed sympathy for Wild and\n“regret[] [for] the manner in which it communicated with her in the past.”*?! <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the\ngovernment argued that, “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in SDFL because\nno criminal charges were brought.”*°?

The government\nshould have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way\nwith Ms. Wild, and for that, we are genuinely sorry.*??\n\nOn April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied\nWild’s petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that “the CVRA does not apply before the\ncommencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, on the facts of this case, does not provide the\npetitioner here with any judicially enforceable rights.”°\"* The court conducted a thorough analysis\nof the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The court\ndistinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a “three-sentence discussion . .. devoid of any\nanalysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court noted that its\ninterpretation of the CVRA was consistent with the Department’s 2olo OLC opinion concerning\nvictim standing under the CVRA and the Department’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”\nFinally, the court raised separation of pouers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)\ninterpretation of victim standing under the CVRA, noting that such an interpretation would\ninterfere with prosecutorial discretion.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the court was highly critical of the government’s conduct in the underlying\ncase, stating that the government “[s]eemingly . . . defer[red] to Epstein’s lawyers” regarding\ninformation it provided victims about the NPA and that its “efforts seem to have graduated from\npassive nondisclosure to (or at least close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that\nalthough it “seems obvious” that the government “should have consulted with petitioner (and other\nvictims) before negotiating and executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court could not conclude that the\ngovernment was obligated to do so. In addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly\nworded opinion asserting that the majority’s statutory interpretation was “contorted” because the\n“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not include [a] post-indictment temporal\nrestriction.”\n\nOn May 5, 2o2o, Wild filed a petition for rehearing en banc.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 29l of 349\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open . . . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*'* <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o5 of 349\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44!\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\ni In Florida Bar v. Joy, the court affirmed a referee’s conclusion that Joy violated FRPCs 4-4.l(a) and 4-8.4(c)\n“for making false statements by omission of material facts in his representations [to counsel].” Florida Bar v. Joy,\n679 So. 2d ll65, ll66-68 (Fla. l996). See also Florida Bar re Webster, 647 So. 2d 8l6 (Fla. l994) (petition for\nremstatement denied due to “misrepresentation by omission’).\n\n2 In Feinberg, 76o So. 2d at 938, the court found that an Assistant State Atorney lacked candor and violated\nethics rules when, after meeting with a defendant outside his atorney’s presence, the prosecutor falsely stated to the\ndefense atorney that he (the prosecutor) had not met with the defendant.\n278\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3ll of 349\n\nOPR evaluated the conduct of each subject based on his or her individual role in various\ndecisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances.

In Commonwealth v. Zuber, 353 A.2d 44l (Pa. l976),\nduring plea negotiations in a murder case, the prosecutor agreed to recommend to the\nsentencing court that Rickey Zuber receive a sentence of seven to fourteen years in\nprison if he pleaded guilty. /d. at 442-43.

This was not only misleading,\nit was also an end-run around Rule 4o4(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in\nthe indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies.

The\ngovernment also represented for the first time that Accuser-3 is expected to testify that\nId. Accordingly, Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was a minor when she traveled or when she\nallegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the United States.\n\nDespite having been alerted to the problems with Accuser-3’s evidence, the government\nrepeated the same allegations related to Accuser-3 in the second superseding indictment filed\nafter the pretrial motions were fully briefed. See S2 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. l87) (“S2\nIndictment”) §f[ 9(c), l3(d), l9(d).

The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

In that circumstance, any question as to the reliability of the witness’s\nidentifications goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.” Jd.\n\nSecond, an unduly suggestive identification procedure does not alone require suppression\nof the identification evidence.

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005903.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l3 of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThese ll pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-\ntional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes\nand functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and\ninformation processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder\nand McNeil (2oo7) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool\nin the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the\nimportance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence\nof corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-\nuators must acknouledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are\ninherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found\nin its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>,\npsychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological\nprocesses by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file\na false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation\nare not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may\nalso help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be\nrelevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.\n\nIn proposing these pathways, it is important to acknouledge that psy-\nchological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and\nshould not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine\ntruth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a\nclaim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-\nders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and\nabuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled\nand other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk\nof sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately\nin conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may\nhave difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.\n\nThe legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced\nby victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-\nways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help\nelucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in\na sexual assault case.\n\nREFERENCES\nAhlgrim-Delzell, L., & Dudley, J.R.

The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006828.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 43\n292 — S. Craven et al.\nis crucial in order to prevent child sexual abuse. Houever, retrospective identification of\nsexual grooming, i.e. after a sexual offence has been commited, is much easier than\nprospective identification, i.e. before a sexual offence. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the later is necessary in\norder to prevent the sexual abuse from taking place. The reason for this is because the\nbehaviours used to groom a child for sexual abuse are not dissimilar to innocent behaviour\nintended to broaden a young person’s experiences. The only difference may be the motivation\nunderlying the behaviour.\nSelf-grooming\nvan Dam (2ool) reports that during treatment, offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves’.\nThey were referring to the justification or denial of their offending behaviour. It therefore\nseems important to consider this as part of the grooming process. Houever, it may be more\nagreeable to refer to this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of the term\n“grooming”. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, self-grooming is likely to play a part in the move from being\nmotivated to sexually abuse a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the\njustification or denial of the steps child sexual offenders take touards abusing a child.\nFurthermore, self-grooming is likely to be affected by the response from the community and\nthe child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely to\nresult in further justification or denial of their actions and more entrenched sexual interest in\nchildren and motivation to offend. “Failure”, on the other hand, is likely to result in the\ndesistence of offending or the offender developing/enahancing his skills/strategies to ensure\nsuccess.\n\nJustification and denial of offenders’ behaviour manifests in cognitive distortions. Ward\nand Keenan (l999) propose that child sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of\nimplicit theories, which relate to themselves, the victim and the world. Implicit theories help\nindividuals to understand the world around them. Problems arise because offenders’ implicit\ntheories are maladaptive and supportive of sex with children. These implicit theories\nsubsequently affect encoding and interpretation of future behaviours and events. Ward and\nKeenan have identified five implicit theories that account for most of the cognitive distortions\nheld by child sex offenders: children as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous world;\nuncontrollability; and nature of harm.\n\nOf course, it is not only offenders who have maladaptive implicit theories. For example,\nmany people have an implicit theory that children are at most risk from strangers, which is not\nconsistent with research findings. Houever, it is easier to believe that strangers sexually abuse\nchildren than accept that friends and family do; hence, this implicit theory helps to shelter\npeople from the harsh nature of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a similar way,\nbecause it is easier for offenders to believe that the child seduced them than to accept that they\nsexually abused a child.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others\n\nGrooming the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 2ool). Child sex\noffenders seem to have a special ability in recognizing vulnerable children (Conte et al., l989).\nThese vulnerabilities may be that the children have a poor relationship with their parents, do\nnot have many friends (Berliner & Conte, l99o), or have already been victimized (Leberg,\nl997). Alternatively, offenders may target women who were sexually abused as children,\nbecause the offender considers them easier to re-victimize.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007435.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\nharmed by conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy—and she was—then she is a “victim” under\nthe relevant statutes.\n\nFinally, Minor Victim-3 is also a “victim” for purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2,\nbecause she is clearly someone who “can reasonably be characterized as a ‘victim of alleged sexual\nmisconduct.’” Fed. R. Evid. 4l2, Advisory Commitee Notes (l994). Given Rule 4l2’s broad\napplication in not just criminal cases but also civil cases such as claims of sexual harassment, see\nWolak v. Spucci, 2l7 F.3d l57, l6o (2d Cir. 2ooo), it cannot be read to define victims as only those\nindividuals whose victimization would alone satisfy all of the elements of a charged crime. As set\nforth above, Epstein’s conduct with respect to Minor Victim-3 is plainly “alleged sexual\nmisconduct,” and therefore she is a victim as defined in Rule 4l2.\n\nFor these reasons, Minor Victim-3 is a “victim” under the provisions of federal law\ndiscussed above. Moreover, the Government respectfully submits that even if its reading of these\nprovisions is incorrect, that does not affect the admissibility of Minor Victim-3’s testimony as\ndirect evidence: evidence that does not itself establish every element of the charged crime may\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> be admissible as direct evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, llo F.3d 94l,\n942 (2d Cir. l997); United States v. Carboni, 2o4 F.3d 39, 44 (2d Cir. 2ooo). And Minor Victim-\n3’s status as a “victim” under the foregoing provisions of law certainly does not affect the\nadmissibility of her testimony under Rule 4o4(b), which permits the admission of other act\ntestimony that almost by definition does not satisfy the elements of the charged crime.

The Court Must Vacate Ms. Maxwell’s Convictions on the Mann Act Counts Due to\n\na Constructive Amendment/Variance from the Crimes Charged in the Indictment.\n\nThroughout this case, the government has consistently maintained that to convict Ms.\nMaxwell on the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that Ms.\nMaxwell enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same,\nwith the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York law. The\ngovernment further acknouledged that evidence of sexual activity that occurred in locations\noutside of New York, like Epstein’s residences in New Mexico and Florida, was not, by itself,\nsufficient to convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act charges.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the government repeatedly resisted numerous efforts by the defense to\nclarify these points for the jury, both in limiting instructions or in the jury charge itself. The\ngovernment stressed over and over that the jury could not possibly be confused that the Mann\nAct counts had to involve a violation of New York law because the jury instructions charged\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo893o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 66\n2.

The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009158.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 37of5l\nwitness and missing documents insufficient prejudice); United States v.

Moreover, even when a claim of prejudice\nis based upon the complete loss of a witness’s testimony or other evidence, a defendant\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> must shou hou that testimony or evidence would have affected the outcome or\notherwise have assisted the case. See United States v. Gilbert, 266 F.3d ll8o, ll87 (9th Cir. 2ool)\n(defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim rejected due to failure to shou “hou the testimony from\n[three absent] witnesses would have benefited his case”); United States v. Spears, l59 F.3d lo8l,\nlo85 (7th Cir. l998) (“[A] defendant must do more than shou that a particular witness is\nunavailable and that the witness’ testimony would have helped the defense. He must also shou\nthat the witness would have testified, withstood cross-examination, and that the jury would have\nfound the witness credible.”’). “Courts have held that ‘the defendant also has the burden of shouing\nthat the lost testimony or information was not available through other means.’” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8\nWL 4o43l4o, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d lo37, lo4l (8th Cir. 2oo2)).\n\nThe vast majority of pre-indictment delay cases fail on the first prong. See, e.g., Marion,\n4o4 U.S. at 324-26 (fading witness memories insufficient; “no one suggests that every delay-\ncaused detriment to a defendant’s case should abort a criminal prosecution’); Snyder, 668 F.2d at\n689 (death of a defense witness three years before indictment insufficient prejudice); King, 56o\nF.2d at l3o-3l (death of witness and missing documents insufficient prejudice); United States v.\nTannelli, 46l F.2d 483, 485 (2d Cir. l972) (unavailability of witnesses insufficient prejudice);\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 45of5l\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish that the Government Delayed the Indictment\nfor an Improper Purpose\n3. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong[.]”’). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\n\nThe Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment\nfiled within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,\ndeliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical\nadvantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (delay must be an “intentional\ndevice to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused” (quoting Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324)); see\nalso United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (“To shou unjustifiable conduct,\na defendant must demonstrate that the government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair\ntactical advantage.”); United States v. Delacruz, 97o F.

Do you agree with the follouing statement: “Based on my oun experience and without\nknouing the particular facts of any case, if someone claims that they were abused, it is\nmore likely that I will believe they are telling the truth”?\n\n9. Do you believe that people who make allegations of being sexually abused as a child\n\nare usually telling the truth?\n\nlo. Do you believe that victims would not go through the stress of testifying at trial about\n\nthe sexual abuse they suffered as a child unless they were telling the truth?\nD. Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\nQuestionnaire Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the prospective\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury questionnaire or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is sufficient as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, because this issue has not been\nresolved, the Court should ask additional questions to elicit whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were deliberately false. That includes questions to establish when he first\nspoke to the press, whether he contacted the press himself, whether he got paid for his interviews,\nand what his intentions were about serving on the Maxwell jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell submits that whether Juror 5o received payment for interviews after the trial\nis probative of his intention to not disclose information during voir dire that would have called\ninto question his ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror. As discussed in the Amicus Brief,\nfame, prestige, and profit are pouerful motivators; and the lure has given rise to the so-called\n2loo689.3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 44 of 66\n2.

What these\ntwo jurors disclosed to the (presumably) ten jurors who responded to the questionnaire\ntruthfully will be relevant to determine the identity of the second juror and what Juror No.\n5o said to the other jurors.\n49\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9748\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009821.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 23 of 49\nwould have truthfully affirmed that he could be fair and impartial, then the record is clear that the\nCourt would not have struck him for cause, and the defendant’s motion should be denied.\n\nb. The Defendant’s Arguments Regarding Bias Are Unpersuasive\n\nA party may challenge a juror for cause based only on “narrouly specified, provable and\nlegally cognizable bases.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997) (quotation and\ncitation omited). In the context of voir dire, challenges for cause generally fall into one of three\n“limited” categories: actual bias, implied bias, or inferable bias. Jd. Houever, in the different\ncontext presented here—a post-trial allegation of juror bias, in a retrospective determination of a\nhypothetical challenge for cause—the Second Circuit has stated that it is an open question whether\nthe second and third of these categories are applicable. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. That is, “the\nremedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity\nto prove actual bias,” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5 (l982) (emphasis added), and, as such,\nit is unclear that bias may be implied or inferred, see Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. The Government\nsubmits that actual bias is the only relevant inquiry in this context, see Smith, 455 U.S. at 2l5, but\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> addresses each category in turn.\n\ni. Actual Bias\n\n“Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’—the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference\nthat the person will not act with entire impartiality.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (quoting United States\nv. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)). “[A] finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of\ndemeanor and credibility that are peculiarly within a trial judge’s province.” Jd. at 44 (quotation\nand citation omited). Actual bias “cannot be found unless a prospective juror is adequately\nquestioned on voir dire with respect to his or her ability to apply the law impartially.” Jd. at 44.\nThe district court has “broad discretion” in such questioning and “[t]here is no particular script\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo982l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. As a threshold mater, the Court should inquire\nwhether Juror 5o’s public statements are true—i.e., whether he was in fact a victim of sexual\nabuse.'® If the answer is yes, then the Court should determine why Juror 5o <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> answered\n“no” to Question 48. Finally, the Court should ask such questions as to permit it to make the\nhypothetical determination posed by McDonough’s second prong: If Juror 5o had accurately\nanswered Question 48, would the Court have struck him for cause?\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror questionnaire that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009837.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 39 of 49\nMem. at 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 5o should be limited to only what is strictly\nnecessary to determine the relevant issues.\n\n3. There Is No Basis to Call Any Other Juror as a Witness\n\nThere is no basis to call any other witness at a hearing aside from Juror 5o. The questioning\nof Juror 5o is sufficient to address the only questions as to which the rigorous standard for an\nevidentiary hearing has been met.\n\nThe defendant <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> proposes calling each of the twelve jurors for testimony about\nwhether they have experienced sexual abuse. (Def. Mem. at 5o, 57). It would be difficult to\nimagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring each of the jurors to return\nto court weeks or months after their service was complete to testify about such a deeply personal\nand sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is exactly the sort of “fishing expedition” that\npresents the “evil consequences” of which the Second Circuit has repeatedly warned. See\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 543; Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe defendant’s request for such an inquisition is based on a single sentence in a newspaper\narticle, which reports that an anonymous “second juror described in an interview with The New\nYork Times having been sexually abused as a child.” See\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2o22/ol/o5/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.'7 It is\nquestionable that this report itself may be considered under Rule 6o6(b), insofar as the next\nsentence refers to the juror’s experience in the context of jury deliberations, so it is not clear from\nthe article whether the anonymous juror made any statements to the reporter that were separate\nThe defendant’s motion also states that Juror 5o has made public statements about another juror\nwho discussed experiences with sexual abuse in the context of deliberations. Rule 6o6(b)\nprecludes the Court from considering this. See Warger, 574 U.S. at 43 (affirming denial of motion\nfor a new trial under McDonough, where the only evidence of juror dishonesty was an affidavit\nfrom another juror regarding statements a juror had made during deliberations).\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 4o of 49\n\nfrom his or her discussion of deliberations. But even if it were properly considered, this one-\nsentence, hearsay report of an anonymous speaker is not a sufficient basis for dragging the entire\njury in for questioning at a hearing in an effort to root out the identity of this particular juror. As\nnoted, a hearing is warranted only where there is “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.” Stewart, 59o F.3d at l33-34\n(quotation omited). “Gossip and anonymous tips do not satisfy this standard.” United States v.\nStewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6). The\nSecond Circuit and courts in this district have thus repeatedly found that a hearing is not necessary\non similar facts.\n\nFor example, in United States v. Guzman Loera, a magazine article published shortly after\nthe verdict stated that an unnamed juror alleged that jurors folloued media coverage of the trial in\nviolation of the court’s instructions, and that they heard prejudicial information not admited\nduring the trial, including that the defendant had drugged and raped underaged girls. No. l9-2239,\n2o22 WL 2ll99, at *l2 (2d Cir. Jan. 25, 2o22). During trial, the district court had repeatedly\ninstructed the jury to avoid media coverage and on two occasions had canvassed the jury and spoke\nwith jurors individually about particular articles. /d. One juror acknouledged seeing the relevant\nheadline before turning away and another acknouledged seeing part of a headline before closing\nthe application. /d. & n.l5. The anonymous juror’s statements in the magazine article, houever,\nsuggested that the extent of juror exposure to this prejudicial media information was far more\nextensive, and that some jurors had discussed lying to the judge when he inquired about their\nexposure to that coverage. See Brief for Appellant, 2o2o WL 575793o, at *l57-*6l (2d Cir. Sept.\n4, 2o2o) (quoting article). <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the district court concluded that the defendant had failed\nto meet his burden to establish that an evidentiary hearing was warranted, and the Second Circuit\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 24\nrepeatedly, and the Court agreed, that evidence of travel to locations other than New York, and\nsexual abuse that occurred in those locations, was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies. As a\nresult, the jury heard a great deal of testimony from Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer, as well as\nother evidence, about conduct that took place in Epstein’s residences in New Mexico, London,\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and, of course, Florida. Indeed, a large portion of Jane’s testimony,\nwhich was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies, described incidents of sexual abuse in\nEpstein’s residence in Palm Beach that involved no interstate travel. (Tr. 298-3l5).\nAccordingly, the geographic scope of Count Five (Florida) was included within the geographic\nscope of Count Three.\n\nCount Five did not describe a separate, independent conspiracy. Rather, it was a smaller\nsubset of the broader overarching conspiracy charged in Count Three. Counts Three and Five\nare therefore multiplicitous. See United States v. Calderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. l992)\n(finding two conspiracies were multiplicitous where, among other things, the time frame and\ngeographic scope of one conspiracy was entirely contained within the other conspiracy and the\ncore participants were the same); see also id. at 48 (“The Government cannot be permited to\nretry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies, wholly contained within the scope of a\nlarge conspiracy, until it finds one small enough to be proved to the satisfaction of a jury.’’).\n\nC. Common Overt Acts\n\nThe government argues that the lack of common overt acts between Count Three and\nCount Five indicates that they were different conspiracies. (Opp. at 3o). As we explained in our\ninitial Motion, because Count Five was based on Carolyn’s allegations and did not involve Jane,\nKate, or Annie Farmer, that count alleged overt acts specific to Carolyn that were not alleged in\nCount Three. (Mot. at 24; Ind. 9] 25a-d, l9a-e). <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, because the conspiracy charged\nin Count Five was a subset of the conspiracy charged in Count Three, as discussed above, the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel3 of 4o\n\nThe parties dispute whether the first prong of McDonough requires “deliberate juror\nmisconduct”—that is, whether the juror must have deliberately provided a false answer in voir\ndire. The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.7 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough. See Dkt. No. 6l4.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010368.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page2 of 45\nThree, and Five) because they are “multiplicitous”—meaning that they all charge the same\noffense—and therefore entry of judgment on all three counts would violate the Fifth\nAmendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span>\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo368\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“Ta|lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free .... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.’’).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admited such testimony concerning\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 36 of 45\nIndictment. The Defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”).

The S2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had\nlocated and interviewed Carolyn, charged offense conduct that lasted “up to and including in or\nabout 2oo4.” (S2 Ind. 9§ ll, l7, 23, 27). The expanded end date of the S2 Indictment was based\nsolely on Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and corroborating evidence. Yet the government\nalleged that the offense conduct ended in 2oo4, even though the government knew Carolyn’s\nrecollection of when she last visited Epstein and was aware of the two message slips when it\nfiled the S2 Indictment. The Court should hold the government to its allegations and not allou it\nto expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.\nBennet, 37 F.3d 687, 7oo (l* Cir. l994) (“In determining ‘the last date of the offense of\nconviction’ for ex post facto purposes and ... Application Note [2 of § lBl.ll], it is only\nreasonable to hold the Government to its oun alleged dates.”).\n\nFor these reasons, the record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct\ncontinued past November l, 2oo4, the effective date of the 2oo4 Guidelines. The Court must\ntherefore apply the 2oo3 Guidelines to avoid an ex post facto violation.\n\nC. The Goals of Sentencing Are Not Served by Applying the More Onerous\n\n2oo4 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.\n\nIf the Court finds that the offense conduct continued past November l, 2oo4, it should\n<span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> vary dounwardly and sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2oo3 Guidelines apply. The\nvariance would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in the\noffense conduct by 2oo3 at the latest, when the earlier Guidelines were in effect.

The aggravating role enhancement therefore does not apply to any of the three offense\ngroups.\n\nB. The Criminal Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”\n\nEven if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell supervised another “participant,” the record\ndoes not support a finding that the criminal activity related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or Carolyn\nwas “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.’ Under the Guidelines, the Court must\ntreat each minor victim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies based solely on\nthe criminal activity related to that minor victim. See USSG § 2Gl.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection\n(d)(l) directs that if the relevant conduct of an offense of conviction includes travel or\ntransportation to engage in a commercial sex act or prohibited sexual conduct in respect to more\nthan one minor ... each such minor shall be treated as if contained in a separate count of\nconviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct from the 2ool-2oo4 time period\nrelated to Carolyn to justify applying the aggravating role enhancement to the criminal activity in\nl994-l997 related to “Jane” or in l996 related to Annie Farmer.\n\nThe government <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> atempts to justify the enhancement as to each of the three\nminor victims by making a broad assertion about the nature and scope of the conspiracy as a\nwhole, rather than making an individualized determination that the criminal activity was\n“otherwise extensive” as to each. (See PSR at 59). Because that is insufficient to establish that\nthe criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at most, be subject to a\ntwo-point enhancement under USSG § 3Bl.l(c).\n\n° The government does not argue that the aggravating role enhancement applies because the criminal activity\ninvolved “five or more participants,” conceding that the trial record does not support the conclusion that five or\nmore people criminally participated in the offense conduct.\nIo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo44o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010451.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page5of77\nconspirators or accomplices of Epstein in connection with his controversial Florida plea deal, and\nalthough three of those same women were anonymously referenced in the 2ol9 SDNY indictment\ncharging Epstein, the government chose not to prosecute any of them. Instead, the spotlight turned\nto Ghislaine Maxwell, with whom Epstein had had a relationship that was long since over and who\nwas not named in the Florida “sweetheart” deal.\n\nMs. Maxwell did not appear in the 2ol9 SDNY indictment against Epstein, nor was she\nthe subject of the 2oo7 SDFL grand jury presentation. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the government pivoted to\nMs. Maxwell, who up to that point had never been the focus of any criminal prosecution for these\nevents, and spent the next year investigating her. In doing so, SDNY had to reach back to events\nthat were over 2o years old, a decade before the conduct that was the subject of the SDFL\nprosecution and the 2ol9 Epstein indictment. Almost a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest,\nSDNY’s Acting U.S. Atorney put the timing of Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution and the extreme age\nof the charges against her in context:\n\nWe were working hard on this investigation this past year. It’s not easy to put\ntogether a case that goes back that far, but it was nothing other than we did the\ninvestigation and we were ready at this time to proceed.?\n\nThe entire focus of the accusations initially aimed at Epstein were nou centered on one\ndefendant alone — Ghislaine Maxwell — at a time when she was already being vilified in the press\nand the public domain. The media coverage was relentless and voluminous: dozens of broadcast\ndocumentaries, tens of streamed videos and podcasts, and publication of some 5o books and\nthousands of superficially writen articles. The tsunami of one-sided, overwhelmingly negative\ncoverage about Ms. Maxwell that folloued the arrest and death of Epstein presented Ms. Maxwell\nas a caricature of evil, a depiction that has inevitably shaped the public’s opinion of her.

Accordingly, there is ample basis in the record to impose this enhancement.\n\nThe text of U.S.S.G. 3Bl.l(a) calls for the application of its enhancement if “the defendant\nwas an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that” either “involved five or more participants,”\nor “was otherwise extensive.” The defense correctly points out that Application Note 2 to this\nGuidelines provides, “To qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have\nbeen the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants. An upward\ndeparture may be warranted, houever, in the case of a defendant who did not organize, lead,\nmanage, or supervise another participant, but who <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> exercised management\nresponsibility over the property, assets, or activities of a criminal organization.” Application Note\nl defines a “participant” as “a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the\noffense, but need not have been convicted.” Despite those Application Notes, houever, the\nGovernment is not aware of any Second Circuit case requiring that, where the enhancement turns\non the “otherwise extensive” prong, rather than the “five or more participants” prong, the defendant\nmust supervise a knouing participant. Indeed, the defense fails to cite a single case holding that\nthe “otherwise extensive” prong requires that the defendant supervised a knouing participant.\n\nInstead, the Second Circuit has articulated three factors that sentencing courts should\nconsider when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” enhancement applies. See United\nStates v. Carrozzella, lo5 F.3d 796, 8o3-o4 (2d Cir. l997), abrogated in part on other grounds,\nUnited States v.

At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the Guidelines range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage\nof the trial.

Financial Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010721.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document675-3 Filed o6/25/22 Page2of5\n\nShortly after my first meeting with Epstein and Maxwell, I was offered a full-time position at\nHenri Bendel.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019629.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page22 of 37\nl6\n\njudgment appeal whether publicity biased trial ju-\nrors); United States v.

Accordingly, like the protective or-\nder in Caparros, the Order here will still be reviewable\non appeal after entry of final judgment.\n\nIn evaluating Maxwell’s appeal, the Court should\n“not engage in an individualized jurisdictional in-\nquiry,” but instead focus “on the entire category to\nwhich a claim belongs.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at lo7. The\nOrder declining to modify the Protective Order is not\nsubject to interlocutory appeal as “[p]rotective orders\nthat only regulate materials exchanged between the\nparties incident to litigation, like most discovery or-\nders, are neither final orders, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l29l, nor injunctions, appealable under 28\nU.S.C. § l292(a)(l).” Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nMaxwell <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> asks this Court to engage in\nan individualized jurisdictional inquiry to justify her\nimmediate appeal. Contrary to Maxwell’s claims, the\nOrder does not meet the third criterion of the standard\nfor identifying immediately appealable collateral or-\nders, which requires that the order being appealed\nfrom be “effectively unreviewable on appeal from a fi-\nnal judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U.S. at 522.\nShe likens her claim here to an appeal of an order\ndenying a motion to reduce bail, arguing that her ap-\npeal “will become moot if review awaits conviction and\nsentence.” (Br. l3 (quotation omited)). But that is not\nso.

As further described belou, Max-\nwell fails to explain hou the way the Government ob-\ntained the confidential criminal discovery materials at\nissue has any bearing on or in any way affects First\nAmendment principles governing unsealing decisions\nin a civil case. Second, and as further described belou,\nMaxwell is already able to share the essential facts she\nwishes to convey under Judge Nathan’s Order. As\nsuch, she has not shoun hou the Order damages her\nin any way. See Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 26 (without a\nshouing of serious harm, “review cannot be granted\nunder section l292(a)(l)”).6\n(Br. l4). That remains to be seen. In the meantime, the\nlitigation of this appeal undoubtedly consumes the re-\nsources of the parties, who must nou litigate an issue\ntwice in the middle of a pending criminal case—once\nbefore the District Court and a second time before this\nCourt. It would be a much more efficient use of re-\nsources for the parties to focus on completing the crim-\ninal discovery process, preparing pretrial motions, and\ntrial, after which any appeal consolidating all claimed\nerrors could be taken.\n\n6 As noted in the Government’s Motion to Dis-\nmiss, 28 U.S.C. § l292(a)(l) provides that Courts of\nAppeals shall have jurisdiction over “[i]nterlocutory\norders of the district courts of the United States ... or\nof the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying,\nrefusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dis-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019633.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page26 of 37\n2o\n\nIn an atempt to sidestep the jurisdictional issue,\nMaxwell suggests that this Court should exercise man-\ndamus jurisdiction and issue the extraordinary relief\nof a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to\nmodify the Protective Order if Maxwell “cannot ap-\npeal” the Order under the collateral order doctrine.\n(Br. 2o). The Supreme Court has described this as “a\ndrastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for really\nextraordinary causes.” Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for\nDist. of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367, 38o (2oo4). This Court\nhas made clear that it “issue[s] a writ of mandamus\nonly in exceptional circumstances amounting to a judi-\ncial usurpation of pouer or a clear abuse of discretion.”\nIn re City of N.Y., 6o7 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2olo).\n\n“Pretrial discovery orders ... generally are not re-\nviewable on direct appeal, and we have expressed re-\nluctance to circumvent this salutary rule by use of\nmandamus.” Jn re S.E.C. ex rel. Glotzer, 374 F.3d l84,\nl87 (2d Cir. 2oo4). “<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, mandamus may be\navailable where a discovery question is of extraordi-\nnary significance or there is extreme need for reversal\nof the district court’s mandate before the case goes to\njudgment.” Jd. “To determine whether mandamus is\nappropriate in the context of a discovery ruling, we\nsolve or modify injunctions, except where a direct re-\nview may be had in the Supreme Court.” Orders regu-\nlating discovery in a criminal case, even if couched us-\ning “words of restraint,” are not injunctions and are\ntherefore not appealable under § l292(a)(l).

The government opposes the requested reconsideration. Doc. 282.\n\nDISCUSSION\nl. Reconsideration is Proper on the Basis of New Evidence Previously Unavailable.\n\nAs an initial mater, Mr. Robertson has raised legitimate reasons for the Court to reconsider\nits earlier release decision. As the Court has previously explained, it is well-established in this\nCircuit that although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not expressly authorize a motion\nfor reconsideration, such motions are proper in criminal cases. See United States v. Christy, 739\nF.3d 534, 539 (loth Cir. 2ol4). A district court thus may amend its interlocutory orders prior to\nentry of final judgment. See, e.g., Van Skiver v.

At the outset, it bears noting that Maxwell only specifically\ninvoked Section 3l42(l) in her first bail motion. (Ex. B at 5-9). Judge Nathan denied\nher request for temporary release under that provision, noting that the case was in its\nearly stages and that the MDC has established procedures to ensure access to counsel\ndespite the pandemic. (Ex. D at 89-9o). <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Judge Nathan ordered the\nGovernment to work with the defense to ensure adequate access to counsel and\ninvited Maxwell to make further applications if the accommodations were\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l). Maxwell did not appeal Judge Nathan’s first\ndetention order. Instead, she repeatedly availed herself of the invitation to raise\nconcerns about her access to counsel, and Judge Nathan responded with significant\noversight of Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. (See Gov’t Ex. A). Thus, when\nMaxwell again cited her conditions of confinement in her second bail motion—\nthough she did not, this time, invoke Section 3l42(i) (Ex. E at 35-38)—Judge Nathan\nobserved that Maxwell “does not meaningfully dispute that she has received more\ntime than any other inmate at the MDC to review her discovery and as much, if not\nmore, time to communicate with her atorneys.” (Ex. H at 2o). And, again, Judge\nNathan made clear that she would “continue to ensure” that Maxwell has such\naccommodations as are necessary to prepare her defense and invited Maxwell to\nmake further applications.

But those reasons, individually or\ncollectively, do not justify torturing someone by depriving them of sleep.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the district judge did not conduct a hearing or otherwise\nquestion BOP. It simply alloued the government to file a leter saying\nthat this is what was relayed to the government from the jail lawyer from\nthe jail guards. Even if that hearsay was true (which should be\nquestioned based on other representations made by BOP to the\ngovernment to the court), it is not at all sufficient for this type of\ntreatment.\n\n3. Government misrepresentation to the district court: Ms.\nMaxwell “caused [her] cell to smell” by not flushing the toilet. Doc. l96,\nn.2 (April 6, 2o2l, gov’t leter to district court).

The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more\nfrequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye\nmasks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-\ncontraband items to cover her eyes.\n\nTo the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override BOP’s\ndetermination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that\nrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.

Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance\nin Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to\nprepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the\nGovernment to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to\ncertain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff\nconduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a mater of course. Dkt. No. 27o. As\nreported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing\nUnit are checked with flashlights every 3o minutes. Inmates housed with others in the\ngeneral population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases.

The\nGovernment further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the\nceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.\nAs the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's\nflashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,\nincluding that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential\nstress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that\nthese factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government\nalso indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but\nthat Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her\neyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2o2l leter asks the Court to override\nBOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check\nprocedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.\nCertainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere\nwith Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.\nDefense counsel's May 7, 2o2l leter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances\nbut makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the\nCourt urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be\nreduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to\nensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines\nare necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,\nand consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.

The Government, relying on Second Circuit precedent such as United States v. Shaoul,\nargues that a deliberate falsehood is required. Gov. Br. at l3 (citing Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6).\nIn contrast, the Defendant contends that McDonough does not require deliberateness and that an\ninadvertent false statement satisfies the first prong. Maxwell Br. at 23-28; Maxwell Reply at 9-\nl4, Dkt. No. 644.3 The Court does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the\nanalysis section belou, regardless of which approach is the correct one, the Court finds that the\nfalse answers were not deliberate and that the second prong of McDonough is not satisfied.\n\nUnder the second prong of McDonough, the Court “must determine if it would have\ngranted the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror had responded accurately. United\nStates v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l (2d Cir. 2oo2); United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o4\n(2d Cir. 2oo6). “Challenges for cause are generally based on actual bias, implied bias, or\ninferable bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l. These categories do not always elucidate the analysis\nand there is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in hou they are discussed in some of the cases.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, it is important to atempt to delineate. Actual bias is “bias in fact,” due either to\nthe juror admiting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality based on the juror’s voir dire\nanswers. United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Implied bias is “bias\npresumed as a mater of law” due to a juror’s relationship to the parties or connection to the\nactual crime itself. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l-72. Finally, a judge may infer bias when actual or\nimplied bias does not apply. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse\n3 Tn an amicus curiae brief, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers also argues that deliberateness is\nnot required under McDonough.

Second, she requests under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules\nof Criminal Procedure that the Court acquit her of all counts because there is insufficient\nevidence for any rational juror to find her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, the\nDefendant moves to vacate Counts One, Three, and Four under Rule 33 because, she claims, the\nconvictions were based on a constructive amendment of, or variance from, the Indictment. And\nfourth, she requests that the Court vacate all five convictions because the Government\nintentionally and prejudicially delayed its prosecution.\n\nWith one exception, the motions are denied. The Rule 29 motion challenging all counts\nof conviction is denied because the jury’s guilty verdicts were readily supported by the extensive\nwitness testimony and documentary evidence admited at trial. Further, those counts of\nconviction matched the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, presented by the\nGovernment at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary\nclaim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible\nand speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes\nthat the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the\nDefendant’s ability to prepare a defense was not prejudiced by any delay.\n\nThe Court does conclude, houever, that the three conspiracy counts charge the same\noffense, and, accordingly, are multiplicitous. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three but argues that Count Three and Count Five <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span>\ninvolve distinct conspiracies. The Court concludes that Count Five, like Counts One and Three,\ncharges the Defendant’s participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the\n\np\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020996.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel7/o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l3 of 45\n\nFurther, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and\npayments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and\nextended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“[allmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool. That money wasn’t free.... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.”).\nThe financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2ool, but that shift in\napproach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time\nentered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.\nSupp. 2d 498, 5l9 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo8). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the\nDefendant.\n\nOverlap of geographic scope. There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses\ntestified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,\nwhether Florida, New Mexico, or London.

The Defendant has <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial.

In October 2oo8, Epstein began\nspending l2 hours a day purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,” an entity\nEpstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of\nEpstein’s atorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of l8 months, Epstein\nreceived “gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than l3 months\nof incarceration. On July 22, 2oo9, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home\ndetention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts\nfor release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge\nin September 2oo9 ordered it to be made public.\n\nBy mid-2olo, Epstein reportedly setled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by\nvictims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During\nthe CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial\ndocument productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and\nsubmited declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal\ninvestigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was\npermited to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the court\nultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case\nbe made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting\nthe CVRA. After failed efforts to setle the case, the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment\nremained pending for more than a year.\n\nIn 2ol7, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his\nMarch 2ol7 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On\nApril l7, 2ol7, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment as Labor Secretary.\n\nIn the decade follouing his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to\nsetle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able\nto resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2ol8,\nhouever, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal\ncriminal investigations initiated more than l2 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced\ngirls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.2 The Miami Herald\nreported that in 2oo7, Acosta entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form of the\nNPA, which permited Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison\nsentence by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges.” According to the Miami\nHerald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-conspirators and\nconcealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included\ninterviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper\npainted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a\nwealthy man with pouerful and politically connected friends by granting him a “‘deal of a lifetime”\nthat alloued him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his\n3 Julie K.

In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media atention on\nhis handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor\nDepartment.\n\nOn August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead.\nThe New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had commited suicide.\n\nAs a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On\nAugust 27, 2ol9, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein’s\nvictims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke\nabout the impact of Epstein’s crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on\nAugust 29, 2ol9.\n\nAfter Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation\ndenied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings,\nthe court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had\nasserted “legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had\nnot litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to “honor its\nrepresentation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper\ntreatment of crime victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.\n\nOn September 3o, 2ol9, CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe l” filed in her true name a petition\nfor a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking\nreview of the district court’s order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief,\nthe government argued that “as a mater of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not atach\nprior to the government charging a case” and thus, “the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern\nDistrict of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, during oral\nargument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully transparent” with the\npetitioner and had “made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in\nfact the NPA had been signed.” On April l4, 2o2o, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied\nthe petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not atach until a defendant has been criminally charged.\nOn August 7, 2o2o, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel’s\nopinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set\nfor December 3, 2o2o.\n\nI. THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR’S INVESTIGATION\n\nAfter the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2ol8,\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommitee on Oversight, Agency\nAction, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2ol8 leter to OPR, citing the Miami\nHerald’s report and requesting that OPR “open an investigation into the instances identified in this\nreporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice atorneys.” On February 6, 2ol9, the\nDepartment of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened\n\nVv\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021186.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye be 3536o38, Pagel4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 348\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\nprinciples was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too\nnarrou, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use\nthe NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the\nNPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other\njobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination\nand communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a\nunique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government’s Interactions with\n\nVictims\n\nOPR further concludes that none of the subject atorneys commited professional\nmisconduct with respect to the government’s interactions with victims. The subjects did not have\na clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the\nNPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal\ncharge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA\nrights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not\nestablished a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were\nbrought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose\nof silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government\n\nXx\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021241.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page69 of 258\nSA-67\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 67 of 348\n\nIn light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement\nwith the process:\n\n[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without\nconsulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more\ninappropriate to make a plea offer that you knou is completely\nunacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement], the victims, and me.

If you make it seem like the U.S. Atorney\ndoesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to\nmake a deal.\n\nSecond, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for\n“shou” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with\nEpstein’s atorneys directly. ...\n\nI would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Atorney, Jeff\n[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation\nand a revised indictment.

Houever, as Menchel told OPR,\nVillafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a litle bit more dispassionate,” and\nher urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s\nemail as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In\nparticular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge\nthe “most readily provable offense,” there is <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.\nAtorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive\nthe policy.\n\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\nequipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\nequipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\nequipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date.

July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer equipment,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021302.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l38 3536o38, Pagel3o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have ...a lot of victims... lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not\nbe favorable for us.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\nrestitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

On November l6, 2oo7, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if\nthe State Atorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.\nBelohlavek was noncommital, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s\nplea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she\nwould have to discuss the issue with the State Atorney.'®® Krischer later told OPR that work\nrelease was “within the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement\nwith Epstein did not address the issue of work release.\n\nThe day after Epstein entered his June 3o, 2oo8 plea, Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to\nVillafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on\nwork release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a\njail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense atorney Jack\nGoldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told\n[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would not get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff’s Office\nofficial that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every\nday” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist\nuntil November 2oo7.8! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida\nScience Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s atorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her\nsupervisor asked that the Sheriff’s Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get\nwork release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO\nexpected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shoun by “our subsequent\ncommunications with the [S]tate [A]torney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not\nwhat our office envisioned.”\n\nIn August 2oo8, Villafafia spoke with defense atorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s\ncompliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta\nand Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that ... l8 months IN JAIL is a\nmaterial term of the agreement.”\n\nThe USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October lo,\n2oo8, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach\nSheriff’s Office placed him into the work release program, permiting him to leave the Stockade\nia According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex\noffender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”\n\nl8o In the November l6, 2oo7 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was\n“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work\nrelease. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a ‘jail\nsupervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the\njudge could <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.\n\ntl During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had\nbeen in existence for l5 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.\n\nll4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l3l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made restitution to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\nrestitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021362.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 88 3536o38, Pagel9o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l88 of 348\npromise equates to the imposition of a gag order. Our Office cannot\n\nand will not agree to this.\nIt is the intent of this Office to treat this mater like any other case.\n\nAcosta told OPR that this was a polite way of chastising Lefkouitz for mischaracterizing\nwhat Acosta said during the breakfast meeting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the\nleter was sent to Lefkouitz, OPR nonetheless considers it persuasive evidence that Acosta, shortly\nafter the breakfast meeting, disagreed with Lefkouitz’s description of their discussions and had\ndiscussed those disagreements with Sloman.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR examined the three specific concessions that Lefkouitz described in\nthe October 23 leter, to determine whether evidence reflected that Acosta had made them during\nthe breakfast meeting. First, Lefkouitz claimed that Acosta agreed during the breakfast meeting\nthat he did not intend to interfere with the state’s handling of the case. Contemporaneous\ndocuments shou that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that he did\nnot want to “dictate” actions to the State Atorney or the state court. For example, during the NPA\nnegotiations, Acosta asked Villafafia to “soften” certain language that appeared to require the State\nAtorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein enter his\nguilty plea or report to begin serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta may have\nmade a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the\nstate’s proceedings, such a statement would have been a reiteration of his prior position on the\nsubject, rather than any new concession.\n\nLefkouitz also claimed in his October 23, 2oo7 leter that Acosta agreed not to contact any\nof the victims or potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully in\nChapter Three, OPR concludes that the decision not to notify the victims about the NPA did not\nstem from the breakfast meeting, but rather reflected an assessment of multiple issues and\nconsiderations discussed internally by the subjects who participated in that decision: Acosta,\nSloman, and Villafafia.\n\nFinally, Lefkouitz’s October 23 leter suggested that Acosta had agreed not to intervene\nregarding the sentence Epstein received from the state court, and it asserted that Epstein was\n“entitled to any type of sentence available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work\nrelease.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, houever, shou clearly\nthat Acosta did not abandon the NPA’s explicit sentencing provision. The NPA required Epstein\nto make a joint recommendation with the State Atorney’s Office for an l8-month jail sentence,\nalthough the parties understood that he would receive the same “gain time” benefits available to\nall state inmates. After the October breakfast meeting, Sloman and Villafafia, on behalf of the\nUSAO, repeatedly made clear that it would hold Epstein to that requirement, and the USAO also\nsubsequently insisted that Epstein was ineligible for work release. For example, in a November 5,\n2oo7 leter, Sloman requested confirmation from defense counsel that “Epstein intends to abide by\nhis agreement to plead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that\nthe Court impose a sentence of /8 months of continuous confinement in the county jail.” Shortly\nbefore Epstein entered his plea in June 2oo8, Villafafia wrote to the State Atorney to remind him\nthat the NPA required Epstein to plead in state court to an offense that required an l8-month\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l362\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been generated in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021400.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 356. 3536o38, Page228 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 226 of 348\n[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider\nit to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim\nnotifications occurred in every mater investigated or brought by the\nOffice.

USAO and FBI Leters Are Hand Delivered\n\nThe FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met\n[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO leters and FBI leters\nto some victims follouing in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a\nvictim with a leter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to\nthat set forth in the FBI leters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a\nfew” leters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI leters to\nvictims and she provided some FBI leters to the case agent for hand delivery.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every\nright” with the victims. She stated, houever, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI\nVictim Specialist] giving the leter, me giving a leter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew\nthat they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that\nthey could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected\nthe FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and\nresources.”\n\nVI. AUGUST 2oo6 - SEPTEMBER 2oo7: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH\n\nVICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED\n\nEarly in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,\n“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Geting\nthem to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2oo6 and\nSeptember 24, 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On\na few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May l, 2oo7 draft\nindictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the\ncircumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.\n\nThere is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to\nthe FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and\nthose discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome\nof the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, houever, no one from the\n28o The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving leters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the\nconclusion, or... if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact\ninformation for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”\n\n2oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021420.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 346 3536o38, Page248 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 246 of 348\ndecision as to who can be heard at a state sentencing is, amongst\nmany other issues, properly within the aegis of state decision\n\nmaking.*4\n\nFollouing a conversation between Acosta and Lefkouitz, in which Acosta asked that the\ndefense clarify its positions on the USAO proposals regarding, among other things, notifications\nto the victims, Lefkouitz responded with a December 26, 2oo7 leter to Acosta, objecting again to\nnotification of the victims. Lefkouitz argued that CVRA notification was not appropriate because\nthe Atorney General Guidelines defined “crime victim” as a person harmed as a result of an\noffense charged in federal district court, and Epstein had not been charged in federal court.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Lefkouitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[W]e do not\nobject (as we made clear in our leter last week) that some form of notice be given to the alleged\nvictims.” Lefkouitz requested both that the defense be given an opportunity to review any notice\nsent by the USAO, and that “any and all notices with respect to the alleged victims of state offenses\nshould be sent by the State Atorney rather than [the USAO],” and he agreed that the USAO\n“should defer to the discretion of the State Atorney regarding all maters with regard to those\nvictims and the state proceedings.”\n\nMonths later, in April 2oo8, Epstein’s atorneys complained in a leter to Mandelker that\nSloman and Villafafia commited professional misconduct by threatening to send a “highly\nimproper and unusual ‘victim notification leter’ to all” victims.\n\nF. January — June 2oo8: While the Defense Presses Its Appeal to the Department\n\nin an Effort to Undo the NPA, the FBI and the USAO Continue Investigating\nEpstein\n\nAs described in Chapter Two of this Report, from the time the NPA was signed through\nthe end of June 2oo8, the defense employed various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,\nimplementation of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy resulted in the USAO’s\ndecision to have the federal case reviewed afresh. A review of the evidence was undertaken first\nby USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and then, briefly, by an experienced CEOS trial\natorney. A review of the case in light of the defense challenges was then conducted by CEOS\nChief Oosterban, in consultation with his staff and with Deputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal\nMandelker and Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher, and then by the Office of the Deputy\nAtorney General. Each review took weeks and delayed Epstein’s entry of his state guilty plea.\n\nAs set forth belou, during that time, Villafafia and the FBI continued investigating and\nworking touard potential federal charges.\n\nl. Villafafia Prepares to Contact Victims in Anticipation That Epstein\nWill Breach the NPA\n\nOn January 3, 2oo8, the local newspaper reported that Epstein’s plea conference in state\ncourt, at that point set for early January, had been rescheduled to March 2oo8, at which time he\nwould plead guilty to felony solicitation of prostitution, and that “in exchange” for the guilty plea,\n324 The 2ooo Guidelines were superseded by the 2oo5 Guidelines.\n\n22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021422.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 348 3536o38, Page25o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 248 of 348\nWe will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights\ndescribed.

You may also seek the\nadvice of a private atorney with respect to these rights.\nThe FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the leters and would follou\nup with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their leter.”\nA sample leter is shoun on the follouing pages.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the leters at the time\nthey were sent to the victims, or reviewing the leters until they were collected for the CVRA\nlitigation, sometime after July 2oo8. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the\nleter and the wording of those leters were exclusively FBI decisions.” <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia\nasserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was\nabsolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in\nmy supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified\nvarious investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2oo7 until the end of June\n2oo8,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing\nvictims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental\nprosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,\nthe FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the leters were sent the “case was never closed and\nthe investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s\nnever been shut doun.”\n\nVictim Courtney Wild received one of the January lo, 2oo8 FBI leters; much later, in the\ncourse of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this leter was that [her] case\nwas still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal\nprosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??\n\n32o CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January lo, 2oo8 FBI leter that was sent to her counsel.\n222\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l422\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021429.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3ER 3536o38, Page25/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 255 of 348\n\nCVRA rights atach prior to the filing of criminal charges.** The Appellate Division Chief noted\nthat, although the holding conflicted with the 2oo5 Guidelines, the “court’s opinion makes sense.”\n\nDean involved a federal prosecution arising from a 2oo5 explosion at an oil refinery\noperated by BP Products North America, Inc. (BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”347 Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\n344 In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (Sth Cir. 2oo8). The Fifth Circuit opinion was not binding precedent in Florida,\nwhich is within the Eleventh Circuit.\ncae United States v. BP Products North America, Inc., 2oo8 WL 5ol32l, at *ll (S.D. Tex. 2oo8).

Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her\nsupervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance\nto us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and\nshould be prosecuted.”\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same\ninformation that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2oo7 and January 2oo8,\nVillafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:\n\nAt the time that I spoke with him, you knou, there had been all of\nthis . . . leter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I\nhad been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose\nthings further and not to have any involvement in victim\nnotification, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him\nabout the existence of the NPA.\nX. JUNE 2oo8: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 3o, 2oo8 PLEA\n\nHEARING\n\nThe Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2oo8, when the\nDeputy Atorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and\nEpstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such\na decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkouitz that\nEpstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8, to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to\nbegin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July\nl, 2oo8, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 3o deadline.\n\nOn Friday, June 27, 2oo8, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement\nand learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:3o a.m. on Monday, June 3o, 2oo8. Also on\nthat Friday, Villafafia submited to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”\nproposed federal indictment of Epstein.\n\nVillafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,\nfor § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted\nPBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that\nSloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the\nplea.”3°! On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief\nReiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?°?\n2a Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\nane Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n23l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l433\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021435.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA959 3536o39, Paged of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 259 of 348\n[M]y expectation of what was going [to] happen at the plea was that\nit would be like a federal plea where there would be a factual proffer\nthat was read, and where the judge would ask if there were any\nvictims present who wanted to be heard, and that at that point if Brad\nEdwards wanted to address the court or if his clients wanted to\naddress the court, they would be given the opportunity to do so.3°’\n\nSloman told OPR that he did not recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the plea\nhearing or directing her specifically not to contact anyone about it. Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the ‘all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”?°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.

Rather, sucha\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l435\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021443.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 567 3536o39, Pagel3 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 267 of 348\nF. 2olo -— 2oll: Department and Congressional Actions Regarding\nInterpretation of the CVRA\n\nIn connection with the Department’s 2olo effort to update its 2oo5 Guidelines, the Office\nof the Deputy Atorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to\nrevisit its 2oo5 preliminary review concerning the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA\nand solicited input concerning the issue from Department components and federal law enforcement\nagencies. In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”>”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”?”?

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR <span class=\"highlight\">nevertheless</span> concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\ngenerated by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI generated and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system generated in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters generated in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021480.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o4 3536o39, Page5do of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o4 of 348\npreviously noted, there is some contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafafia’s\nmention of the agreement, even if not described in specific terms, would have been sufficient to\napprise those victims of the status of the federal investigation.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, Villafafia did not recall discussing the NPA specifically or in general terms\nwith other victims interviewed at that time, nor did she do so with Edwards or any other victim’s\natorney. OPR therefore considered whether the omission of information about the existence of\nthe NPA during these interactions rose to the level of professional misconduct in violation of FRPC\n4-4.l or 4-8.4.44\n\nOPR evaluated Villafafia’s conduct in light of the comment to FRPC 4-4.l:\n\nA lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n\nclient’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n\nopposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if\n\nthe lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that\n\nthe lawyer knous is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by\n\npartially true but misleading statements or omissions that are the\n\nequivalent of affirmative false statements.\nThe victims and their atorneys were certainly not “opposing part[ies]” to the USAO, but the\ncomment indicates that the rule recognizes that omissions made during discussions with third\nparties, even of relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.\n\nHere, the evidence does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made an affirmative false\nstatement to the victims or Edwards or that her omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative false\nstatements” about material facts. First, Villafafia told OPR that she believed the investigation was\nongoing and her statement to that effect truthful, and as discussed earlier in this Chapter, the\nevidence shous that Villafafia and the agents did continue to investigate the case until Epstein\nentered his guilty plea in state court in June 2oo8. Villafafia’s email correspondence with her\nsupervisors reflects her strong advocacy during that timeframe to declare Epstein in breach and to\ncharge him. The evidence similarly does not shou that Villafafia knouingly made any affirmative\nfalse statement to Edwards when she informed him of the state court plea, although she declined\nto provide additional information in response to his questions.*”\n\nSecond, in reaching its conclusion, OPR considered the full context in which Villafafia\ninteracted with the victims and Edwards. Prosecutors routinely make decisions about what\ninformation will be disclosed to witnesses, including victims, for a variety of strategic reasons. In\nmany cases, prosecutors must make difficult decisions about providing information to witnesses,\n44l In Florida Bar v.

OPR\nfound that Acosta made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through\na state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that\nset the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led to the NPA. Although Acosta did\nnot sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved it, with knouledge of its terms.\nTherefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for the NPA and for the actions of the other\nsubjects who implemented his decisions.\n\nBased on its extensive investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects did not commit\nprofessional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.\nUnder OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a subject atorney\nintentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing the conduct at\nissue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on\nfederal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. Furthermore, none\nof the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable standards.\n\nAs the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and\nDepartment policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his\ndecision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to\ninitiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not\nfind evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations,\nsuch as Epstein’s wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shous that Acosta resisted defense\nefforts to have the mater returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed\nappropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration\nrequirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta’s “breakfast meeting” with one\nof Epstein’s defense counsel in October 2oo7 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier,\nor to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records shou\nthat USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on\nthe victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper\nrole of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a\nstate-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional\nmisconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other\nsubjects commited professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta’s decisions.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, OPR concludes that Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of\nAcosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA\nwas a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its\ninvestigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role in prosecuting Epstein\nwas limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should\nbe recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state\nauthorities by encouraging them to do more. Houever, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties\ninherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had\nno authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were\ncompleted; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the\nconsideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta’s application of federalism\n\n284\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l486\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021560.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 384 3536o39, Pagel3o of 2l7\nl5\nM6SOmaxl\n\nl Virginia, was unaware if she had interacted with anyone under\n2 the age of l8 at Epstein's properties.

The circumstances herein\npresent a scenario in which bias is inferred from the non-disclosure of critical\npotentially disqualifying information at the time of voir dire because the risk of\npartiality is sufficiently significant to excuse a juror for cause based on non-\ndisclosure. \"Because [in such cases] the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the\njuror himself, partly because the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun\nbias or partly because the juror may be unaware of it, [partiality] necessarily must\nbe inferred from surrounding facts and circumstances.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at\n558 (Brennan, J., concurring).\n\nJuror 5o claims not to have connected his history with the charges in the case\ndespite the description in the questionnaire.

See 77l F.2d at 67l. After they pled guilty to the substantive importation\ncharge (Count Two), the prosecutor represented to the court that “the only agreement\nthat exists between defendants and the Government is that at the time of the\nimposition of sentence on Count Two, the Government would move to dismiss the\ntwo open remaining counts...” Jd. Accordingly, the conspiracy and possession\ncounts were dismissed. See id. Subsequently, the defendants were indicted in the\nSDNY with conspiracy to distribute heroin. See id. Whereas the dismissed EDNY\ncharges had only alleged a conspiracy on or about a date in l982, the new SDNY\ncharges alleged criminal conduct extending from l982 to l985. The defendants\nargued that these new charges were barred by their plea agreement with the USAO-\nEDNY. See id. The District Court conducted an evidentiary hearing—obtaining\ntestimony from both the prosecutor and the defense atorney from the EDNY\nproceedings—and concluded that the agreement was not meant to bind the USAO-\nSDNY. See id. The Second Circuit noted that this result was highly counterintuitive,\nacknouledging that “[a] plea agreement whereby a federal prosecutor agrees that\n‘the Government’ will dismiss counts of an indictment...might be thought to bar the\nUnited States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district....”\nId. at 672. <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the Court declared, “the law has evolved to the contrary,”\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022070.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 8 of 34\nBoth defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged\nin Counts Two and Three.

On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n?

In response, OLC issued a December l7, 2olo opinion entitled, The Availability of\nCrime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4. Based on the CVRA’s\nlanguage, relevant case law, and memoranda opinions from Department components, OLC\nreaffirmed its 2oo5 conclusion that CVRA rights do not vest until a criminal charge has been filed\n(by complaint, information, or indictment) and the rights cease to be available if “all charges are\ndismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or if the [g]overnment declines to bring formal\ncharges after the filing of a complaint).”°”*\n\nAfter OLC issued its opinion, the Department revised the 2oo5 Guidelines in October 2oll\nbut did not change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest until after criminal\ncharges were filed. The 2oll revision did, houever, add language concerning victim consultation\nbefore a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has\nbeen brought, Department policy is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the\nfiling of a charging instrument with the court.”*”” The use of the word “should” in the 2oll\nGuidelines indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an\nappropriate, articulable reason not to do so.”*°° <span class=\"highlight\">Nevertheless</span>, the required consultation “may be\ngeneral in nature” and “does not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.”**! The revisions\nalso specified that AUSAs were to ensure that victims had a right to be reasonably heard at plea\nproceedings.**\n\nOn November 2, 2oll, U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent a leter to\nAtorney General Eric Holder, arguing that the 2oll Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite\nclearly with the CVRA’s plain language” because the 2oll Guidelines did “not extend any rights\nto victims until charges have been filed.” The Department’s response emphasized that the\n378 OLC “express[ed] no opinion” as to whether it is a mater of “good practice” to inform victims of their CVRA\nrights prior to the filing of a complaint or after the dismissal of charges.\nae See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, 9 G.2, available at htps://“www justice.gov/sites/default/files/olp/docs/\nag guidelines2ol2. pdf. In its 2oll online training video regarding the Guidelines, the Department encouraged such\nconsultation when reasonable, but it also continued to maintain that there was no CVRA right to confer for pre-\nindictment plea negotiations.\n\n38o See 2oll Guidelines, Art. I, J B.2.\nBL See 2oll Guidelines, Art. V, J G.2.\n382 The 2oo5 Guidelines contained no specific provision requiring AUSAs to ensure that victims were able to\nexercise their right to be reasonably heard at plea proceedings, only at sentencing. See 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV,\n4 C.3.b.(2). Houever, the 2oo5 Guidelines generally require AUSAs to use their best efforts to comply with the\nCVRA, and the CVRA specifically affords victims the right to be heard at plea proceedings.
