See Erick G. Luna, Avoiding A “Carnival Atmosphere”: Trial Court Discretion\nand the Advocate—Witness Rule, l8 Whitier L.Rev. 447, 45l (l997). Among the multitude of\nrationales for the rule, rarely, if ever, will a lawyer be able to effectively serve as an advocate\nand give testimony:\n\nA lawyer who intermingles the functions of advocate and witness diminishes his\n\neffectiveness in both roles. The client's case is subject to the criticism that it is\n\nbeing presented through the testimony of an obviously interested witness who on\n\nthat account is subject to impeachment, and, of equal importance, the lawyer is\n\nplaced in the unseemly position of arguing his oun credibility to the jury.\nWilliams v. Dist. Ct., El Paso Cty., 7oo P.2d 549, 553 (Colo. l985).°\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell (“Colorado Counsel”) have direct, relevant, testimony\napplicable to the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations in Counts Five and Six, the\nquestions, the objections, and the lack of materiality of these questions. Testimony from\nColorado Counsel would likely include their knouledge about the many false statements made\nby Giuffre and the actions of her lawyers including discovery abuses. But operating in a dual\ncapacity, lawyer and witness, would create confusion, subject Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers to cross-\nexamination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, courts in this\nCircuit do not allou atorneys to function in this dual role, even if the defendant is willing. See\nUnited States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d lo64, lo74 (2d Cir. l982) (disqualification of trial\ncounsel “required” as a result of “their participation in the events underlying” one of the\ncharges); United States v. Goti, 77l F. Supp. 552, 565 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (disqualifying trial\ncounsel and noting that “[i]t is difficult to comprehend hou |the lawyers] could present a defense\nagainst this charge without becoming unsworn witnesses”). Here, the government suggests that\n\n®° Drafters of the ABA Model Rules recommend similar rationales for the rule; but the drafters\nalso mention the opposing party's interest, noting that combining the roles of advocate and witness can\nprejudice the opposing party as well as involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client.
