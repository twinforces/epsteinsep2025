It was expected that a connection would be found between the\nchild’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-\nmatic factor .. .” (Bornstein, l946, p. 23o).\n\ne “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,\nelevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of\nseduction with him...” (A. Freud, l968, p. 45).\n\ne “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual\nencounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself\nand enticing the child to follou suit, all the way to forcible rape”\n(Finch, l974, p. 34).\n\ne “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her oun\nseduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, l98o, p. 279).\n\nHere “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is\ngroomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal <span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span> or risk of disclosure.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 43\n29o — S. Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span>. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span> as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need.

The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span>\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006303.jpg": "ase l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-4 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 6of:\n32 journal of Interpersonal Violence 33(l)\n\ne “...

Craven et al.\nHouever, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect\naggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.\nHall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\nHall and Hirschman’s (l992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but\nit was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits\nan act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of\nopportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions\nthat act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is\nsuggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a\nthreshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems\nwith this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather\nthan an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need\nto be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it\ncan occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual\ngrooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,\nso once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.\nA further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model\nFinkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual\noffending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a\nresult of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s\nability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender\nnot being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;\nthe third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span>. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be\nsatisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,\nErooga & Becket, l994; Sampson, l994) have reviewed his work using this term. They\nreferred to overcoming the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span> as grooming.\nWard and Siegert’s Pathways Model\nWard and Siegert’s (2oo2) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological\nmechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual\narousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are\ninvolved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present\ntypically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five\npossible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the\nmost dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the\npsychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the\nabove is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still\nemphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; houever, the nature of\nsexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to\naccount for this.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6826\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification.

The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B)\n\nDoes Not Apply.\n\nFinally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the\ngrounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in\nprohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible\ndouble-counting to apply § 2Gl.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie\nFarmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully\naccounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double\ncounting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence\nto reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the\nGuidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 26l (2d Cir. 2ol2). Ms. Maxwell was\nconvicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual\nconduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] l2, 24, 27).'°\nWebster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to atract artfully or adroitly or by\narousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the\npresenting of an atraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or beter\njudgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to\nan act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of\n<span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span> or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for\n!o Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f\nl6-l9. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for\nCounts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of\nsentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order.

For instance, Government cooperators and\nconfidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their cooperation with the\nGovernment made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.\n\nThird, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional\nrights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered\n<span class=\"highlight\">resistance</span> from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be\npublicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Leter at 3), the defendant retains the right to\ncompulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the\nCourt anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl7(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a leter rogatory. See l8\nU.S.C. § l78l(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of\nperjury. See l8 U.S.C. § l62l. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be\ninterviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do so. And\nthe Government has the same pouers and limitations. Put simply, the defendant’s constitutional\nrights are not infringed if this Court follous the same rule as every other court in every other trial,\nhigh profile or not.\n\nIV.
