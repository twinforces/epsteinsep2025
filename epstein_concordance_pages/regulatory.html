Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4) (affirming district court order\nof pretrial release of defendant, a resident and citizen of Denmark-from where defendant\ncould not be extradited-charged with bulk cash smuggling and forfeiture, noting that the\n\n” This Court’s opinion in Zarrab stands only for the proposition that wealthy defendants should\nnot be provided an unfair advantage. It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and <span class=\"highlight\">regulatory</span> regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l49 of 375\nPark Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.\nPage 87\nMead Corporation, Dayton, OH, July ll-l2, 2ooo\nOrganization Resource Counselors (Corporate Medical Directors),\nWashington, DC, August l, 2ooo\n“Workplace Violence 8 East: An Intensive Course Designed for\nFortune 5oo Companies and Selected Private and Government\nOrganizations,” New York, NY, October 2-4, 2ooo\n“Investigation, Interviewing, and Termination,” New York, NY,\nOctober 5-6, 2ooo\nPaineWebber, Weehawken, NJ, December l2-l4, 2ooo\nAmerican Express, Phoenix, AZ, February 2o, 2ool\n“Workplace Violence 9: An Intensive Course Designed for\nFortune 5oo Companies and Selected Private and Government\nOrganizations,” Newport Beach, CA, April 23-25, 2ool\nThomson Legal & <span class=\"highlight\">Regulatory</span>, Egan, MN, April l5-l6, 2ool\nChiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA, May 3l, 2ool\nAllergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, June 5, 2ool\nAT&T Broadband, Englewood, CO, June l4, 2ool Jefferson\nCounty, Colorado, Golden, CO, June l5, 2ool\nFederated Department Stores (Arizona Mail Order), Tucson, AZ,\nJune l9-2o, 2ool\nCorning, Inc., Corning, NY, September ll, 2ool\nFederated Department Stores (Federated Marketing Group), New\nYork, NY, November l5-l6, 2ool\nPaineWebber, Weehawken, NJ, November l9-2o, 2ool\n“Workplace Violence lo: An Intensive Course Designed for\nFortune 5oo Companies and Selected Private and Government\nOrganizations,” Newport Beach, CA, April l5-l7, 2oo2\nTribune Company, Chicago, IL, May l5, 2oo2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7642\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007672.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l79 of 375\n\nReference Commitee on Amendments to Constitution and\nBylaws, AMA Interim Meeting, National Harbor, MD, November\n\n2ol4- 2ol5 Member, Nominating Commitee, American Academy of Psychiatry\nand the Law\n\n2ol4 Member, AMA-YPS HOD Handbook Review Commitee, AMA-\nYPS Annual Meeting, Chicago\n\n2ol4 Member, AMA-YPS HOD Reference Commitee on Amendments\nto Constitution and Bylaws, AMA Interim Meeting, Dallas\n\n2ol4 Chairman, AMA-YPS HOD Handbook Review Commitee for the\nReference Commitee B (Legislative Advocacy), AMA Interim\nMeeting, Dallas\n\n2ol4 - 2ol8 Member, Geriatric Psychiatry Commitee, American Academy of\nPsychiatry and the Law\n\n2ol6 - 2o2o Member, AIER Research Commitee, American Academy of\nPsychiatry and the Law Institute for Education and Research\n\n2ol6 — 2ol7 Chair, Long Range Planning Commitee, Southern Psychiatric\nAssociation\n\n2ol6 — 2ol7 Chair, Nominating Commitee, Southern Psychiatric Association\n\n2ol7 — 2ol8 Executive Commitee, Seminole County Medical Society\n\n2ol7 - 2ol8 Physician Wellness Task Force, Orange County Medical Society\n\n2ol8 - 2ol9 Oversight Commitee, Florida Psychiatric Society\n\n2ol8 Reference Commitee | — Health, Edu. & Public Policy, Florida\nMedical Association\n\n2ol9 - 2o2l Commitee on Physician Wellness, Florida Medical Association\n\n2ol9 — 2o2l Legislative and <span class=\"highlight\">Regulatory</span> Issues Commitee, Florida Psychiatric\nSociety\n\n2ol9 Reference Commitee — Science and Public Health, Florida\nMedical Association’s Delegate at the AMA’s Interim Meeting\n\n2ol9 — 2o2l Chair, Forensic Psychiatry Commitee, Florida Psychiatric Society\n\n3/2o2o — 2/2o24 Commitee on the Award for Research in Geriatric Psychiatry, The\nAmerican College of Psychiatrists\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7672\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 339 of 375\n-\nSumma Wise (~ FORENSIC\nRobert P.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and <span class=\"highlight\">regulatory</span> regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00026022.jpg": "Page 2253\nU.S Department of Justice Certification of Identity oy)\na\nFORM APPROVED OMB NO. llo3-ool6\nEXPIRES lo/3l/l3\nSSC\nPrivacy Act Statement.
