Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts.”\nExhibit 2, Jane Doe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla. July 5, 2ol3),\nDkt. 2o5-2, at 9. The government went so far as to invite the alleged victims “to contact the\nUnited States Atorney’s Office in those districts and seek to confer with government atorneys\nin those offices about investigating and potentially prosecuting Epstein based on the alleged\nfederal crimes commited against them.” /d. at lo. The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions. See id. at lo n.9.\n\nThe defense strongly disagrees with the premise that the government can offer and\nexecute an immunity or nonprosecution agreement with a citizen in the location of one of two\nvenues where an interstate telephone call (or flight or any form of wire or mail communication)\noccurs and then circumvent the consequences of that immunity grant by having the very same\nprosecution office promote and motivate a prosecution by another office at the second venue of\nwhat in fact was a single criminal transaction. What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest. During that time, as noted by the\ngovernment, he engaged in substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, always returning to his residences in\nthe United States. Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee. This fact significantly undermines the government’s contentions\nregarding risk of flight and indicates Mr. Epstein’s good-faith intent to contest the charges\npending against him.\n\nOn September 24, 2oo7, after a year-long investigation, the Department of Justice,\nthrough the United States Atorney for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), entered\ninto the NPA with Mr. Epstein. The NPA immunized Mr. Epstein from five distinct potential\nfederal charges that “may have been commited by Epstein . . . from in or around 2ool through\nin or around September 2oo7.” Exhibit l, NPA, at l-2. One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added). Senior officials at the Department\nof Justice reviewed the NPA and either authorized or helped negotiate the resolution of the\nmater. See, e.g., United States’ Second Supplemental Privilege Log filed as Dkt. 329-l in Jane\nDoe #l and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, No. o8-CV-8o736 (S.D. Fla.)

Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v.

It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000286.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 - Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l3 of l6\n\n“bail statute does not . . . require that foreign defendants be detained simply because their\n\nreturn cannot be guaranteed through extradition”);\n\ne United States v.

See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (reversing district court order of\ndetention despite finding that defendants, natives of Indonesia, faced “lengthy term of\nincarceration” and “strong” evidence of guilt existed); Karni, 298 F.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal financial submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000335.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 7 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or.

The Department of Justice’s Office of\n<span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000343.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l of lo\n.)

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, and his significant <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000345.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page3oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nAs has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he ouns and\nmaintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhatan, New York;\nPalm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France.

The\ninvestigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews\nwith victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count\nOne of the instant Indictment.\"\n\nIn fall 2oo7, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in\nconnection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement\nidentified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach\narea. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant\nwas never charged federally.” In June 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count\nof procuring a person under the age of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation\nof prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with\nregistration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.\n\n' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed belou, was entered into at the conclusion of\nthe SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.\nAs noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who\nwere abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.\n\n> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further belou, it is well-established in the\nSecond Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is\nnot bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in another district.

The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000352.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page looflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage lo\nCONCLUSION\nAs set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The\ndefendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious\noffenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction\nof which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In\nsum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and\nounership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a\nsuccessful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse\ndozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,\nintimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his\ndangerousness readily apparent.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not\nbe able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there\nare no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this\ncase or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.\nVery truly yours,\nGEOFHREY S.

Mr. Epstein is 66 and is reported to be a self made multi-millionaire. He did |\nnot graduate from college.

Epstein, |\nl55 F.Supp.2d 323, 326 (E.D.

The Defense package components would embroil the Court in issues, among others, |\nrelating to the level of force that may be used to secure the Defendant, who may enter the |\nresidence, daily reporting by Mr. Epstein, and reporting by so-called Trustee(s) designated to live |\nwith and supervise Mr. Epstein. See United States v. Valerio, 9 F.

And, it comes into pay only after Mr. Epstein has |\nfled the Court’s jurisdiction. According to the Government, “The Department of Justice’s Office |\nof <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an |\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding.

The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000871.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRNG6S/22/Phg Rage of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo87l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000873.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-oo28MAdhn db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/PagPeyefiWof l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000952.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAGH2o2 P ahage of aiooo\n\ndate of the amendment,! to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim.

Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, including at least fifteen <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000954.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBROHAGN 2OdtUMENt/2o FilecOOAG2o2 P ahage of Gfooo\n\nThe defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case,\nwhich has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the\nUnited States. Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she\nhas not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press\narticles began turning the public’s atention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for\nEpstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s\ninvestigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be\nvictims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.\nDespite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was\nredirected touard her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave\nthe country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was\narrested.

There is no refutation from the government on that,\nl3 and they have been all over her travel records. The defendant\nl4 has resided here in the past year. She has traveled\n\nl5 internationally and, according to the government, she has\n\nl6 financial means. I will get to that in a moment, Judge. But\nl7 let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has\nl8 financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.\nl9 What do those cases teach? They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions. They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all. In\n23 Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the\n24 defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years,\n25 and they had many more <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties or <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001074.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel33 of 2oo 7o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl risk of flight or dangerousness, they are still entitled to the\n\n2 same Sixth Amendment rights to access defense counsel to\n\n3 prepare their case.\n\n4 MR.

My point is that the facts in those cases\n\n6 are different from our case in a meaningful way and the court\n\n7 was doing a different evaluation. That was the point I was\n\n8 making on this case.\n\n9 So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case\nlo for bail. We believe that the government, which has the burden\nll of persuasion that never shifts, has not made a shouing as\nl2 reguired, that our client is a risk of flight. When you\nl3 consider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the\nl4 actual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when\nl5 you consider that the only factors they really point to are\nl6 ones that the cases have already addressed, such as\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel and passports.\n\nl8 We also submit that the government has not carried its\nl9 burden of shouing there is no condition or combination of\n2o conditions that secure release.\n2l So we would ask the court to grant bail today.

That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances. The defense's argument, in essence, atempts to\n2o view each of the government's arguments as absolute.

After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight.

The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001161.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeaGecil I Ob 36\nthe jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee). The Department of\nJustice’s Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001173.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeagecd l Ob 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk.

As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.

Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8.

Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool22o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001248.jpg": "Caseel24o/fRooBBoHAEN Add uMeht /LOF l FiedsasO9F2Ag ePageb lGho\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span>\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth.

The request was made in the context of ongoing bail\nproceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”),\nwhere Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in\nsexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from l994 to l997.\n\n2.

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be\nthe nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo.

Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention.

And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001281.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF ib 837222/2agFidgec’ o642\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001283.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G ANA B6cuMe?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ol65l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Second, Judge Nathan determined that “[t]he government’s evidence at\nthis early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple victims who\nprovided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as\nwell as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.).

Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for discovery.

Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, including at least fifteen <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooool493\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 9 of lo\n\nThe defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001597.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l7 of 26\ncases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in\nthose cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case,\nwhich has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the\nUnited States. Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she\nhas not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press\narticles began turning the public’s atention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for\nEpstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s\ninvestigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be\nvictims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.\nDespite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was\nredirected touard her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave\nthe country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was\narrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v.

As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw.

Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court.

The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

The defendant has three passports. The\nll defendant has traveled internationally in the past, not in the\nl2 past year. There is no refutation from the government on that,\nl3 and they have been all over her travel records. The defendant\nl4 has resided here in the past year. She has traveled\n\nl5 internationally and, according to the government, she has\n\nl6 financial means. I will get to that in a moment, Judge. But\nl7 let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has\nl8 financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.\nl9 What do those cases teach? They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions. They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all. In\n23 Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the\n24 defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years,\n25 and they had many more <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties or <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool926\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001947.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 7o of 9l 7o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl risk of flight or dangerousness, they are still entitled to the\n\n2 same Sixth Amendment rights to access defense counsel to\n\n3 prepare their case.\n\n4 MR.

My point is that the facts in those cases\n\n6 are different from our case in a meaningful way and the court\n\n7 was doing a different evaluation. That was the point I was\n\n8 making on this case.\n\n9 So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case\nlo for bail. We believe that the government, which has the burden\nll of persuasion that never shifts, has not made a shouing as\nl2 required, that our client is a risk of flight. When you\nl3 consider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the\nl4 actual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when\nl5 you consider that the only factors they really point to are\nl6 ones that the cases have already addressed, such as\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel and passports.\n\nl8 We also submit that the government has not carried its\nl9 burden of shouing there is no condition or combination of\n2o conditions that secure release.\n2l So we would ask the court to grant bail today.

JJ] 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding.

Athe bail hearing of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on l4 July 2o2o, the US Government made\n\nthe follouing point in support of its motion to detain the defendant:\n“The government has spoken with the Department of Justice ataches in the\nUnited Kingdom and France.

The <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell and her French nationality appear as one\nof the grounds for which bail was denied by the Court, which found that:\n\n“Ms Maxwell’s history and characteristics support the position of her posing a risk of\nflight. Ms Maxwell has substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and could facilitate living abroad\nif she were to flee the United States.

It will first set out the various steps of the French extradition procedure (Part I, and\nthen outline the grounds on which extradition requests are analyzed under French law,\nand especially the status of the rule against extradition of nationals, in order to assess the\napplication of these principles to an extradition request made by the USA, in particular\nwhere, as in this case, the requested person has executed an irrevocable waiver of his/her\nright to contest extradition and is present in France only because she fled the United\nStates in violation of her bail conditions.

Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-l) sets out\nlegislative provisions pertaining to extradition.\n\n53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states\nthat extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and\nthat nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition\nis sought (« Extradition is not granted: l° When the person sought has the French\nnationality, the later being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is\nrequested. »»”’),\n\n54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\nconvention stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule\nagainst the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal\nProcedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.\n\n55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France l996”, which supersedes French law\nas mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n56. Article 3(l) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a\nperson who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the\nUnited States shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if,\nin its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought\nshall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n27 Tn French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordee : l° Lorsque la personne reclamee a la nationalite francaise, cete\nderniere etant appreciee a l'epoque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».\n28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure: “In the absence of an <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> convention stipulating\notherwise, the conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter.\nThese provisions shall also apply to maters which would not have been regulated by <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> conventions”. (In\nFrench, « En l'absence de convention internationale en stipulant autrement, les conditions, la procedure et les\neffets de l'extradition sont determines par les dispositions du present chapitre. Ces dispositions s'appliquent\negalement aux points qui n'auraient pas ete reglementes par les conventions internationales »).\n° The Extradition treaty between the USA and France was signed in Paris on April 23, l996 and entered into force\non February l, 2oo2 (by Decree No. 2oo2-ll7 of 29 January 2oo2).\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l7\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002143.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page l9 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n57. If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought, Article\n3(2) requires the requested State to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if\nso requested by the requesting State.\n\n58. Consequently, the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not\ncontain any prohibition on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it merely states that\nthere is no obligation upon the requested State to grant the extradition of a person who\nis one of its nationals.\n\n59. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA must therefore be distinguished\nfrom several <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> agreements on extradition ratified by France, which, by\ncontrast, contain a clear rule against the extradition of French citizens*?.\n\n6o. For example, France has made the follouing declaration pursuant to Article 6 of the\nEuropean Convention on Extradition l957, which gives Contracting States “the right to\nrefuse extradition of nationals”:\n\n“Extradition shall be refused when the person sought had French nationality at the time\nof the alleged offence’.\n\n6l. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European Convention on\nExtradition”.\n\n62. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA is similar to other <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\nagreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against the\nextradition of nationals. These are generally treaties signed with Common law\njurisdictions, which do not oppose the extradition of their nationals*’.\n\n3° See, for example, the Extradition treaty between France and Morocco, or the Extradition treaty between France\nand China.\n3! See France’s instrument of ratification of the European Convention on Extradition, deposited on lo February\nl986.\n32 The European Convention on Extradition l957 is an instrument of the Council of Europe which was signed in\nParis on December l3, l957 and came into force on April l8\", l96o. The European Convention on Extradition\nis open to signature by non-Council of Europe States, as such it was ratified by South Africa, Israel, and the\nRepublic of Korea. It was ratified by France on February lo\", l986.\n33 For example, the Extradition Treaty between France and Canada, signed in Otawa on l7 November l988,\ncontains a similar provision to the United States Treaty: “The requested State shall not be bound to extradite its\noun nationals.

The wording of these <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> agreements, which do not contain a prohibition on\nthe extradition of nationals, raises some important questions.

In order to determine whether the French government may grant an extradition request\nrelating to a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA, it\nis thus necessary to evaluate the strength and status of the prohibition of the extradition\nof nationals under (i) applicable <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> law, (i) European law, and (i) French\nconstitutional law.\n\n7) <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> law\n\n65. As outlined, <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> treaties pertaining to extradition generally leave Contracting\nStates a right not to extradite their nationals, and State practice largely varies in this\nregard. Some States are strongly commited to the rule against the extradition of nationals\nand have conferred the principle constitutional status (Germany, Poland, Greece,\nPortugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have codified the principle in their national legislation\n(France, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many States - in particular,\nCommon law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,\nextradite their oun citizens.\n\n66. Thus, there is no uniform rule regarding the extradition of nationals under <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\nlaw.\n\n(i) European law\n\n67. European law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals either. As mentioned, Article\n6 of the European Convention on Extradition l957 provides States with a discretionary\nright on whether or not to extradite their oun citizens.\n\n68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision of l3 June 2oo2\n(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which governs extradition maters between Member States of\nthe European Union, does not allou Member States the possibility to refuse the surrender\nof their nationals when the EAW is issued for the purpose of conducting a criminal\nprosecution. In fact, the surrender of a national who is the subject of criminal proceedings\nin another Member State of the European Union is at the cornerstone of the EAW FD.\n\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - l9\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2l of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n69. Articles 3 and 4 of the EAW FD set out a number of grounds for refusing the enforcement\nof a EAW, that are respectively mandatory and optional. Article 4(6) on optional grounds\nprovides that a Member State may refuse the execution of a EAW « issued for the\npurposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order, where the requested\nperson is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing Member State and that\nState undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its\ndomestic law ». This article is the only provision in the EAW FD that allous Member\nStates to consider nationality in the execution of a EAW. As such, nationality can only\nact as a bar to the execution of a EAW issued for the purpose of executing a custodial\nsentence, not conducting a criminal prosecution.\n\n7o. It follous that European Union law does not prohibit the extradition of nationals.\n\n(i) French constitutional law\n\n7l. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French law,\nthe fact that France did not have to change its Constitution or domestic laws regarding\nthe extradition of nationals to incorporate the EAW FD effectively means that the\nprohibition against the surrender of a French citizen to foreign authorities does not\nconstitute an absolute prohibition per se under French law™*.\n\n72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional Court) has long considered that France\ncould not ratify an <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> amendment which went against the Constitution, thereby\nnecessitating a modification of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the\npurported <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> treaty*>. For example, the Constitution had to be amended prior to\nthe ratification of the Rome Statute, to create an exception to the rule that the President of\nthe Republic cannot be found criminally liable in respect of acts commited during his\nmandate. By contrast, the provisions of the Rome Statute which require Contracting Parties\nto surrender their nationals when the jurisdiction of the <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Criminal Court is\nestablished did not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,\nthe example of the Rome Statute must be taken as evidence that there is no constitutional\nprinciple against the extradition of nationals in France.\n\n34 By contrast, several Member States of the EU such as Germany, Poland or Cyprus, had to amend their national\nconstitutions prior to incorporating the EAW FD, follouing constitutional courts’ rulings.\n35 Decision No. 98-4o8 DC, 22 Janvier 2oo9.\n5l, rue Ampere - 75ol7 paris - tel. ol 88 33 5l 8o — fax. ol 88 33 5l 8l wj@wjavocats.com - 2o\nwww.wjavocats.com - palais Cl652\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-22 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 22 of 3o\nWilliam JULIE\navocat a la cour — atorney at law\n\n73. The Conseil d’Etat was once asked by the French government to deliver an opinion\nprecisely on this point. It stated that the government’s practice of refusing the extradition\nof nationals “finds no basis in a principle of constitutional value. None of the rights and\nliberties of the citizen, as proclaimed by the Declaration of the Rights of Men and\nCitizens of l789 and by the preamble of the Constitution of l946, implies that nationals\ncannot be extradited [...] No doubt the laws adopted and the <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> conventions\nsigned by France atest to the authority of the rule that nationals are not extradited. But,\nin support of this rule, there are no grounds for considering it as a fundamental principle\nrecognized by the laws of the Republic, having constitutional value by virtue of the\nPreamble to the Constitution of l946. »*®.\n\n74. Therefore, the French Constitution does not prevent the executive from extraditing\nFrench citizens.\n\n75. It follous from this opinion and the above that the decision to apply the principle against\nthe extradition of nationals is a mater for the executive, which could choose not to\nenforce it and thus choose to extradite a national without violating French constitutional\nlaw, European law or <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> law, taking into account the provisions of the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France of 23 April l996 which supersede\nFrench law and do not prohibit the extradition of French nationals.\n\nConclusion\n\n76. In the event that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France and become the subject\nof an extradition request, and where she has already executed an irrevocable waiver of\nher right to contest extradition, the Investigating Chamber would have to rule on the\nlegality of the extradition request in accordance with the procedure described in Part I.\nBecause the extradition of French nationals is not prohibited by the Constitution or the\nExtradition Treaty between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber would not\nbe legally bound to oppose to the extradition request. It would then become a mater for\nthe French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against\nMs Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n77.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002180.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l9 of 36\nthe jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee). The Department of\nJustice’s Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3l of 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. o3 Cr. 947 (SAS),\n2oo4 WL l6979o, at *l, *3 (S.D.N.Y.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002202.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo-2 Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3 of 4\n[logo]\nMINISTRY\nOF JUSTICE\nLiberty Directorate of Criminal Affairs and Pardons\nEquality\nFraternity\nSpecialized Criminal Justice Sub-Directorate\nOffice for the <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Mutual Assistance in Criminal Maters\nParis, December ll, 2o2o\nMr. Keeper of the Seals, Minister of Justice\nto\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ)\nThrough Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate\nEmbassy of the United States of America in Paris\n\nI have the honor to inform you that Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure\nprovides that France can extradite \"any person not having French nationality,” it being specified that\nnationality is assessed on the day of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested\n(Article 696-4 l°).\n\nThe French Code of Criminal Procedure therefore absolutely prohibits the extradition of a\nperson who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is\nrequested.\n\nThe penal law being of strict interpretation, there is no reason to discriminate between\nnationals and binationals.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, ] am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22™ 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars\nunavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to\nconceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made\nin relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances\nwhere she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her\nextradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her\nbail.

According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7.

As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page ll of 22\nCOVID-l9 related travel restrictions. /d. at 83:2l—83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. /d. at\n84:4-84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—-83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument.

Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated disclosure of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early disclosure can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial.

(Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span>\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2753\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002754.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 7 of 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002758.jpg": "¥& ; l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65-l Filed o3/o9/2l Page 2 of 2\nMINISTRY OF JUSTICE\nLiberty Directorate of Criminal Affairs & Pardons\nEquality\nFraternity\nSpecialized Criminal Justice Sub-Directorate\n<span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Criminal Assistance Bureau\nParis, March 9, 2o2l\nHis Honor the Keeper of Seals, Minister of Justice\nTo the\nDepartment of Justice (D.O.J)\nThrough Andrew FINKELMAN, Liaison Magistrate on behalf of the\nEmbassy of the United States of America located in Paris, France\n\nThereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are\ngoverned by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nArticle 696-2 of said Code provides that: “The French government is able to remit to\n\nforeign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a\nlawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said\nrequesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic.”\n\nArticle 694-4 expressly specifies as follous:\n\n“Removal is not granted:\n\nl- When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been\n\nassessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being\n\nrequested.”\n\nWHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an\ninsuperable obstacle to his/her removal.

The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002774.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 8 of l2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2774\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page lo of l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be\nthe nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French nationality, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request. Both the Treaty and the French Code of\n\nl Other relevant <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> treaties include: the Agreement on Extradition between the United States of\nAmerica and the European Union signed in Washington on 25 June 2oo3, and the Instrument Amending the\nTreaty of 23 April l996 between the United States of America and France signed in the Hague on 3o September\n2oo4.\n2\n5l, RUE AMPERE - 75ol7 PARIS - TEL.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\n<span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003546.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial protection for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality.

When Jane Doe #3\nbegan giving Epstein a “massage,” Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as\nthey had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and\nwith the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”\nEpstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about l999 through 2oo2, when she managed to\nescape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.4 Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime. He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n+ Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein?

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\n<span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3o7 Filed o6/25/2l Page3of2l\n\nFollouing entry of the protective order, Maxwell testified in two depositions in the civil\ncase.

Counts\nfive and six of the Sl superseding indictment in this case (and counts seven and eight of the S2\nsuperseding indictment) charge that Maxwell made false statements under oath in each of the\ndepositions.\n\nThe Government represents that the Office of the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District\nof New York formally opened its investigation into Epstein on November 3o, 2ol8, follouing a\nseries of articles in the Miami Herald about Epstein’s conduct and the lenient plea deal he\nreceived in the Southern District of Florida. The same day, the AUSA who atended the\nFebruary 2ol6 meeting forwarded the emails she received from atorneys in the civil case to the\nprosecutors working on the fledgling investigation.

BSF informed the Government that many of\nthe requested documents fell under the protective order.

The\nGovernment made a second, similar application in connection with a protective order in a\ndifferent case.\n\nThe judge who presided over the civil case passed away in March 2ol9, and so then-\nChief Judge McMahon heard the Government’s ex parte application. In a hearing on March 26,\n2ol9, Judge McMahon explained that she believed the Second Circuit’s decision in Martindell v.\n<span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), governed the\nGovernment’s application.

Affirming the louer court, the Second |\nCircuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially\nappropriate to require a higher shouing, because the Government both (i) possesses |\nextraordinary police pouers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and\n(i) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |\nof a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod.

In the Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8S. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (‘Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005890.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force. No individual has done more to share this insight\nwith the <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> law enforcement community than Ken Lanning, whose\nwritings and teachings have also reached mental health professionals, those\nwho work in the criminal justice and social service systems, those who care\nfor the nation’s children, and countless concerned citizens and parents.\n\nThe application of the terms “seduction” or “grooming” to these nonforce-\nful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent techniques has been in the service of dis-\nseminating this important insight, which first burst into public consciousness\nas a real possibility in the mid-l98os as a result of partially untrue media\nreports about the McMartin School case and the case of Father Gilbert Gauthe,\nboth of which stories first broke in l984. Yet even today, far too many people,\nincluding many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the possibil-\nity of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation,\nas their preconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are\ntoo strong to allou them to accept that children can be so readily manipulated\ninto doing or allouing things that others find abhorrent.\n\nGrooming\n\nLanning (2ol8) is precisely correct in dating to the l98os the use of the term\n“erooming” to refer to techniques for gaining sexual access to children and in\nhis observation that during the l98os, this usage gradually increased. Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983. The first publication identified by Google Scholar\nas using the term “grooming” in this way was an article by Conte (l984) cit-\ning Groth and Birnbaum (l979) for the proposition that “[i]n most cases,\nexcept those involving abuse by a stranger, the perpetrator involves children\nin sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a combination of kind-\nness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo589o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005896.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of\n\nDietz 35\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-\n\ncation of this article.\n\nNote\n\nl.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary financial resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her financial situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her financial resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant financial resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87). The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent\nconduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the\ndefense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.).

The Court was unpersuaded by the defendant’s offer to consent to extradition, noting\nthat the “legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained\n“fundamentally unchanged.” (/d. at ll-l3). The Court further explained that the defendant’s\n“extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at l3).\n\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant’s “patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly” on its assessment of her history\nand characteristics. (/d. at l5). In so doing, the Court highlighted that in July 2o2o the defendant\nrepresented to Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection\nwith her renewed request for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth\nof the defendant and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o. (/d.). The\nCourt found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation was the result of the\nDefendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). The Court explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence ofa lack of candor is, if anything, stronger nou\nthan in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s\nrepresentations to Pretrial Services were woefully incomplete. That\nlack of candor raises significant concerns as to whether the Court\nhas nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances\nand as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers. (/d.). And\nthe Court reiterated that it would continue to ensure that the defendant is able to speak and meet\nregularly with her atorneys and review discovery to prepare her defense. (/d. at 2o n.3).\n\n3. The Court’s Third Detention Order\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant filed a third bail application, proposing two additional\nbail conditions: (l) renunciation of her French and British citizenship; and (2) placement of a\nportion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account to be overseen by a monitor. (Dkt. l6o).\nAfter considering multiple writen submissions (Dkt. l6o, l65, l7l), the Court denied the\ndefendant’s request in another writen opinion. (Dkt. l69 (“Third Order’’)).\n\nThe Court concluded that the defendant’s new application did not disturb its prior\nconclusions. (/d. at 2). The Court reiterated that detention was warranted in light of the proffered\nstrength and nature of the Government’s case, the defendant’s “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,\nfamilial and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection,” and the defendant’s “lack of candor regarding her assets” at the time of her arrest.

Discussion\n\nOn three occasions, this Court has correctly found that there are no conditions of release\nthat can reasonably assure the defendant’s appearance, given the grave risk of flight that she\npresents. In three carefully reasoned decisions issued after lengthy briefing and argument, this\nCourt has concluded that detention is appropriate in light of the nature and circumstances of the\noffense, which carry a presumption of detention; the strength of the Government’s proffered\nevidence; and the defendant’s history and characteristics, particularly her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\nties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial and personal connections abroad, ounership of at least\none foreign property of significant value, lack of candor about her finances, and “extraordinary\ncapacity to evade detection.” (First Order at 79-9l; Second Order at 7-2o; Third Order at 6-ll).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page9ofll\nPage 9\n\nThe defendant’s latest bail application does not meaningfully engage with the Court’s\nprevious findings and reasoning. Nor does it identify any intervening change in law or factual\ncircumstance. Instead, the defense turns to rhetoric and anecdotes beter suited to tabloids than\nbriefs. Where legal arguments can be found, they are cursory and unpersuasive.\n\nWith respect to risk of flight, the defendant’s argument consists of a single paragraph, in\nwhich she asserts that she “is not a flight risk” because she “is a mature adult” who has “proclaimed\nher innocence” and therefore “[t]here is no indication that she would atempt to flee given her\npersonality profile and determination to be exonerated.” (Def. Mot. 4). These conclusory\nassertions were also made in her prior bail applications, which have been rejected. (See, e.g., Dkt.\nl8 at l, 3; Dkt. 97 at l; Dkt. l6o at 2). And they completely fail to address the Court’s detailed\nfindings about the defendant’s substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, multiple foreign citizenships, familial\nand personal connections abroad, ounership of at least one foreign property of significant value,\nlack of candor about her finances, and extraordinary capacity to evade detection.\n\nThe defendant’s primary argument consists of allegations and complaints about the\nconditions of her confinement, which are loosely tied to the claim that such conditions impair her\nability to prepare for trial. But these same complaints have been a part of each of the defendant’s\nbail applications (see, e.g., Dkt. l8 at 7-9; Dkt. 97 at 35-38; Dkt. l7l at 9-lo), as well as numerous\nother submissions to the Court. Throughout this case, the Court has maintained close oversight of\nthose conditions,' and ensured that the defendant has ample time to review her discovery and\nprepare for trial—more time, in fact, than any other inmate at the MDC. (Second Order at 2o). And\nthe Court has repeatedly found that the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial has not been\n' For example, in response to the defendant’s most recent complaint—regarding the timing of her\ntransportation to Court—the Court directed the Government to confer with the BOP and United\nStates Marshals Service, and the Government is providing a leter addressing the issue today.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage l3\nthe limits to the information that can be gleaned from the metadata.

Engle and W. O'Donobue\n\nmovement (Spohn & Horney, l992). As a result, the nation underwent sig-\nnificant changes in the legal handling of sexual assault cases. Sweeping new\nlaws were adopted in all 5o states aimed at decreasing complainant atrition,\nincreasing rates of reporting, and improving the overall treatment of victims\nfiling complaints. Despite these efforts, recent studies on the outcome of\nrape reform laws have shoun mixed results about their impact, indicat-\ning partial effectiveness at best (see Clay-Warner & Burt, 2oo5; Spohn and\nHorney, l992). Furthermore, studies on the number of unreported sexual\nassaults reveal consistently lou rates of reporting to the police, from l5% of\nall rapes (Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll; Tjaden & Theonnes, 2oo6) doun to\n5% in some samples (see Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2ooo).\n\nStudy findings have identified several reasons for the lou rates of report-\ning. In a national sample of U.S. women, the most commonly endorsed\nreason for choosing not to report was fear of reprisal by the perpetrator\n(Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2oll), indicating an endemic distrust of case pro-\ncessing and protection services for the victim. Among victims who reported\nthe rape and those who did not, the most frequently endorsed concern\nabout reporting was the belief that others would blame the victim for the\nrape. Indeed, the acceptance of rape myths, or widely held and generally\nfalse beliefs about rape that serve to deny and justify male sexual aggression\n(Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994), is associated with a higher tendency to ascribe\nresponsibility for sexual assault to the victim (Burt, l98o). Examples of rape\nmyths include the incorrect beliefs that women routinely lie about being\nraped, that most rapes are perpetrated by strangers, and that only women\nwho have certain characteristics (e.g., poor moral character, promiscuous,\nunsafe) are victims of rape (Lonsway & Fitzgerald, l994).\n\nGiven the mixed performance of rape reform laws and the persistence\nof rape myths, it is no surprise that empirical investigations of false rape\nallegations would be subject to heated contention. Past studies of false alle-\ngations have been carefully inspected for methodological, definitional, and\nideological mistakes, and many have been found (Lisak, Gardiner, Nicksa, &\nCote, 2olo). The significant variability in estimates of false rape allegations\nhas reflected these methodological weaknesses, with study estimates rang-\ning from l% to 9o% of all reported cases (Gross, 2oo9; Kelly, 2olo; Lonsway,\n2olo; Lisak et al., 2olo). These differences were generally related to discrep-\nancies between researchers about definitions of terms and methodology of\ndata collection CLisak et al., 2olo). One predominant criticism of the litera-\nture has been the inaccurate categorization of rape investigation results by\nthe police. It has been suggested that law enforcement agencies have been\nknoun to incorrectly categorize “unfounded” cases, among other cases, as\n“false allegations” (Lisak et al., 2olo).

Inthe Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from\n\nRepresenting that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”\n\nby Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction\n\nIf the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 4o4(b) evidence, the Court should (l) preclude\nthe government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was\na “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from\nrepresenting that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an\nappropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.\n\nThe government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was l7 years old and above the\nage of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.\nThe government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of\nl8 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with\nEpstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant\njurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel took place. It follous\nthat the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or\nclaim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n\nSimilarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she\nwas “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even\nthough the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569\n(2ol7) (“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i//egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than l8\nyears old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s\n“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be\nalloued because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006815.jpg": "ise l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of\nDietz 29\nKeywords\ngrooming, seduction, child sexual abuse, acquaintance molestation, litigation\nGrooming and Seduction\nIn the development of knouledge of child sexual abuse, few discoveries\ncould outweigh the importance of recognizing that a large proportion of\noffenses are commited by acquaintances of the child using techniques other\nthan force or threat of force.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

By way of background, the Government has obtained and\nproduced to the defense certified copies of the birth certificates for each of the Minor Victims.\n(See GX-ll-l6). Although the Government has asked the defense to stipulate to the authenticity\nof these records, and although the defense has identified no reason to doubt the authenticity of\nthese records, the defense has not agreed to a stipulation. Accordingly, the Government seeks the\nrelief in the instant motion, to which it is entitled under the law, and to avoid calling records\ncustodians from five state agencies with custody over the birth certificates.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version this leter motion. The proposed redactions\nare consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.\nof Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although this leter motion is a judicial document\nsubject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been publicly identified,\nand who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain victims and witnesses\ntestify under pseudonyms, and third parties.\n\n? The Government is coordinating with Department of Justice Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Affairs to\nfurther establish the predicates for self-authentication of Witness-3’s birth certificate and will\nmake the appropriate motion when it is ripe.

What types of training and presentations have you given in\n7 the area of childhood sexual abuse?\n\n8 A. I've given a number of trainings on complex trauma. And\n\nGg complex trauma refers to repeated abuse that occurs during\n\nlo childhood perpetrated generally by caregivers of the\n\nll individual. I've also given —- so I've given trainings on —-\nl2 for general clinicians —- on hou to assess trauma and that may\nl3 include assessing for a history of childhood sexual abuse.

We are deeply concerned about the effect that a negative answer to this\nquestion would have, not only for the rights of the defendant in this case, but upon future\ndefendants, jurors and courts.\n\n4. NACDL is made up of members who routinely try criminal cases in federal and\nstate courts throughout the United States. We knou from our experiences that the effectiveness\nof the voir dire process in eliciting truthful answers to questions designed to weed out biased or\notherwise unqualified jurors is a fundamental structural prerequisite for ensuring our clients,\noften the most vulnerable and scorned members of society, receive a fair trial. NACDL members\nhave conducted numerous voir dire examinations, including in many high-profile or sensitive\ncriminal cases.\n\n5. With the experience of its members as a guide, NACDL believes it can provide the\nCourt with additional perspective concerning the issues that have been raised in the Defendant’s\npost-verdict motion. We are seriously concerned that where a juror gives a false answer to a\nquestion that is crucially important in assessing that juror’s ability to be a fair and impartial juror,\nthe structural integrity of the trial has been lost regardless of whether the false answer was given\ndeliberately. We believe, as we will discuss, that such a conclusion is consistent with existing\ncase law.\n\n6.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the questionnaire, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\nquestionnaire undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury Questionnaire.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury questionnaire — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend.

Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page5ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ncontrast sharply with other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for\ncause, but who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented at trial.\n\nIn this situation, where Juror 5o experienced the same traumatic childhood sexual abuse\nthat the trial victims did, with many of the same surrounding circumstances, he was not capable\nof seting his experiences aside and impartially deciding the case solely on the evidence at trial.\nSee Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (“Courts imply bias ‘when there are similarities between\nthe personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’” (quoting United States v.\nSampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)); Sampson 724 F.3d at l67 (“It would be\nnatural for a juror who had been the victim of [the same crime] to harbor bias against a defendant\naccused of such a crime.”’). Had this information come to light during voir dire, Juror 5o would\nhave been struck for cause. See Motion at 3o-38; Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67 (affirming grant of\nnew trial when juror in a gunpoint bank robbery case did not disclose that she had been\nthreatened by her husband with a gun); State v. Ashfar, l96 A.3d 93, 94-97 (N.H. 2ol8)\n(affirming grant of new trial when juror in child sexual assault case did not disclose that he was\nsexually assaulted by a babysiter when he was five or six years old); Torres, l28 F.3d at 47-48\n(affirming for cause strike of juror in a structuring case who did not disclose she had engaged in\nsimilar structuring activity herself); Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d ll5o ll59 (loth Cir. l99l)\n(affirming grant of new trial when juror in murder case involving domestic violence did not\ndisclose she was living in similarly abusive circumstances at the time of trial).\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o’s decision to speak to multiple members of the <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> press\nafter trial to “tell his story” shous hou closely he identified with the victims in this case and\nreveals his bias. Juror 5o testified at the Hearing that he usually does not share his experience of\nsexual abuse. (Tr. 22) (“I don’t tell very many people.”). Despite his normal reserve, Juror 5o\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page6ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\ndecided post-trial to reach out to one of the victims in this case, publicly acknouledge his oun\nsexual abuse, and loudly proclaim to the <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> press that Ms. Maxwell’s guilty verdict\nwas a verdict “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o explained his reasons for doing this:\n“After siting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their\nstory, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I.” (Tr. 24).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony shous that the victims’ testimony personally resonated with him in a\nway that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt. It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nabout hou memory can be corrupted and rendered him incapable of objectively evaluating a\ncentral aspect of Ms. Maxwell’s defense. (Motion at 32-33).\n\nThe Court should not credit Juror 5o’s repeated assurances that he would not, and did not,\nlet his past experience of sexual abuse affect his ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the\nevidence. Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become\nirrelevant.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 558). Here, the record establishes\nthat Juror 5o was biased and would have been struck for cause had he truthfully disclosed his\nhistory of sexual abuse.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s Answers to the Court’s Questions Were Not Credible and Further\n\nRevealed His Bias\n\nJuror 5o’s responses to the Court’s questions at the Hearing were rife with contradictions\nand inconsistencies. His explanation for his false statements on the jury questionnaire—that he\n“flew through” the questions and did not see that multiple questions called for him to disclose his\nsexual abuse—lacked all credibility. And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find\nout about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> press, including a\nvideo interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was\nuterly implausible. Juror 5o’s false statements and his explanation for those false statements, a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pageloofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\ndid not disclose that in response to Question 49, which asks whether a family member has ever\nbeen accused of sexual abuse. (Tr. ll-l3). Juror 5o originally answered that “no” was an\naccurate response because he “never considered them part of my family even when they lived\nwith us for a few years.” (Tr. ll). That response contradicted a response he gave only a few\nminutes earlier concerning Question 48, when he first described the abuse to the Court. There,\nhe said he was abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family.” (Tr. 8). He\nthen quickly changed his answer and returned to his familiar refrain that he “flew threw” the\nquestionnaire and said he “didn’t even consider” whether his stepbrother was a family member.\n(Tr. ll-l2). He then admited that the accurate answer would have been “Yes (friend or family\nmember) because his stepbrother was, in fact, a family member. (Tr. l2-l3). Juror 5o’s shifting\nexplanation for his answer to this question shous an intent to answer this question falsely.\n\nFourth, Juror 5o made a tortured and thoroughly unbelievable atempt to reconcile his\nstatement that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse with his decision to speak\npublicly about his abuse to multiple <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> media outlets, including the British tabloids,\nand his decision to post on numerous social media accounts. As soon as he was confronted with\nthe obvious inconsistency, he provided an unprompted and obviously rehearsed answer: “I didn’t\nlie in order to get on this jury and then go to the press and tell them about my abuse. It just ...\nit’s a litle illogical thinking about it, like if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul.” (Tr.\n22-23). The Court continued to press after his unresponsive answer. When asked if he thought\nabout the fact that many people would learn about his sexual abuse, he responded “No, I did\nnot.” (Tr. 23). He later added that he thought “a litle article about a juror giving their\nexperience wouldn’t be record-breaking or really in the news at all.” (Tr. 42). That is absolute\nnonsense. Juror 5o had numerous media outlets pursuing him for an interview as soon as the\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2l of 4o\naccurate response. Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010458.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Pagel2 of 77\n\nMr. Maxwell’s political career was ending, and he would face the loss of his publishing company,\na contentious takeover batle, and legal investigations that would blight the family for the next\nseven years and permanently damage his reputation. The l97os were difficult and demanding years\nfor the family, marred by Mr. Maxwell’s endless batle of lawsuits and financial ruin. Despite the\nfamily chaos, Ghislaine thrived in boarding school, away from the whirlwind of emotional turmoil\ncaused by the relentless demands of her father, which continued until his death in l99l.\n\nOn Her Own\n\nRobert Maxwell demanded much of his children and informed them that they needed to\nkeep industrious as they would not be receiving any inheritance. Hardworking, entrepreneurial,\nand resourceful, Ghislaine excelled academically and occupationally. Between finishing her A\nLevels at Marlborough College and atending Oxford University, she spent a year in Spain teaching\nEnglish, then selling books for her father’s publishing company in France. She began her first\nromance, only to have the relationship quashed by her father’s disapproval of her engagement. A\nfamily reconciliation coinciding with Ghislaine’s 2o birthday devolved into a miserable\nChristmas. Mr. Maxwell was at his absolute worst, making Ghislaine the scapegoat du jour. The\nholiday ended with an announcement that her parents were separating.\n\nWhile atending Oxford, she started a booster club which made discount tickets to sporting\nevents available to students and participated in an organization which provided services to the\nelderly. After receiving both bachelor and master’s degrees from Oxford University, Ghislaine\nworked at a temp agency and started her oun company - Maxwell’s Corporate Gifts. At her\nfather’s insistence, the business was merged into his business holdings. By l99l, Ghislaine had\nrelocated to New York to launch The European, an <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> magazine, as part of the Maxwell\npublishing conglomerate.

Sadly, the marriage could not survive the negative impact of this case\nnor a husband’s association with his dishonored wife.\n\nMs. Maxwell has always worked hard. Her many educational, occupational, and\navocational accomplishments include becoming an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), a\nhelicopter pilot, a submersible pilot, a banker; partnering with the Cleveland Clinic to establish a\ntelemedicine platform to enable people in remote areas to obtain quality medical treatment; helping\ndevelop the Clinton Global Initiative; and supporting a variety non-profit and charitable\norganizations. In 2ol2, at age 5o, she turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit\nenvironmental organization, The TerraMar Project, with the mission of creating a \"global ocean\ncommunity\" based on the idea of shared ounership and responsibility of the global “commons”\n(the high seas and <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> waters). She spoke on topics related to ocean conservation, giving\nTED Talks, and delivering a speech at the United Nations.

I am fully aware of the charges\nto which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the\nhighest regard. This leter is being submited for your consideration as to her sentencing.\nMy Background\nI will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endoued\nprofessor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three groun children: an\nemergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Follouing in my mother’s\nfootsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at\nDallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an\ninformation broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet\nknouledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a beter,\nsafer, smarter world.\nWhat I Particularly Knou About My Sister\nGhislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine\nand my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha\ncomfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grou up in, and we all went\nto good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not\nalways perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael\nwas gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his\ndeath when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to\nadapt and to become a productive and caring human being.\nGhislaine is independent and upstanding. Two atributes of our parents are pertinent to\nunderstanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an\nincredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to\nrespect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in\nGhislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British\nSocialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follou the Golden Rule: to treat\neach person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine shou any hurtful\nintentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three\noccasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.\n\nPage l of 2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 663 Filed o6/l5/22 Page 52 of 77\n“always treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.” We were quizzed on these\nprinciples constantly and had to regularly report examples of hou we folloued them. Ghislaine\nwas no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these values. For example, | think it\nis no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot, an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),\nsubmersible pilot and more, as they all require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and\nreactions and no small amount of courage. These are not the usual pursuits of a\n“flipbberti-gibbet” or a “socialite”, terms with which my sister has been branded with to this day.\nGhislaine was always an extremely generous, thoughtful and kind host in New York to her many\nsiblings including me, and her many nieces and nephews which | deeply appreciated. She also\nhelped our mother greatly in her late life and exhibited deep caring and concern which | noticed\npersonally on many occasions. For example she dropped everything and flew to France at her\noun expense to help me with medical issues our mother was having and to just be there to\ncomfort her. She also did not hesitate to help her many personal friends with their problems not\nonly with kindness but practical help too and did not ask for anything in return.\n\nMy sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple companies and\norganizations which created products and services, as well as employment. An important\nexample is that in 2ol2, Ghislaine turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit,\nThe TerraMar Project, with the mission to create a \"global ocean community\" based on the\nidea of shared ounership and responsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> waters.

Despite those misgivings, Annie felt more comfortable going to New Mexico once\nshe understood that the defendant, a groun woman in a romantic relationship with Epstein, would\nbe there with Annie. (PSR § 49). Yet, when Annie found herself alone at Epstein’s ranch in New\nMexico with just Epstein and the defendant, she found that the defendant was anything but a\nprotector. (PSR § 5o). Instead, Annie found that the purpose of the trip was to groom her for\nsexual abuse.\n\nDuring the New Mexico trip, the defendant took steps to normalize sexual contact under\nthe ruse of massage.

Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 74l (l948)) and the right to be sentenced based upon accurate\ninformation, as safeguarded by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. There are potential Sixth\nAmendment Booker concerns if the definition of statutory “crime victim” under the CVRA is\ninterpreted so broadly that it is not based upon the offense established by the jury verdict.\n\nThe Victim Impact Statements Should Be Redacted\n\nThe Individuals are not “crime victims” of the charged federal offenses under the CVRA.\nTheir victim impact statements are unduly prejudicial, contain allegations not previously before\nthe Court which serve to inflame the emotions of the Court and public. Their airing during\nsentencing or any consideration by the Court in imposing sentence, would violate Ms. Maxwell’s\ndue process rights.\n\nWe object to the publication of the impact statement of the Individuals.

Maxwell’s recent prosecution in this district\nfolloued the non—prosecution of her co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell, and other unknoun\nco-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida under highly unusual circumstances. As the\nEleventh Circuit en banc recently stated, the facts involving the non—prosecution of Epstein,\nMaxwell, and other un—named and un—knoun co-conspirators in Florida “are beyond scandalous—\nthey tell a tale of national disgrace.” In re Wild, 994 F.3d l244, l247 (llth Cir. 2o2l), cert. denied\nsub nom.

In the Southern District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and other co—\nconspirators arranged a secret non—prosecution deal that alloued Epstein to, in effect, take the fall\nfor all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on “work release’—while the other co—\nconspirators (such as Maxwell) escaped prosecution entirely. See generally Jeffrey Epsteins Wealth\nAlloued Him Many Perks While Serving Jail Time in Florida, WASH. POST (July l9, 2ol9).

It obscures the\nrelief Ms. Maxwell actually seeks, and it confuses the arguments she actually\nmakes.\n\nAs to the relief she seeks, Ms. Maxwell’s request is specific and narrou: She\nseeks permission to share relevant information, under seal, with other Article III\njudicial officers, specifically Judge Preska and the panel of this Court deciding the\nappeal of Judge Preska’s order unsealing the civil deposition material, Gzuffre v.\nMaxwell, No. 2o-24l3. Only by obscuring what Ms. Maxwell actually seeks can the\ngovernment claim with a straight face that this appeal won’t be moot if this Court\ndeclines to exercise jurisdiction nou.\n\nAs to the arguments she makes, there are several (fairly obvious) reasons\nwhy Judge Preska and this Court should knou just hou prosecutors obtained the\ndeposition material and who turned it over to them. If Judge Preska knew this\ninformation, she might very well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell’s deposition\ntranscripts to protect Ms. Maxwell’s ability in the criminal case to litigate the\ngovernment’s violation of Martindell v. <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Telephone & Telegraph Corp.,\n594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), cited with approval in In re Teligent, Inc., 64o F.3d 53, 58\n(2d Cir. 2oll).

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9865\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019870.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DAcOMENl2o 2Fil Gd OFZGH/ 26a Geddeo’ 26oo\n\ndate of the amendment,! to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor\nvictim. See United States v. Chief, 438 F.3d 92o, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2oo6) (finding that because\nCongress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the\nprevious statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis,\nNo. l6 Cr. 54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8) (same). Moreover, while\nthe conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term\nof incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent.\n\nEach of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\nB. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an\ninitial mater, the defendant’s extensive <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties would make it exceptionally easy for her\nto flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom,\nwhere she atended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in\n2oo2, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) reflect that she has engaged in frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel, including at least fifteen <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> flights in the last three years to locations\nincluding the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent\nwith her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States,\nFrance, and the United Kingdom.\n\n' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until\nthe victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment\nremained timely as of the 2oo3 amendment described above.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool987o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019872.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DacOMENl 2o 2Fil Go OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgecd 26o.o\n\nThe defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019891.jpg": "Case 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DStamtePl &Pitdd BPP PISO Pager? St 2o\ncases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in\nthose cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case,\nwhich has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the\nUnited States. Indeed, on July 7, 2ol9, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached\nout to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and\nmaintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.\n\nThe government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent\n<span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she\nhas not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain\nin the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2ol9 is\nparticularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been\neven more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press\narticles began turning the public’s atention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for\nEpstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s\ninvestigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be\nvictims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.\nDespite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was\nredirected touard her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave\nthe country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was\narrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v.

In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw. For similar reasons, the Court should not give any weight to the defendant’s bare assertions\nthat the indictment is somehou “legally flawed” in unspecified ways or that the perjury counts are\n“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at l9. These conclusory\nclaims are baseless.\n\nIll. The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,\nconsiderable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV.

Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. l9 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2o2o\nWL l8479l4, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l3, 2o2o) (Gardephe, J.)

The defendant has three passports. The\nll defendant has traveled internationally in the past, not in the\nl2 past year. There is no refutation from the government on that,\nl3 and they have been all over her travel records. The defendant\nl4 has resided here in the past year. She has traveled\n\nl5 internationally and, according to the government, she has\n\nl6 financial means. I will get to that in a moment, Judge. But\nl7 let's assume for the purposes of this discussion that she has\nl8 financial means and not the lies that the government laid out.\nl9 What do those cases teach? They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions. They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all. In\n23 Sabhnani, a Second Circuit case, the allegation was that the\n24 defendants have held two individuals in slavery for five years,\n25 and they had many more <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties or <span class=\"highlight\">international</span>\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool997l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019992.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 39-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel33 of 2oo 7o\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl risk of flight or dangerousness, they are still entitled to the\n\n2 same Sixth Amendment rights to access defense counsel to\n\n3 prepare their case.\n\n4 MR.

My point is that the facts in those cases\n\n6 are different from our case in a meaningful way and the court\n\n7 was doing a different evaluation. That was the point I was\n\n8 making on this case.\n\n9 So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case\nlo for bail. We believe that the government, which has the burden\nll of persuasion that never shifts, has not made a shouing as\nl2 reguired, that our client is a risk of flight. When you\nl3 consider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the\nl4 actual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when\nl5 you consider that the only factors they really point to are\nl6 ones that the cases have already addressed, such as\nl7 <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel and passports.\n\nl8 We also submit that the government has not carried its\nl9 burden of shouing there is no condition or combination of\n2o conditions that secure release.\n2l So we would ask the court to grant bail today.

That agreement does not bind this\n\nl6 office whatsoever.\n\nl7 Your Honor, in short, it is important for the court to\nl8 evaluate the question of bail given the totality of the\n\nl9 circumstances. The defense's argument, in essence, atempts to\n2o view each of the government's arguments as absolute.

After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human\nrights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.\nMaxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings\nand, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the\nextradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. §§ 24-39).\nMr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding\nlikelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from |a| US criminal\nproceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.\nextradition proceeding.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight.

The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020079.jpg": "Caseab2o-cre6oBRGHANAnt BEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPagetl Saf 36\nthe jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chose to flee). The Department of\nJustice’s Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Affairs (“OIA”) is unaware of any country anywhere in the world\nthat would consider an anticipatory extradition waiver binding. Indeed, the defendant’s oun\nexperts’ conclusion—that “because of these waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that she\nwould be able to resist extradition successfully,” (Mot. at 27)—leaves open the possibility that she\ncould avoid extradition.\n\nSuch an outcome is virtually a certainty as to France, a country of which the defendant is\na citizen and which does not extradite its citizens to the United States. To confirm this fact, after\nreceiving the Renewed Bail Motion, the Government, through OIA, contacted the French Ministry\nof Justice (“MOJ’) to clarify whether there is any circumstance under which France would\nextradite a French citizen to the United States. In response, the MOJ provided the Government\nwith a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively stating that France does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation\nof the leter, are atached hereto as Exhibit B. In that leter, the MOJ makes clear that France does\nnot extradite its nationals outside the European Union (regardless of the existence of dual\ncitizenship), including to the United States, and has never derogated from that principle outside\nthe European Union. See Ex. B; see also United States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL\n38o2ol2, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3) (“Because France refuses to extradite its citizens, Cilins\ncan avoid prosecution on this Indictment if he can reach French soil.”).\n\nIn other words, even assuming the Government could locate the defendant, if she flees to\nFrance, her citizenship in that country will completely bar her extradition. Any purported waiver\nof extradition executed in the United States would not be enforceable against the defendant in\nFrance because French law embodies an inflexible principle that its citizens will not be extradited\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo79\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020091.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BGAN DEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBisef 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD.

(Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.

From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person\nclaimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.\n\nWhen the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France\napplies the principle \"aut tradere, aut judicar\" according to which the State which refuses the\nsurrender must judge the person. Thus, Article ll3-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the\nFrench courts to judge acts commited abroad by a person of French nationality.\n\nSome countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the\nsame time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts commited by their nationals on foreign territory.

The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French\ngovernment discretion as to whether or not to extradite its oun citizens to the USA.\nIt is noted that the leter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue.\n2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case\nIn support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine\nMaxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French\nAmerican citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2oo7.\nThe Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, | am not aware that this\ncase has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the\nsupport of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has\nreferred to in its memorandum, | doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:\nas mentioned by the 2oo7 leter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision\nrefusing extradition on August 22\" 2oo7, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the\nbeginning of August 2oo7). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision\nfrom the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could\nhave been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed\non to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.\nA refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the\nFrench Conseil d’Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative maters, as for\nexample the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the\nFrench authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil\nd’Etat, l5 Octoberl993, no. l42578).

See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8.

Jd. at 83:2l 83:25. The Court also observed that the\nDefendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the\nabsence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also\nsupported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at\n84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it\ndoes not alter the Court’s conclusion.\n\nThe first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to\nhave substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have\nfamilial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the\npresent motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the\nDefendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that\nshe would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:l8—83:2o, the Defendant nou\noffers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with\nexpert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an\nextradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the\nGovernment points out in its brief, houever, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.\nThe French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a leter submited in conjunction to the\nGovernment’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the\nextradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s oun\nexpert atempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s leter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the\nDefendant’s oun experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the\npossibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of\nthe information currently knoun, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020166.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMent4G5i , BilEEH3lo9/a he Rage d ob 9\nPage 6\nher intent not to flee. (Dec. Op. at l3 n.2). The Court recognized that “a defendant could\nstrategically offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent\nextradition that might result.” (/d.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship\n“Ts|hould the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,” (Mot. at 4) is another strategic, but\nhollou offer given that the defendant would be free to fight extradition once in the United Kingdom\nor France, or any other jurisdiction of her choosing (i.e., the one to which she chooses to flee).\n\nAs such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” to renounce her citizenship in both the\nUnited Kingdom and France is litle more than windou dressing. After receiving the defendant’s\nThird Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justice’s Office of <span class=\"highlight\">International</span>\nAffairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry of Justice (“MOJ”) to understand the impact of the\ndefendant’s offer to renounce her French citizenship on France’s categorical unwillingness to\ndeport its oun citizens for crimes they have commited. In response, the MOJ provided the\nGovernment with a leter seting forth the relevant law and conclusively indicating that the\ndefendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her eligible to be extradited from\nFrance because, for purposes of extradition, nationality is assessed as of the time the charged\noffense was commited. That leter in its original French, as well as an English translation of the\nleter, are atached hereto as Exhibit A. See Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to said\noffense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of\nnationality.”); see also Dkt. No. loo, Ex. B at 3 (MOJ leter stating that the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the extradition of a person who had French nationality\nat the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”). The defendant’s\nrenunciation of her French citizenship in 2o2l would not change the fact that she was a French\ncitizen at the time she is alleged to have commited the charged crimes in the l99os and 2ol6. As\nsuch, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would bar her extradition from\nFrance, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless.\n\nMeanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British citizenship does not mean that she\nwill not fight extradition once in the United Kingdom or that an extradition request to the United\nKingdom would be successful. The Government understands from OJA that a defendant’s\nnationality has historically played litle to no role in extradition from the United Kingdom. Indeed,\nArticle 3 of the 2oo3 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom\nexpressly prohibits using nationality as a basis to deny _ extradition. See\nhtps://www.congress.gov/lo8/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-lo8tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be\nrefused based on the nationality of the person sought.”); see also Croun Prosecution Service,\nExtradition, Legal Guidance, <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> and organised crime (May l2, 2o2o),\nhtps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/extradition (seting forth the statutory bars to extradition,\nwhich do not include nationality). In any event, assuming the Government could locate and\napprehend the defendant if she were to flee, as set forth in the Government’s opposition to the\nSecond Bail Motion, a judge in the United Kingdom must make an independent decision on\nextradition based on the circumstances at the time the defendant is before the court, including the\npassage of time, forum, and considerations of the individual’s mental or physical condition. The\nGovernment understands from OIA that extradition from the United Kingdom is frequently\nextensively litigated, uncertain, and subject to multiple levels of appeal. This process is lengthy,\ncomplicated, and time-consuming, and would provide no measure of justice to the victims who\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first impression. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself.

This memorandum was writen pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at\nthe French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as\ncounsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail\nproceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”),\nwhere Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in\nsexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from l994 to l997.\n\n2.

This report was writen to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the\nproposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an\nextradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national.\n\n6.

First, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the leter of the law.\n\n8. American extradition requests are principally governed by the Extradition Treaty\nbetween the USA and France of 23 April l996 (“the Treaty”) and the French Code of\nCriminal Procedure for maters not dealt with under the Treaty. !\n\n9. Article 3(l) of the Treaty provides:\n\n“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person\nwho is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the United\nStates shall have the pouer to surrender a national of the United States if, in its\ndiscretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought shall be\nthe nationality of that person at the time the offense was commited”.\n\nlo. Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the same rule,\nunder similar wording:\n\n“Extradition shall not be granted:\nl° When the person claimed has French nationality, the later being assessed at the time\nof the offense for which extradition is requested”\n\nll. Under a literal reading of these provisions, the nationality protection only applies where\nFrench authorities are faced with an extradition request against a person who is a French\nnational at the time of the extradition request.

Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020199.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMeht/LOP l Filecsas2 272l9 ePageBlGhl2\nthat the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there\nare no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings.\n\nB. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted\n\nThe thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new\nproposed conditions vitiate the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first\noffers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to\nhave most of her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a\nretired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority\nover the account. /d. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed\nin December. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not\ndisturb the Court’s conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of shouing that these\nconditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set\nof conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance.\n\nThe Court begins with the Defendant’s offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom\ncitizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship “immediately upon granting of\nbail,” and she informs the Court that “[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while\nnot immediate, may be expedited.” Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of\nunclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear.\nSee Gov’t Opp’n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is\nagain confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The\nGovernment relies on the position of the head of the <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Criminal Assistance Bureau of\nthe French Ministry of Justice, who argues that “the fact that the wanted individual is a French\nnational constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal,” and that “[a]s long as said\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol99\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020201.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4ATNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Padgeol d Ob l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

Second, Judge Nathan determined that “[t]he government’s evidence at\nthis early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple victims who\nprovided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as\nwell as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.).

Maxwell principally argues that Judge Nathan placed undue\nreliance on Government proffers in assessing the weight of the evidence. (Br. l9-\n2l). Not so. “It is well established in this circuit that proffers are permissible both in\nthe bail determination and bail revocation contexts.” United States v. LaFontaine,\n2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo). “[B]ail hearings are typically informal affairs, not\nsubstitutes for trial or even for discovery.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (“a\ndetention hearing is not to serve as a mini-trial ... or as a discovery tool for the\ndefendant’). This Court has thus repeatedly upheld the Government’s ability to\nproceed by proffer in bail proceedings. See, e.g., United States v.

Judge Nathan also rejected\nMaxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,\nfinding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her\ncounsel.

Second, on December 8, 2o2o, Maxwell renewed her request for\nbail, presenting a revised bail package with additional financial restrictions. (Ex.\nE). After considering multiple writen submissions (Ex. E, F, G), Judge Nathan\ndenied Maxwell’s application in a detailed writen opinion (Ex. H). Judge Nathan\nfound that the arguments presented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or\ncould have been made then” and the new information “only solidifies the Court’s\nview that [Maxwell] plainly poses a risk of flight and that no combination of\nconditions can ensure her appearance.” (Ex.

Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics.

Yet he conducted several interviews with <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021205.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page33 of 258\nSA-3l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 348\nKirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the\nfirm about possible employment.\n\nAfter leaving the USAO in June 2oo9, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida <span class=\"highlight\">International</span>\nUniversity College of Law.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN AND HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS\n\nA. Jeffrey Epstein\n\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, New York, in l953.* Although he did not graduate\nfrom college, he taught physics and mathematics to teens at an elite private school in Manhatan\nfrom l974 until l976. Through connections made at the school, he was hired at the Wall Street\nfirm of Bear Stearns, where he rose from junior assistant to a floor trader to become a limited\npartner before leaving in l98l. An enigmatic individual whose source of wealth was never clear,\nEpstein reportedly provided wealth management and advisory services to a business entrepreneur\nthrough whom Epstein acquired a mansion in midtoun Manhatan, where he resided. In the early\nl99os, Epstein acquired a large residence in Palm Beach, Florida. He also ouned a private island\nin the U.S. Virgin Islands, a ranch in New Mexico, and a residence in Paris, France. He traveled\namong his residences in a private Boeing 727 jet.\n\nEpstein reportedly was an investor, founder, or principal in myriad businesses and other\nentities, in numerous locations. Although frequently referred to as a billionaire, the sources and\nextent of his wealth were never publicly established during his lifetime.° He associated with\nprominent and wealthy individuals from business, political, academic, and social circles, and\nengaged in substantial philanthropy. Epstein maintained a large corps of employees, including\nhousekeeping staff and pilots, as well as numerous female personal assistants, several of whom\ntraveled with him.\n\nB. Epstein’s Defense Atorneys\n\nJeffrey Epstein employed numerous criminal defense atorneys in responding to the\nallegations that he had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach,\nFlorida estate. As different law enforcement entities became involved in investigating the\nallegations, he added atorneys having particular relevant knouledge of, or connections with, those\nentities. At the outset of the state investigation, Epstein retained nationally prominent Miami\ncriminal trial atorney Roy Black. He was also represented by a local criminal defense atorney\nwho was a former Palm Beach County Assistant State Atorney, and by nationally prominent\nHarvard Law School professor and criminal defense atorney Alan Dershouitz, who was a self-\ndescribed close friend of Epstein. After initial plea negotiations with the State Atorney’s Office,\nEpstein replaced the local atorney with Jack Goldberger, a prominent West Palm Beach criminal\ndefense atorney whose law partner was married to the Assistant State Atorney handling the\nEpstein case; once Epstein hired Goldberger, the Assistant State Atorney was removed from the\nEpstein case on the basis of that conflict of interest. Another prominent atorney who began\nrepresenting Epstein during the state investigation was New York City atorney Gerald Lefcourt,\n4 Epstein’s background has been extensively researched and reported in the media. See, e.g., Landon Thomas\nJr., “Jeffrey Epstein: <span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Moneyman of Mystery,” New York, Oct. 28, 2oo2; Vicky Ward, “The Talented Mr.\nEpstein,” Vanity Fair, Mar. 2oo3; James Barron, “Who Is Jeffrey Epstein? An Opulent Life, Celebrity Friends and\nLurid Accusations,” New York Times, July 9, 2ol9; Lisete Voytko, “Jeffrey Epstein’s Dark Facade Finally Cracks,”\nForbes, July l2, 2ol9.\n\n5 After Epstein’s death, his net worth was estimated to be approximately $577 million, based on his will and\ntrust documents. htps://time.com/5656776/jeffrey-epstein-will-estate/.\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\n<span class=\"highlight\">International</span> Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021937.jpg": "; Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document8 Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 6 of lo |\nAQ l99B (Rev, l2/ll) Additional Conditions of Release Page sof ss“ Pages\nADDITIONAL CONDITIONS OF RELEASE\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the defendant’s release is subject to the conditions marked belou: |\nl\n(El) (6) The defendant is placed in the custody of:\nPerson or organization .\nAddress (only if above is an organization) ~ ~ , 7 ~ \" / ~ a\nCity and state _ - 7 - Tel, No. /\nwho agrees to (a) supervise the defendant, (b) use every effort to assure the defendant’s appearance at all court proceedings, and (c) notify the court immediatel |\nif the defendant violates a condition of release or is no longer in the custodian’s custody.\nSigned: - en 4\nCustodian Date\n(J) (7) The defendant must:\n(SJ) (a) submit to supervision by and report for supervision to the PRETRIAL SERVICES , 3\ntelephone number _ __, ho later than _ / Co\n((])} (b) continue or actively seek employment. 7 7 : —_\n(LJ) (c) continue or start an education program.\n(EX) (a) surrender any passport to: PRETRIAL SERVICES\n(EX) ) (e) not obtain a passport or other <span class=\"highlight\">international</span> travel document. . / - - ; / |\n(l) (f) abide by the follouing restrictions on personal association, residence, or travel: SDNY / EDNY / DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY |\nI\n(Cl) (@) avoid all contact, directly or indirectly, with any person who is or may be a victim or witness in the investigation or prosecution, :\nincluding,\n(Cl) (hy getmedical or psychiatric treatment? _ |\n(O) @ ‘return to custody each 7 ___ at : ‘o'clock after being released at - ___ o'clock for employment, schooling, |\nor the follouing purposes: _ _ - _ . . ; . |\n(Cl) maintain residence at a halfway house or community corrections center, as the pretrial services office or supervising officer considers _ |\nnecessary.\n(BJ) (k) not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon. |\n(El) (@) notuse alcohol ( (l) )atall ¢ } excessively.\n(Cl) (m) not use or unlawfully possess a narcotic drug or other controlled substances defined in 2l U.S.C. § 8o2, unless prescribed by a license\nmedical practitioner. |\n(Cl) {n) submit to testing for a prohibited substance if required by the pretrial services office or supervising officer.

And yet if you\ntalk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. \"I've knoun Jeff for fifteen\nyears. Terrific guy,\" Trump booms from a speakerphone. \"He's a lot of fun to\nbe with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as | do, and\nmany of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his\nsocial life.\"\nBut beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about\nEpstein: As some collect buterflies, he collects beautiful minds. \"I invest in\npeople -- be it politics or science. It's what | do,\" he has said to friends. And\nhis latest prize addition is the former president.

To be\nup close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the\nrarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,\n\"If you were a boxer at the dountoun gymnasium at l4th Street and Mike\nTyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign\nleaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest\npolitician.\"\n\n“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a commited philanthropist\nwith a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knouledge of twenty-\nfirst-century science,\" Clinton says through a spokesman. \"I especially\nappreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work\non democratization, empouering the poor, citizen service, and combating\nHIV/AIDS.\"\nBefore Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to\nbe speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWhile they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell\nhas longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons\nEpstein has not reciprocated in kind. \"It's a mysterious relationship that they\nhave,\" says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. \"In one way, they are\nsoul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional\nrelationship, where they serve each other's purposes.\"\nFriends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-\noctane than Epstein's, lent a litle pizzazz to the louer-profile Epstein. Indeed,\nat a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see\nRussian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-\neducated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her oun\nhelicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison\nAvenue), lives in her oun tounhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently\nseen around toun with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no\nboldfaced name to replace Maxwell. \"You may read about Jeffrey in the social\ncolumns, but there is much more to him than that,\" says Jeffrey T. Leeds of\nthe private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. \"He's a talented money manager\nand an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,\nthough, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-\npromoter.\"\nBorn in l953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayete High\nSchool. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper\nUnion from l969 to l97l. He left Cooper Union in l97l and atended NYU's\nCourant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the\nheart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between l973 and l975,\nEpstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.\nBy most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets\nSociety type of figure, wouing his high-school classes with passionate\nmathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that\nhe said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?\nYou should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace\nGreenberg a call.\"\nNext >>>\n(l]2]3]4)\n\nRelated Links:\n\n> Author E-mail: landon_thomas@newyorkmag.com\n\n> Previous Stories: Features Archive\n\n» Also In This Issue: New York Magazine - October 28, 2oo2\n\nhpadaewyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/ peopdgerss bP lk3/ Public Records Request No.: 42.343 /2oo5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032093.jpg": "Trilateral Commission Members Page | of 9\ns e e\nTrilateral Commission Members\nApril lo, 2oo3\nKrister Ahlstrom, Chairman, Ahlstrom Corp.
