United States, o8 Civ. 8o736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.\n36l at 3-4, 36l-7 through 36l-ll. In addition to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d), prosecutors also proposed\nthat the defendant could plead guilty to l8 U.S.C. § 4o3, that is, a knouing or <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> violation\nof the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-\ncounsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 36l-ll. They also discussed\na possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private\ninvestigators folloued [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 36l-lo.\n\nThe defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or\ntamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an\nindividual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s\nconsideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even\nbeing charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s\ncase here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed\nabove, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.\n\nFinally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage\nvictim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking\nwomen or girls in his Manhatan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of\nhis arrest, on July 6-7, 2ol9, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers\ndiscovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the\nmansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at\nleast hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-\nnude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some\nof the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl\nwho, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.\nAdditionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which\nlaw enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-writen labels including the\nfollouing: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a\nregistered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a\ncontinuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting\ndeeply serious charges.\n> The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.\n® See, e. g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator,\nN.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an “offender,” the financier told The Post\nyesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.’”); Philip\nWeiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus story, someone who flies too\nclose to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000954.jpg": "Case l24 O/CRODBROHAGN 2OdtUMENt/2o FilecOOAG2o2 P ahage of Gfooo\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice.

Under well-established principles of general contract law,\nand particularly under the law relating to non-prosecution agreements, any and all of Epstein’s\npotential co-conspirators are third-party beneficiaries of the NPA. As federal courts have\nrepeatedly recognized in enforcing third-party immunity provisions, a third-party beneficiary\nneed not be expressly named in an immunity provision as long as she falls within the class of\npersons on whom the parties intended to confer immunity. Because the indictment alleges that\nMs. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, she falls well within the protection provided by\nthe NPA.\n\nSecond, the government claims that the co-conspirator immunity provision applies only\nto prosecutions in the SDFL. But the NPA was a highly negotiated, non-standard agreement. It\nis not the standard agreement the government wishes it to be. The plain language of the NPA\nsquarely refutes the government’s position. The co-conspirator immunity provision does not\nprohibit merely prosecutions by the USAO for the SDFL (“USAO-SDFL”), but by “the United\nStates.” This broad prohibition was <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>, as demonstrated by the express references\nelsewhere in the NPA to the United States Atorney and/or the USAO-SDFL. Indeed, compare\nthe NPA’s immunity provision for Epstein himself, which is expressly limited to prosecutions in\nthe SDFL, and the co-conspirator immunity provision, which contains no such limitation. Even\nif the language were ambiguous as to its impact on prosecutions on the SDFL, which it is not,\nany ambiguity must be construed against the government.\n\nIn opposition, the government relies on the Second Circuit’s statement that “[a] plea\nagreement binds only the office of the United States Atorney for the district in which the plea is\nentered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l42 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 32 of 38\nAtorney’s Office.” NPA at 2.

It\nprovides, simply, that the United States will not “institute any criminal charges against any\npotential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Jd. at 5 (emphasis added). The provision could not be\nclearer, either on its face or in the context of the NPA as a whole. As with the absence of\nlanguage limiting the provision to prosecution in the SDFL, the absence of any language limiting\nthe offenses for which potential co-conspirators cannot be prosecuted, when such language is\nincluded as to Epstein, must be presumed under contract interpretation principles to have been\n<span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank, 424 F.3d at 2o6; Port Consol., 826 F. App’x at 827-28.

The charges against Ms. Maxwell\ninvolve her alleged role as a co-conspirator of Epstein, involving alleged conduct almost\nidentical to the alleged conduct that led up to the NPA. Indeed, the United States Atorney for\nthis District, in announcing the current indictment, described it as “the prequel to the earlier case\nwe brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquete, J., Winter, T., and\nFitzpatrick, S. “Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges.”\nNBC New York.

Counts\nOne through Four charge Ms. Maxwell with offenses allegedly commited between l994 and\nl997. But the applicable statute of limitations, l8 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the\nalleged conduct.\n\nIn an atempt to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2oo3—many years after the alleged conduct\noccurred. But the government’s reliance on that provision is improper for two separate and\nindependent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal of Counts One through Four.\n\nFirst, the charges are time-barred even under § 3283 unless the Court retroactively\napplies the 2oo3 amendment to the statute to cover Ms. Maxwell’s conduct from the l99os,\nrather than the version of § 3283 that was in effect at the time of the alleged offenses. But\nCongress made surpassingly clear that it did not intend the 2oo3 amendment to apply\nretroactively.

Moreover, any\nsuch retroactive application would have a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.\n\nSecond, even if the 2oo3 amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not\napply to any of the offenses alleged in the indictment at all. Section 3283 is an exception to the\ngeneral five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or\nphysical abuse or kidnapping of a child.

Indeed, Landgraf\nitself included a legislative history analysis. 5ll U.S. at 264. In Landgraf, houever, the Court\nconcluded that the legislative history at issue did not clearly evidence Congress’ intent regarding\nretroactivity. Jd.

That period of time—\nand, in particular, less than one year between when key victims came forward and the Indictment\nwas obtained—cannot possibly give rise to a colorable due process violation.” See Cheung Kin\nPing, 555 F.2d at lo72 (finding that “the government is not responsible for a period of delay during\nwhich an important witness is unavailable to it” and describing the delay as the period between the\nwitness’s cooperation and the date of indictment); United States v.

As noted above, two\nkey witnesses who helped give rise to the instant charges did not agree to speak law enforcement\nuntil 2ol9, facts that significantly undercut the notion that the Government was intentionally\nsiting on a criminal case against the defendant for any meaningful period of time.

If\nCongress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could\neasily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent\nthat the 2oo3 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear\nintent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the\nconcerns Senator Leahy articulated.”\n\nThe government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the\n2oo3 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,\nto extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse\nvictims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 3l. But statutory\namendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a\ndecision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the\neffectuation of that purpose.

See Opp. 3l n.l4 (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was\nno indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it\nultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply\nprescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2oo3 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series\nof different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed\nscheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear\nreflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party\nargued otherwise.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo366l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l5 of 349\nAtorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained.

Precedent requires courts\nto adhere to the standards governing analogous Fourth Amendment claims when asked to\nsuppress evidence under their inherent authority. See Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol-o2.\n\nThe Supreme Court has set out a clear standard governing when a misrepresentation to a\nmagistrate in a warrant affidavit justifies suppression of evidence obtained as a result. See\nFranks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. l54 (l978). That standard requires more than an inadvertent\nmisstatement. “To suppress evidence obtained pursuant to an affidavit containing erroneous\ninformation, the defendant must shou that: (l) the claimed inaccuracies or omissions are the\nresult of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth; and (2) the alleged\nfalsehoods or omissions were necessary to the issuing judge’s probable cause finding.” United\nStates v. Canfield, 2l2 F.3d 7l3, 7l7-l8 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Franks forecloses the argument that all misstatements to a court—even all <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>\nmisstatements—necessarily require suppression. A defendant cannot circumvent this standard\nby couching the same arguments in due process or the court’s inherent authority instead. See\nPayner, 447 U.S. at 736.\n\nFranks also defines the standard governing when a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary\nhearing on a motion to suppress based on the Government’s misrepresentation to a court.

They may enjoy the large amounts\n\nof atention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”\n\nrole that can be played out in other relationships. In times when atention\n\nis not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault\n\nmay help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their\ndepressed state.\n\nThe misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-\nally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue\nnonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a\nperson who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing\nand accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as\n<span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead\nher to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into\nher, it was an <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to\nfalse allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-\nnosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of atention and\nmisinterpretation may knouingly or unknouingly make a false allegation of\nsexual assault.\n\nDelirium\n\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo,\np. l36), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied\nby a change in cognition that cannot be beter accounted for by a preex-\nisting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual\ndisturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or\neven hallucinations.\n\nDelirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-\ndrawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,\n2ooo). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality\nand thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-\ning false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual\nwith delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family\nmembers, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers\nmay be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could\nbe construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.\nPsychotic Disorders\nThe term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-\nsions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo). Psychotic\ndisorders include the follouing: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page8oflil\nHoldings, Inc., No. l6-CV-2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

Dr.\nRocchio’s first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding hou a minor may be\nenticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions\nmay also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with\nJeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s fourth\nopinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> enticement or\ninducement.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on\nanticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if\nthe Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion\nmay become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in\nfully disclosing sexual abuse.

As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to the government’s leter of this morning requesting a hearing to\nconsider a Juror’s statements to various media sources that the Juror was a victim of sexual\nassault. Doc. 568. The government’s request for a hearing is premature because based on\nundisputed, publicly available information, the Court can and should order a new trial without\nany evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that to be entitled to a new trial, “a party must first\ndemonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then\nfurther shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). This standard applies\neven if the juror’s conduct was merely inadvertent and not <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>. United States v.

We are deeply concerned about the effect that a negative answer to this\nquestion would have, not only for the rights of the defendant in this case, but upon future\ndefendants, jurors and courts.\n\n4. NACDL is made up of members who routinely try criminal cases in federal and\nstate courts throughout the United States. We knou from our experiences that the effectiveness\nof the voir dire process in eliciting truthful answers to questions designed to weed out biased or\notherwise unqualified jurors is a fundamental structural prerequisite for ensuring our clients,\noften the most vulnerable and scorned members of society, receive a fair trial. NACDL members\nhave conducted numerous voir dire examinations, including in many high-profile or sensitive\ncriminal cases.\n\n5. With the experience of its members as a guide, NACDL believes it can provide the\nCourt with additional perspective concerning the issues that have been raised in the Defendant’s\npost-verdict motion. We are seriously concerned that where a juror gives a false answer to a\nquestion that is crucially important in assessing that juror’s ability to be a fair and impartial juror,\nthe structural integrity of the trial has been lost regardless of whether the false answer was given\ndeliberately. We believe, as we will discuss, that such a conclusion is consistent with existing\ncase law.\n\n6. While a finding that the misstatement was <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> would make it even more\ncertain that such a juror had an agenda and/or was biased, it should not be required where, as\nZz\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009032.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 3l of 66\ninvidious as an intentionally false answer. United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d\nCir. l993).'! As the Second Circuit held in Langford:\n\nWe read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\n\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,\n\nfor though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before\n\nit, lt stated that the further shouing of cause must be made even after a juror’s\n\n“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various\n\n“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan\n\nsimilarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even lf the\n\njuror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the\n\nproper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this\nsituation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting\nprejudice to the litigant. . .\n... Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer\nwas inadvertent or <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>, are simply factors to be\nconsidered in th[e] . . . determination of actual bias.\n\nLangford, 99o F.2d at 68 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment)).\n\nThe seminal case addressing a juror’s false answers during voir dire ls\nMcDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood. McDonough was a products liability\naction in which Juror Payton remained silent when the district court asked, “hou many of\nyou [potential jurors] have yourself or any members of your immediate family sustained\nany severe injury [in] an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that result in any\ndisability or prolonged pain and suffering?” 464 U.S. at 55o.

United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. l, ll\n(l933). “[A] juror who lies [his] way onto a jury is not really a juror at all; [he is an\ninterloper akin ‘to a stranger who sneaks into the jury room.’” Daugerdas, 867 F.

No. 3l7 at lo; see\nalso Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7). The defendant did not previously make any shouing of an <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>\nand deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose. She fails to address the\nCourt’s prior findings and has made no additional shouing.\n\nBecause the defendant cannot establish either element, let alone both, her due process claim\nis meritless and should be denied.\nA. The Defendant Has Failed to Demonstrate Actual and Substantial Prejudice\nl. Applicable Law\nIt is well-setled that the statute of limitations is “the primary guarantee against bringing\noverly stale criminal charges.” United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 322 (l97l). Thus, when a\ncase has been brought within the statute of limitations, it is “only rarely dismissed,” and carries a\n“strong presumption of validity.” United States v. Cornielle, l7l F.3d 748, 752 (2d Cir. l999);\nsee also United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 694 (2d Cir. l982).°\n8 As this Court previously found, the “applicable statute of limitations” does not “bar[] the charges\nhere.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l8).\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9597\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 45of5l\nB. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish that the Government Delayed the Indictment\nfor an Improper Purpose\n3. Applicable Law\n\nIf, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry\nturn to the reason for the delay. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (“Because\nDefendant failed to shou prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong[.]”’). The\nreason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental\nnotions of “fair play.” United States v. Lovasco, 43l U.S. 783, 795 (l977). The Supreme Court\nhas “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrouly,”\nDouling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (l99o), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the\nimportance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when\nthe claim is based on loss of evidence atributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,\n488 U.S. 5l, 57 (l988).\n\nThe Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment\nfiled within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,\ndeliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical\nadvantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (delay must be an “<span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>\ndevice to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused” (quoting Marion, 4o4 U.S. at 324)); see\nalso United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3) (“To shou unjustifiable conduct,\na defendant must demonstrate that the government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair\ntactical advantage.”); United States v. Delacruz, 97o F. Supp. 2d l99, 2o3 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“[The\ndefendant’s] motion to dismiss would nevertheless fail for the independent reason that he has not\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 46 of5l\nmade any shouing that the preindictment delay was an <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> device designed by the\nGovernment to gain a tactical advantage.”); United States v. Martinez, No. 94 Cr. 2l9 (RPP), l995\nWL lo849, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l2, l995) (“In order to establish improper delay by the\nGovernment in filing an indictment, a defendant must shou that the delay was the result of an\n<span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> device of the Government to gain tactical advantage over the accused.” (citing United\nStates v. Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 67l (2d Cir. l987))). Indeed, some version of the phrase “deliberate\ndevice” and “tactical advantage” is found in nearly every Second Circuit decision on the issue.\nSee, e.g., Alameh, 34l F.3d at l76 (“intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical advantage”);\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752 (requiring “<span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> device” to gain “tactical advantage”); Lawson,\n683 F.2d at 694 (delay not “engineered by the government for an improper purpose, such as gaining\na tactical advantage”); Snyder, 668 F.2d at 689; United States v. Watson, 599 F.2d ll49, ll56 n.5\n(2d Cir. l979); United States v. Tanu, 589 F.2d 82, 89 (2d Cir. l978); United States v. Laurenti,\n58l F.2d 37, 4o n.ll (2d Cir. l978); United States v. Hillegas, 578 F.2d 453, 46o (2d Cir. l978).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nBecause the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the\ndefendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment\ndelay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL\n4o43l4o, at *5. In any event, in denying the defendant’s pre-trial motions and supplemental pre-\ntrial motions, the Court noted the absence of “evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing\nthese charges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Dkt. No. 2o7 at\nl7; Dkt. No. 3l7 at lo). That remains true.\n\n45\nDOJ-OGR- oooo96o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009609.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 47 of5l\n\nAs the Government explained in its memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s twelve\npre-trial motions, dated February 26, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 2o4 at 4l-59), and in its memorandum in\nopposition to the defendant’s supplemental motions, dated May 2l, 2o2l (Dkt. No. 295 at l3-l6),\nthe Indictments in this case were brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s collection of\nevidence to support the charges. Any suggestion that the Government intentionally delayed\nobtaining the Indictments to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in fact, and for good\nreason: itis not true. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay,\nmuch less an <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nIn her current motion, the defendant offers no additional argument or factual claims\nwhatsoever in support of her argument that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. Indeed, she\nignores the second prong of the pre-indictment delay standard and refers the Court back to her\nprior briefing, which this Court has twice considered and rejected. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7; Dkt. No.\n3l7 at lo). If anything, the trial record undermined the defendant’s argument on this prong. In an\neffort to shou the victims’ supposed financial motivations for testifying, the defendant repeatedly\nfocused the jury’s atention on the fact that victims only recently agreed to cooperate with the\nGovernment. That same evidence precludes any argument of <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> delay by the Government.\nThe defendant’s renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon\npre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009723.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3l of 66\ninvidious as an intentionally false answer. United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d\nCir. l993).'! As the Second Circuit held in Langford:\n\nWe read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\n\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,\n\nfor though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before\n\nit, lt stated that the further shouing of cause must be made even after a juror’s\n\n“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various\n\n“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan\n\nsimilarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even lf the\n\njuror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the\n\nproper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this\nsituation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting\nprejudice to the litigant. . .\n... Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer\nwas inadvertent or <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>, are simply factors to be\nconsidered in th[e] . . . determination of actual bias.\n\nLangford, 99o F.2d at 68 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring in judgment)).\n\nThe seminal case addressing a juror’s false answers during voir dire ls\nMcDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood. McDonough was a products liability\naction in which Juror Payton remained silent when the district court asked, “hou many of\nyou [potential jurors] have yourself or any members of your immediate family sustained\nany severe injury [in] an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that result in any\ndisability or prolonged pain and suffering?” 464 U.S. at 55o.

United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d\n65, 68 (2d Cir. l993) (“We read this multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent\nnondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.”); id. at 68\n(adopting Justice Brennan’s reasoning). Accordingly, in the Second Circuit, “a party\nalleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s\nvoir dire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a\nvalid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d\nCir. 2oo6).\n\nOf course, individuals cannot be alloued to lie their way onto a jury. Writing for a\nunanimous Supreme Court, Justice Cardozo concluded: “If the answers to the questions\n[during voir dire] are willfully evasive or knouingly untrue, the talesman, when\naccepted, ls a juror in name only .. . His relation to the court and to the parties is tainted\nin its origin; it is a mere pretense and sham.” Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. l, ll\n(l933). “[A] juror who lies [his] way onto a jury is not really a juror at all; [he is an\ninterloper akin ‘to a stranger who sneaks into the jury room.’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp.\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 66\nor sexual harassment. Juror No. 5o said he did remember the questionnaire’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the questionnaire itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and impartial. Ex. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”). The\nquestionnaire also told potential jurors that it would ask personal questions. /d.\n(“Although some of the questions may appear to be of a personal nature, please\nunderstand that the Court and the parties must learn enough information about each\njuror’s background and experience to select a fair and impartial jury.”’”). A personal\nexperience as a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment is far more\nrelevant to fairness and impartiality than a family member’s or friend’s experience with\nsuch assault, abuse, or harassment. Given the content of the questionnaire and its obvious\npurpose, remembering a question about the later but not the former is simply not\ncredible.\n\nFourth, Juror No. 5o’s post-verdict conduct shous his false answers to the\nquestionnaire were <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>.

He\nalso falsely answered question 25. Then, during voir dire, he claimed that he used only\nFacebook and Instagram and that he had deleted both. In fact, he also used Twiter, and it\nappears he did not delete his Instagram account. This patern of false answers supports a\nfinding of intent and belies mere inadvertence.\n\nFinally, this case is not like other cases in which a juror may have given a false\nanswer to avoid embarrassment,. Juror No. 5o has spoken to numerous media outlets\nabout his service as a juror, has freely admited that he is the victim of sexual abuse and\nsexual assault, and has done the bare minimum to conceal his identity, allouing himself\nto be identified by his first name while posing for pictures and being video recorded.\nJuror No. 5o has not shunned the limelight. He has reveled in it.\n\nD. Had Juror No. 5o answered Questions 25 and 48 truthfully, the parties\nand the Court would have explored whether his other answers were\nfalse.\n\nRegardless of whether Juror No. 5o’s answers were <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> lies or inadvertent\nmisstatements, his false answers to Questions 25 and 48 cast doubt on the truthfulness of\nall his answers, including most particularly those questions designed to expose bias based\non the nature of charges against Ms. Maxwell—Questions 42-5o.\n\nAt the October 2l hearing, this Court emphasized the importance of voir dire, and\nit expressed confidence that it could “smoke out” jurors who did not tell the truth:\nleter was writen by the government with full knouledge that it would be published by\nthe media and effectively silence Juror No. 5o.

Accordingly, the Court should deny the\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial.\n\nI. The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Should Be Denied\n\nA defendant seeking Rule 33 relief based on alleged juror misrepresentations during voir\ndire must satisfy a conjunctive two-part test: “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to\nanswer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response\nwould have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984). The defendant cannot satisfy either prong of the\nMcDonough test.\n\nA. The Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate Falsehood\n\nAs set forth in the Government’s opposition to the Defense Motion, to satisfy the first\nprong, the defendant must demonstrate that the juror commited a deliberate falsehood, not an\nhonest mistake.! (Dkt. No. 643 at ll, l3-l5). There is no evidence in the record that Juror 5o\n' In her reply brief (Dkt. No. 644 at l2-l4), the defendant asks the Court to ignore the Second\nCircuit’s binding, on-point decision in United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll (2d Cir. l994), which\nrequires deliberateness. The Court should reject this invitation.\nThe defendant asserts that Shaoul’s holding that “a defendant must shou . . . that a juror gave a\ndishonest answer,” id. at 8l6, is dicta, claiming that Shaoul was decided on the second prong of\nthe McDonough test. (Dkt. No. 644 at l2). Not so. In Shaoul, the Circuit expressly affirmed the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the defendant “had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement of the\nMcDonough test,” before concluding that he “also cannot satisfy the second part.” /d.; see, e.g.,\nPyet v. Pa. Bldg. Co., 498 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“Our conclusion . . . was an alternative\nholding, not dicta, and continues to bind our Court.”), rev'd on other grounds sub nom., l4 Penn\nPlaza LLC v. Pyet, 56 U.S. 247 (2oo9). This holding stands in stark contrast to the passing\nstatements made in later cases the defendant cites, which did not consider whether the first prong\nrequires deliberateness, much less reject Shaoul. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3-\nOo5 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (explaining that only two “alleged <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> omissions” justified further\ninquiry, but even if proved, neither would have satisfied the second prong); United States v. Greer,\n285 F.3d l58, l7o (2d Cir. 2oo2) (finding it “unnecessary to determine whether, under\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo294\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page3ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. /d. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire ls frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010404.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” /d. (citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice.

At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the questionnaire.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020973.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel47 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.”);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial.

As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C Questionnaire.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o98o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021021.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel95 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 38 of 45\nthat the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an improper purpose and that the\ndelay seriously damaged [her] ability [to] defend against the charges.” Jd. (citing Cornielle, l7l\nF.3d at 75l).\n\nIn its prior rulings, this Court concluded that the Defendant satisfied neither requirement:\nthere was “no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to\nthwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” and she “failed to establish actual prejudice from\nthe Government’s delay.” /d. at 3l6-l7. But, the Court explained, the Defendant could renew\nher motion if the factual record at trial shoued prejudice that the pretrial record did not. The\nDefendant nou renews her motion, identifying a bevy of documentary records and witnesses\nthat, she says, were unavailable because of the Government’s delay. The Court, for the reasons\nstated belou, disagrees and denies the motion.\n\nAs an initial mater, even if the Court accepts all of the Defendant’s contentions in her\nbriefing, her pre-indictment delay claim must fail because the Defendant has made no claim that\nthe Government intentionally delayed the Indictment to gain a tactical advantage over the\nDefendant. United States v. Alameh, 34l F.3d l67, l76 (2d Cir. 2oo3). The Court has twice\nconcluded that “nothing in the record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these\ncharges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” Maxwell, 2o2l WL\n359l8ol, at *5. It is the Defendant’s burden to prove the Government’s improper motive, but in\nher briefing she does not atempt to present evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span> delay for tactical advantage.\nThe Court therefore does not alter its prior conclusion. If anything, as the Government notes,\ntestimony at trial supplied legitimate explanations for the Government’s failure to indict the\nDefendant at an earlier time. For example, several witnesses testified that their cooperation with\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2lo2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021071.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page24 of ll3\n\nAnd even if it were, the Government cannot apply the 2oo3 amendment to §3283\nto offenses that the Government alleges were commited before the enactment of\nthis provision. See Landgraf v. USI Film Prod., 5ll U.S. 244 (l994). Rather, such\noffenses could only have been governed by the l994 version of $3283, pursuant to\nwhich the statute of limitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 and\nDefendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when the Government\ncharged her in 2o2o.

In a trial about child sexual abuse, a juror’s material misstatements on a\njuror Questionnaire, which alloued him to conceal the fact that he was a victim of\nchild sexual abuse, and his post-verdict public statements about the effect of that\ntraumatic experience on his participation as a juror in this case, satisfied the two\nprong test under McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548\n(l984), namely, that the juror failed to answer honestly material questions in voir\ndire and that correct responses would have provided a valid basis for a challenge\nfor cause. Irrespective of whether the juror’s false statements were <span class=\"highlight\">intentional</span>,\nwhich they clearly were, the similarities between the traumatic experiences\ndescribed by the juror and the victims in the case, together with the juror’s public\nstatements, established the juror’s bias.
