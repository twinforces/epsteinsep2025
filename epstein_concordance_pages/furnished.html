Moreover, where the\nGovernment’s provision of particulars is tantamount to an itemized preview of its proof, it creates\nthe very real danger that a defendant will “tailor her testimony to explain away the Government’s\ncase.” Henry, 86l F.

These concerns animate the rule that “if the defendant has\nbeen given adequate notice of the charges against her and can prepare fully for trial with reasonably\ndiligent efforts, the Government cannot be required to disclose additional details about its case.”\nId.\nes Discussion\n\nThere is no basis for a bill of particulars in this case. The charges against the defendant\nare clear from the face of the Indictment, which provides significant detail regarding the charged\ncrimes. As is apparent from the l8-page Indictment, the charges concern the defendant’s\nparticipation in conspiracies to transport and entice minor girls to travel with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein from l994 through l997, and the defendant’s atempt\nto cover up that conduct during her civil deposition testimony in 2ol6. Specifically, the Indictment\nmakes plain that the defendant is charged with engaging in a conspiracy to transport minor girls\nwith intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, engaging in a conspiracy to entice\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l39", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003311.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l36 of 349\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater.

Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !7!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter.

Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his\ncharging decision.\n\nWe cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s atorneys. The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\nirrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\n\nId. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and\nadvice of his atorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to\ncounsel.\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4882", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004884.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 72 of 8o\nreasonable. Such a consideration is both impractical and unfair. There is no equitable\nmethod of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any atempt would\nbe an arbitrary line-drawing exercise that unjustifiably would deem some sophisticated\nand some not. Nor are there any objective criteria that could be used to make that\nassessment accurately. Would sophistication for such purposes be established based\nupon one’s ability to hire one or more atorneys? By the level of education atained by\nthe defendant? Or perhaps by the number of times the defendant has participated in the\ncriminal justice system? There is no measure that could justify assessing reasonableness\nbased upon the so-called sophistication of the defendant.\n\nThe contours of the right to counsel do not vary based upon the characteristics of\nthe individual seeking to invoke it. Our Constitutions safeguard fundamental rights\nequally for all. The right to counsel applies with equal force to the sophisticated and the\nunsophisticated alike. The most experienced defendant, the wealthiest suspect, and\neven the most-seasoned defense atorney are each entitled to rely upon the advice of\ntheir counsel. Notwithstanding Cosby’s wealth, age, number of atorneys, and media\nsavvy, he, too, was entitled to rely upon the advice of his counsel. No level of\nsophistication can alter that fundamental constitutional guarantee.\n\nIn accordance with the advice his atorneys, Cosby relied upon D.A. Castor’s public\nannouncement that he would not be prosecuted. His reliance was reasonable, and it\nresulted in the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right when he was compelled\nto <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span>  self-incriminating testimony. Cosby reasonably relied upon the\nCommonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his\ndeclination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Atorney Castor knew that\nCosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances. Knouing\nthat he induced Cosby’s reliance, and that his decision not to prosecute was designed to\n\n[J-loo-2o2o] - 7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4884", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004996.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 32o Filed o8/l8/2l Page3of4\n\nHonorable Alison J.

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'!

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021309.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONE 3536o38, Pagel37 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l35 of 348\nDivision forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” *”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal... . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief.

Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\n<span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8.

OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022032.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 9 of 38\nl.

Moreover,\n_ While the government would like to limit its discovery obligation to reports, videos and\ndocuments related specifically to night and early morning hours of August lo, 2ol9, the defense\nsubmits that there is a much larger context that lead to those events and the charges against\nMichael Thomas. Indeed, the Atorney General of the United States and the “acting”\ncommissioner of the BOP opened an investigation that was precipitated by the events of August\nlo, 2ol9 but said investigation was much more expansive and in-depth. In November 2ol9, the\n, “acting” commissioner Kathleen Hawks Sawyer stated at a congressional hearing under oath that\nthere were more than 33oo vacancies within the BOP and she was surprised that the BOP was\nable to function with nth issues. She went on to state that: “The vast majority of staff are good,\nhardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched.” (See article atached as\nExhibit E.) The broad depth of the Inspector General’s report presumably was that there were a\nmyriad of systematic issues affecting the BOP that alloued the events of August lo, 2ol9 and\nthe death of Jeffrey Epstein to occur. Accordingly, the defendant is entitled to disclosure of any\nand all of this information, especiaily if it relates to his defense of the charges that have been\ninitiated, It is the defendant’s contention that this report may also contain Brady-Giglio material.\nIndeed, the prosecutors in this case may be denying the defendant his right to this material\nwithout any knouledge of its contents. If so, this is a dereliction of their duty and denies Mr.\n\nThomas important rights that are the foundation of our judicial system.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o32", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023063.jpg": "of the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023147.jpg": "Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nM7l Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023254.jpg": "her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”\n\nE.

She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the interstate nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023147.tif": "Division forwarded to Roth the prior defense submissions, describing them as “an enormous\namount of material” regarding the Epstein mater. On June 3, 2oo8, Sloman sent to Roth a lengthy\nleter from Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations\nwith Epstein’s counsel culminating in the NPA, and addressing Epstein’s claims of professional\nmisconduct. Among the documents submited with the leter were the prosecution memorandum,\none of the proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s\nDecember l9, 2oo7 leter to Sanchez.\n\nAs the review was ongoing in the Office of the Deputy Atorney General, State Atorney\nKrischer mentioned to the USAO’s West Palm Beach manager that Krischer and Epstein’s local\ndefense atorney Jack Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstein’s case that would involve\na 9o-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon learning of this, Villafafia\nwrote to her immediate supervisor: “Please tell me that you are joking. Maybe we should throu\nhim [Epstein] a party and tell him we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia and her immediate\nsupervisor later had phone and email exchanges with Krischer and with Epstein’s local counsel to\ninsist that the state plea comply with the terms of the NPA, or “we will consider it a breach of the\nagreement and proceed accordingly.” !”!\n\nDeputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he had never heard of Epstein before receiving\nStarr’s leter. Follouing the office’s standard protocol, Starr’s leter was handled by John Roth,\nan experienced senior federal prosecutor who had served some years before as an AUSA in the\nUSAO. Roth also told OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR\nthat he did not conduct an independent investigation, interview witnesses, or meet with Epstein’s\ncounsel, and instead limited his review to writen materials submited by Epstein’s atorneys and\nby Sloman to the Deputy Atorney General’s office, as well as materials that the defense team and\nthe USAO had previously provided to CEOS and the Criminal Division front office, and that\nCEOS <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> to him. Roth discussed the mater with two senior staff colleagues, as well as\nwith the Deputy Atorney General, who also reviewed the submissions.\n\nRoth told OPR that it was his understanding that Epstein had reneged on the NPA, and\nbecause he believed the NPA was a “dead leter,” he did not review the terms of the agreement or\nratify it post hoc. On the other hand, Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR he understood that\nthe NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine the federal jurisdictional basis\nfor the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism arguments, houever, Deputy\nAtorney General Filip did not believe it was the “mission” of the Office of the Deputy Atorney\nGeneral to review the Epstein case de novo or to examine the NPA’s terms or determine whether\nthe NPA reached the “right balance” between state and federal punishment. He told OPR, “[W]e\nheard an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted a meeting to argue for relief. We didn’t give him a meeting\nand we didn’t give him [any] relief.” Deputy Atorney General Filip told OPR that no one in his\noffice who looked at Epstein’s arguments “felt that it was a sympathetic appeal.” In particular, he\ntold OPR that defense counsel’s argument that there was no basis for a federal prosecution was\n“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s investigation of Epstein was politically motivated\n“Just seemed unserious.”\n\nl Villafafia urged Sloman, “Someone really needs to talk to Barry.”\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l47", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023254.tif": "her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na restitution fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\nrestitution, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\n<span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023296.tif": "In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO <span class=\"highlight\">furnished</span> the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023778.tif": "BP-AO66L.ol2 NCIC CHECK corrm\nMAR 99 ,\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS\nAUTHORIZATION POR RELEASE OF INFORMATION\nNCIC (National Crime Information Center} CHECK\n\nI hereby authorize a representative of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to ebtain any\ninformation on my criminal history background.
