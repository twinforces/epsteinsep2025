Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual\nrelations with Dershouitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but\nalso on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to\nbeing a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshouitz was an eye-witness\nto the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators.\nDershouitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.\nIndeed, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5. Thus, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement with a\nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for\nsexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been <span class=\"highlight\">controversial</span> if\ndisclosed, Dershouitz (along with other members of Epstein’s defense team) and the\nGovernment tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims and the\ngeneral public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in\nEpstein’s sexual abuse.

This determination can be made only after a thorough inves-\ntigation. This should not be confused with an investigation that fails to\nprove a sexual assault occurred. In that case, the investigation would\n\nbe labeled unsubstantiated. The determination that a report is false must\n\nbe supported by evidence that the assault did not happen. (ACP, 2oo5,\n\npp. l2-l3; emphasis in original)\n\n“Evidence that the assault did not happen” must consist of the exis-\ntence of physical or eyewitness evidence as opposed to the mere absence\nof evidence CIACP, 2oo5). Lisak et al (2oo5) compiled findings from studies\nthat addressed the aforementioned issues of categorization, terminology, and\nmethodology and placed a narrouer estimate of the frequency of false rape\nallegations between 2% and lo%. Thus, the most recent, more methodolog-\nically adequate studies have indicated that false allegations are somewhat\nrare. Houever, it is important to note that law enforcement agencies can-\nnot always identify false allegations during the investigation process, as it is\noften the case that litle or no physical or eyewitness evidence exists to sub-\nstantiate that sex was consensual or that the rape never occurred. Houever\nuncommon, false accusations of sexual assault, indeed, occur, and falsely\nalleged perpetrators are thus subject to besmirched reputations, interrup-\ntions in important life functions and, in some cases, incarceration. In the\nevent that an investigation fails to identify a false allegation and the case\nproceeds to prosecution, a psychologically informed conceptualization of\nthe etiology of false allegations could bolster existing evidence that supports\nthe falsehood of a claim.\n\nA brief description of one infamous and <span class=\"highlight\">controversial</span> legal case may\nhelp to elucidate the potential contribution of psychological pathways of\nfalse allegations of sexual assault and the initial and lingering consequences\nfor accused persons.

Houever,\nan understanding of the psychological functioning of the alleged victim\nas considered in the context of available evidence could have informed\nthe investigators about potential motives or cognitive distortions that could\nlead the accuser to file a false rape allegation.

It’s not easy to put\ntogether a case that goes back that far, but it was nothing other than we did the\ninvestigation and we were ready at this time to proceed.?\n\nThe entire focus of the accusations initially aimed at Epstein were nou centered on one\ndefendant alone — Ghislaine Maxwell — at a time when she was already being vilified in the press\nand the public domain. The media coverage was relentless and voluminous: dozens of broadcast\ndocumentaries, tens of streamed videos and podcasts, and publication of some 5o books and\nthousands of superficially writen articles. The tsunami of one-sided, overwhelmingly negative\ncoverage about Ms. Maxwell that folloued the arrest and death of Epstein presented Ms. Maxwell\nas a caricature of evil, a depiction that has inevitably shaped the public’s opinion of her.

For example, Senator Ben Sasse, then—Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Oversight\nSubcommitee, wrote to Atorney General William Barr that “[t]he idea that wealth and connections\ncan buy injustice...is wholly and completely inconsistent with the basic notions of fairness and\nequality that undergird the rule of law enshrined in our Constitution.” Leter from Sen. Sasse to\nAtorney General Barr (Aug. l3, 2ol9).?\n\nThe sad reality is that the shocking lack of accountability for the Epstein and Maxwell\ncriminal conspiracy has “ignited a crisis of public trust in the Department [of Justice] and\nexacerbated the erosion of trust that the American people have in our institutions of republican self—\ngovernment more broadly.” Leter from Senators Sasse, Blumenthal, Cruz, and Blackburn to\nInspector General Horouitz (Dec. 2, 2ol9).?\n\n‘The favorable treatment that Epstein, Maxwell, and their other wealthy co-conspirators\nreceived has created a public view that, so long as a defendant is pouerful enough, he can manipulate\nthe federal criminal justice system. See generally Marc Fisher et al., The Pressure on a Prosecutor: Hou\nEpstein’s Wealth and Pouer Steered Acosta Touard Lenient Deal, WASH. POST (July l2, 2ol9).

Jd. at 293. The court ultimately ruled that the great historical importance of\nthe Hiss case outweighed the minimal interest in preserving secrecy. Id. at 298\n(noting that alleged Soviet espionage against the United States was a <span class=\"highlight\">controversial</span>\nand historically significant issue in domestic politics during the l94os and l95os, and\nto the present day).\n\nDisclosure is being sought in this case due to immense public interest in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s cases, along with public interest in the\ngovernment’s handling of those investigations and prosecutions. The public interest\nidentified by the government—while understandable—is insufficient to warrant\ndisclosure of grand jury materials at this time. The government frames this interest\nas “historical,” yet it is nothing more than widespread and intense public curiosity\nabout an ongoing criminal case. Neither Jn re Petition of National Security Archive,\nnor In re Petition of American Historical Association, support the conclusion that the\nMaxwell grand jury materials should be released. Each of those cases involved\ntestimony dating back at least five decades, along with grand jury testimony relating\nto defendants and witnesses who were deceased.\n\nIn re Biaggi is equally unavailing. In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. l973).\nThat case involved the unsealing of grand jury testimony of a U.S. Congressman,\nMario Biaggi, who had not been indicted, and who waived any protection to secrecy\nby “seeking complete disclosure in the form of a motion requesting disclosure of his\noun testimony for its oun sake.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 493 (2d Cir. l973).
