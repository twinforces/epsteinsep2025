B) (“|S|he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving\naround constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”).\n\nMs. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government\nfrom the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her oun arrest, as would be customary in\nsuch situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll24", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001249.jpg": "Caseel24 o/7o oB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fieadsas/O9F2Ag ePag ef lG\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span>. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool249", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001296.jpg": "CGaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivent Documdil B62 Fileeh662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date.

Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him. Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“particularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez.

From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive.

ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation.

In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3237", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea.

Sloman similarly said that he had the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility.!?7\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003323.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3323", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!” The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003355.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 348\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafia\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3355", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 25o of 348\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou call, please provide the.file number located af tha top of this leter.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”*\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned. n late Janua , as Villafafia and the ria orney prepared to participate\n\ngned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villaf: d the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participat\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\nal The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\nA82 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”°°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims.

The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\nHe In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-4 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of6\n\ne AK did not express any concerns about anything to the atorneys.

Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we . . . didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive.

ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n= Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n54 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004364.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 67 of 349\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\n\noun “emails . .. make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\nDe July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\n\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\n\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4364", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004405.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo8 of 349\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.'”° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “‘no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, . . . we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “T think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”—the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004445.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l48 of 349\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4445", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l74 of 349\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,’ but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.7!®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7\noh In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004477.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l8o of 349\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that. . .\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ... to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that ifhe did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding. In her email, Villafafa\naddressed several issues that she perceived to be the “three main questions” raised by the press coverage.\nl53\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4477", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 25l of 349\nif you have additional questions which invelve this mater, please coniact the office listed above, When\nyou cail, please previde the file number located af the top of this lelter.

For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o9 of 349\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved questionnaire, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a questionnaire by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust questionnaire with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel6ofl7\nThis application is not seeking to conduct unduly invasive questioning, to “pre-try” the\ncase to the venire, to create impressions or sympathies which will help either party during the\ntrial, or to unreasonably extend the time for jury selection. The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936). Like impartiality, bias, prejudice, and\npreconceptions are mental states, making them all the more difficult to identify and assess when\na prospective juror is not forthcoming in revealing these mental atitudes. Limited atorney-\nconducted voir dire will help uncover any potential bias in the jury pool.\nCONCLUSION\nVoir dire is a mutual search between lawyers and the Court to determine whether a\nparticular individual can ensure integrity of the trial process in each case. In the words of a\nfederal appeals judge:\nWe would, as judges, have to ignore what we knou as men to\nassume that only the law and the naked facts carry the burden of\npersuasion.

Young, 47o U.S. l, l8-l9 (l985). When the government uses the term “victim,”\nhouever, it improperly vouches for the credibility of the accusers. E.g., Devey, l38 P.3d at 95.\n\nIt is even more important for the Court to refrain from referring to the accusers as\n“victims” or “minor victims.” This Court serves as the neutral arbiter of the law. And\n\nit is a mater of common knouledge that jurors hang tenaciously upon remarks\n\nmade by the court during the progress of the trial, and if, perchance, they are\n\nenabled to discover the views of the court regarding the effect of a witness’\ntestimony or the merits of the case, they almost invariably follou them.\nState v. Philpot, 66 N.W. 73o, 732 (loua l896). Thus,\n\nA judicial reference to the jury that a complaining witness is a ‘victim’ implicitly\n\ntells the jury that the judge believes that a crime has been commited. For a judge\n\nto communicate to the jury that witnesses were victimized, in a case where the\n\ndefense is that the conduct about which the complaining witness testifies never\n\noccurred, prejudices that defendant unfairly.\nFritzinger v. State, lo A.3d 6o3, 6lo (Del. 2olo).\n\nThere is a final reason no trial participant should refer to the accusers as “minor victims.”\nSeveral charges in this case require proof that Ms. Maxwell knew the accusers were less than\neighteen years old at the time of the alleged conduct.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page6ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6258", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any combination of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Dkt. 4lo-l at l9; Tr. 2758:23-276o:9.\n\nThe evidence at trial concerning Count Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane\nand evidence that corroborated her testimony. Jane testified primarily about being sexually\nabused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm Beach. Tr. 298:l6-3l5:l9. Jane also testified that\nshe traveled several times with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when she was l4, l5 and l6 and was\nsexually abused in Epstein’s residences in New York and New Mexico. Tr. 3l6:2-324:2o. As\nmost of these trips were to New York, the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips consisted\nof a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced there. Tr.\n3l7:2-32l:5. But Jane did recall one trip to New Mexico when she was “l5 or l6.” Tr. 32l:6-\n32l:l3. Jane testified that she flew to New Mexico with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and stayed at\nEpstein’s ranch. Tr. 32l:l4-322:6. She further testified that, at some point while she was there,\nsomeone came to her room and escorted her to Epstein’s room where she was sexually abused.\nTr. 322:7-323:l9.\n\nBased on this testimony and the text of the Jury Note, there is a substantial likelihood that\nthe jury did not convict Ms. Maxwell based on Jane’s testimony about the New York trips, and\ninstead improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in\nNew Mexico. According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that it would\nbe sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had\nintended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and\ncould not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55”:\n\nUnder Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return\n\nflight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage\n\nin sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8942", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009241.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBactien ents 637 Filed&z/24/22agePagee 39 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

(Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no relevance.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its instruction directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “irrelevant,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be incorrect.

Indeed, the Court was already under\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the Defense intended to pursue this line of cross-examination after the\nDaubert hearing. Nov. lo Tr. at l57 (“[D]o you intend to impeach any witnesses based on\nsubstance abuse? .. . Yes.”).\n\nBut the extensive case law cited by the Defense about cross-examining witnesses on their\nsubstance use does not justify the request to admit Dr. Hall’s testimony on substance use and\na For example, in United States v. Vitale, the district court gave the defense “wide\nlatitude when cross-examining [the witness] about his drug use and rehabilitation, including\nquestions about the effects that the drugs had on his ability to perceive events when they\noccurred as well as on his memory at the time of trial.” 459 F.3d at l96. The district court did\nnot, houever, permit the defense to admit the witness’s drug rehabilitation treatment records into\nevidence. /d. Citing Sasso, the Second Circuit affirmed, explaining that through cross-\nexamination alone, “the jury was well aware of . . . [the witness’s] drug abuse and treatment\nhistory.” Jd. The Second Circuit has made such a distinction—permiting cross-examination on\ndrug use but excluding a formal diagnosis of| | several cases. E.g., DiPaolo, 8o4\nF.2d at 23o; Dobson v. Walker, l5o F. App’x 49, 52 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (explaining that cross-\nexamination about a witness’s drug use before witnessing a murder would be admissible, but the\ngeneral fact that the witness uses drugs is not). The Defense does not cite any case law to the\ncontrary. Even the nonbinding authority that the Defense refers to as “instructive,” Def. Br. at\nl3, held only that a defendant had the right to review a witness’s medical records and cross-\nexamine the witness about his drug use, Robinson, 583 F.3d at l27l-75.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011285.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

EPSTEIN told\n\nthat MAXWELL brought him girls.\n\nThe witness continued discussing her “impressions” of the conversation. Nothing in her\n“impressions” about this conversation relate to Epstein using the discussion to further any\nconspiracy. The witness does not indicate that any of the “girls” were underage. The witness\nfurther advised that during the time she worked for Epstein “she did not get the sense that he and\nMAXWELL were still in a romantic relationship.” /d. Accordingly, the context of the statement\nreflects that anything said by Epstein was “idle chater” and not something in furtherance of any\nconspiracy.\n\nThe Court should also exclude this statement under Fed. R. Evid. 4o3 because the\nprobative value of the statement is substantially outweighed by the prejudicial impact to Ms.\nMaxwell. Epstein is dead and not subject to cross examination. It is not clear by the proffer what\nMs. Maxwell “used to do.” The witness could speculate that Epstein meant solicit underage\nfemales but the evidence at trial will establish that Ms. Maxwell hired a number of employees for\nEpstein prior to 2oo4. The statement is overly prejudicial especially when viewed in the context\nof the other evidence that the government claims it will produce at trial, l.e., direct statements\nfrom accusers that Ms. Maxwell recruited them. This post-hoc statement atributed to Epstein by\na cooperating witness (l7 years later) will be used by the government to argue that Epstein\nadmited that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator.

In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her\nspouse’s leter makes clear, after spending a few months away ae Ms. Maxwell\nnoved i so that she could i be within\ndriving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. A §\nl2) (“|Ghislaine| was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against\nher, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> given by the\ngovernment, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a\nfugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in New Hampshire in\nDecember 2ol9, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her\nairest. (See Ex. B) (“|S|he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving\naround constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”).\n\nMs. Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with the government\nfrom the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her oun arrest, as would be customary in\nsuch situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-\nperson meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2ol9, and also\nin January and March 2o2o. The timeline atached to this submission illustrates the extent\nof these contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the\nevent that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.\nWe were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southern District of\nNew York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020167.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, Co83onfeIN 3D6cOMenl4G5l , BilEGH3lo 972 e Rage 7l Gb 9\nPage 7\nwould be forced to wait years for the defendant’s return.\n\nAs the Government has repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that the defendant\ncould successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flee. (Dkt. No.\nloo at l9-2o). Indeed, in rejecting the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail Motion to execute\nanticipatory extradition waivers, the Court noted, among other things, “the likelihood that any\nextradition would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dec. Op. at l3). The Court further noted\nthat the “likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any extradition requests—even\nif she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition entirely—weighs strongly in favor\nof detention.” (/d.). That statement remains true even if the face of the defendant’s newest offer\nto renounce her foreign citizenship.\n\nAs this Court previously found, the defendant has substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, and ouns at least one foreign property of significant value. (Dec.\nOp. at lo-ll). The defendant’s alleged willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not\nfundamentally alter the Court’s conclusions.\n\n2. The Court Should Reject the Defendant’s Proposed Monitorship Condition\n\nNext, the defendant has offered to place a portion of her and her spouse’s assets into a new\naccount that “will be monitored by a retired federal District Court judge and former United States\nAtorney who will function as asset monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.”\n(Mot. at 2). This proposed condition—the details of which are vague—is insufficient to ensure\nthat the defendant appears in Court.\n\nIt first bears noting that the defendant’s finances—and her candor with the Court about\nthose finances— is not an issue of first <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span>. Significantly absent from the defendant’s\nMotion is any atempt to address the Court’s determination that the defendant’s “lack of candor\nraises significant concerns as to whether the Court has nou been provided a full and accurate\npicture of her finances and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of\nrelease.” (Dec. Op. at l6). That is critical because the value of any proposed monitorship would\ndepend entirely on the monitor having a completely accurate picture of the defendant’s finances\nand access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given the Court’s concerns about the\ndefendant’s candor, the Court should hesitate before trusting the defendant to be transparent with\na monitor under her employ.\n\nIn any event, even if the Court were to accept the defendant’s representations about her\nassets at face value, the defendant’s proposal would leave the defendant with significant assets\nunrestrained. In particular, the defendant’s proposal does not in any way restrain her $2 million\ntounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. Although the defendant\nasserts that the monitor would oversee any account into which the proceeds of the sale of the\ndefendant’s properties were deposited, the defendant does not explain hou the monitor—or this\nCourt—would have the authority to force the defendant to deposit foreign assets in a domestic\naccount. As the Government has previously explained, the Government cannot realistically\nrecover assets abroad. Accordingly, the defendant’s proposal would leave her with access to at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020214.jpg": "Casse :27-o8,o284orMMt DoesumePAtl BOR l FROG O22o6 24g Aagee t6l6\nRobertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial\ndetention for three additional months until a December 7, 2o2o trial date. Doc. l94. As bad as\nthe pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a\nstate of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more\nto the current April 5, 2o2l trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last\nSeptember, it was under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that he would be able to meet with his atorneys in person\nin conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the\ndefense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> on\nthat point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with atorneys and\nthen bringing COVID-l9 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted atorney-client meetings at\nthe Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is nou able to impose\nsignificantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La\nPasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.\n\nI. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict\nand Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and\nthe Safety of the Community Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nOn the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s\nrecommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form l3 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the\ninformation contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the\napplicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately\nbelieves that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community\nby releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully\ntailored conditions.\n\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021140.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page93 of ll3\n4lo-l at l9; Tr. 2758:23-276o:9.\n\nCount Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane.

Tr.\n32l:l4-322:6., and, while there, she was sexually abused. Tr. 322:7-323:l9.\n\nBased on Jane’s testimony and the Note, there is a substantial likelihood\nthat the jury improperly based its conviction solely on the sexual abuse that\nJane experienced in New Mexico. The jurors had the mistaken <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that\nit would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found\nthat Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico,\neven though such conduct was not and could not have been “sexual activity in\nviolation of New York Penal Law, Section l3o.55.”\n\nThe corroborating evidence supports the theory that the jury did not\ncredit Jane’s testimony that Maxwell participated in or helped arrange Jane’s\nsexual abuse in New York and was instead focused on her involvement in the\nNew Mexico conduct. The most important piece of evidence corroborating\nJane’s testimony were the flight logs kept by Epstein’s pilot, Dave Rodgers.\nSee GX-662-R. The flight logs were the only contemporaneous evidence\noffered at trial that could corroborate that Jane, in fact, traveled to New York\nand New Mexico and when those trips may have taken place.

Houever, Lourie expressed concern about “geting to the jury” on this issue and noted\nthat he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with\nLourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the mater with him.* Villafafia\nalso recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered\n“narticularly weak.”\n\nOn June 26, 2oo7, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm\nBeach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein atorneys Dershouitz, Black,\nLefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershouitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO\nperspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in\nLefcourt’s leter, Dershouitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case\nbecause these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable\nthat the defense was asking questions in an atempt to gain information about the federal\ninvestigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been\ninvolved.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s atorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be\n“under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey\nobviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According\nto Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie\nexpressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general\ncredibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense\npresentation had not been persuasive.

ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO\n\nRESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION\n\nUSAO internal communications shou that in July 2oo7, Acosta developed, or adopted, the\nbroad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would\nleave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would\naccomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his\nregistration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary\n3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove\nEpstein’s knouledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were l6 or l7 at the time they provided\nmassages.\n\n4 In his writen response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,\n2oo7 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l235", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021240.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N66 3536o38, Page68 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 66 of 348\nMenchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\nbe This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section I.B.l.\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l24o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021281.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lo7 3536o38, Pagelo9 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 348\nfederal court. Sloman similarly said that he had the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the non-prosecution provision\nwas meant to protect named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a sense,” of Epstein’s\nconduct. Although later press coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s connection to\nprominent figures and suggested that the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,\nSloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that the reference to potential co-conspirators was\ndirected touard any of the high-profile individuals who were at the time or subsequently linked\nwith Epstein.!?° Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions about it. He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators. So, ... we wouldn’t be\nprosecuting anybody else, so why not include it? ... I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !”°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. !?”\nls Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl28 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\nWa The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l28l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021321.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document NAT 3536o38, Pagel49 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l47 of 348\nhim/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !”!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl9o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nto A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l32l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021347.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Pagel7/5 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l73 of 348\nd[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”®\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7!\n\n2l7 In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she claimed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021353.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel8l of 258\nSA-l79\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l79 of 348\n\nIn its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, lasked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, ... “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “I always figured Mat just wanted ...to do hera solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of... a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry received by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”?*°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.**4 In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\na3 The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia].

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing.

Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n435 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021484.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o8 3536o39, Paged4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o8 of 348\nto be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*47\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses.

OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“® For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\n\n447 In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n448 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n\n282\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l484", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021988.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl7 Filed l2/l9/l9 Pagel2ofl5 l2\nJbpWnoeC\n\nl the dog away.

In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had litle memory of the meeting, to the best of\nhis recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel\nopined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their\nposition.”\n35\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023078.jpg": "Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state plea, but noted to OPR that his\noun “emails... make clear that this course of action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He\nreferenced, among others, his May l4, 2oo7 email to Villafafia informing her that Acosta was\ndeciding hou he wanted to handle the case. Menchel surmised that a state resolution accomplished\ntwo things that Acosta viewed as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and\nsecond, it afforded more flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would have alloued. Menchel\ntold OPR that the state plea proposal did not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s conduct and\nthat any state plea would have been to an offense that required sexual offender registration. He\ntold OPR, “I don’t think anybody sat around and said, you knou, it’s not that big a deal. That was\nnot the reaction that I think anybody had from the federal side of this case.” Rather, Menchel said,\n“The concern was if we charge him [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”\n\n2. July 2oo7: Villafaia and Menchel Disagree about the Proposed State\nResolution\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she was angry when she received Menchel’s July email explaining\nthat he had proposed to Sanchez resolving the federal investigation through a state plea. In\nVillafafia’s view, the proposed state resolution “didn’t make any sense” and “did not correspond”\nto Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious readily provable\noffense.”® In her view, a plea to a state charge “obviously” would not satisfy this policy. Villafafia\nalso told OPR that in her view, the USAM required the USAO to confer with the investigative\nagency about plea negotiations, and Villafafia did not believe the FBI would be in favor of a state\nplea. Villafafia also believed the CVRA required atorneys for the government to confer with\nvictims before making a plea offer, but the victims had not been consulted about this proposal.\nVillafafia told OPR she had met with some of the victims during the course of the investigation\nwho had negative impressions of the State Atorney’s Office, and she believed that “sending them\nback to the State Atorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.\n\n& This policy was set forth in a September 22, 2oo3 memorandum from then Atorney General John Ashcroft\nregarding “Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and Sentencing”\n(knoun as the “Ashcroft Memo”), which provided, in pertinent part:\n\n[I]n all federal criminal cases, federal prosecutors must charge and pursue the\n\nmost serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts\n\nof the case, except as authorized by an Assistant Atorney General, United States\n\nAtorney, or designated supervisory atorney in the limited circumstances\n\ndescribed belou. The most serious offense or offenses are those that generate the\n\nmost substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, unless a mandatory\n\nminimum sentence or count requiring a consecutive sentence would generate a\n\nlonger sentence. A charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor has a good\n\nfaith doubt, for legal or evidentiary reasons, as to the Government’s ability readily\n\nto prove a charge at trial. Thus, charges should not be filed simply to exert\n\nleverage to induce a plea. Once filed, the most serious readily provable charges\n\nmay not be dismissed except to the extent permited [elsewhere in this\n\nMemorandum].\nSee also Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.B.l.\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23o78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023119.jpg": "federal court.

He speculated\nthat if he read the non-prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafafia and Lourie had\n“thought this through” and “addressed it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who had\nonly limited involvement at this stage, told OPR that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he\nhad “no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation had\nnot developed evidence of “any other potential co-conspirators.

I just didn’t think that there was anybody\nthat it would cover.” She conceded, houever, that she “did not catch the fact that it could be read\nas broadly as people have since read it.”\n\nkK. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to Eliminate the Sexual Offender\n\nRegistration Requirement\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, September 2l, 2oo7, State Atorney Krischer informed\nVillafafia that Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was ready to agree “to all the\nterms” of the NPA—except for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer, defense\ncounsel had proposed that registration be deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or federal\nlaw enforcement felt, at any point during his service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.\nKrischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta about this proposal but had not heard back\nfrom him. Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you nou.” Villafafia told OPR that, to her\nknouledge, Acosta called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a negotiable term. !*°\n\nLater that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for information about the amount of “gain\ntime” Epstein would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her email that she wanted to\ninclude a provision in the NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at least a certain\nnumber of days to make sure he doesn’t try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison\nauthorities to let him out early.” Krischer responded that under the proposal as it then stood,\nEpstein would serve l5 months. He also told Villafafia that a plea to a registrable offense would\nnot prevent Epstein from serving his time “at the stockade”— the local minimum security detention\nfacility. l?’\n\nl25 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global resolution” and other co-conspirators could have\nbeen prosecuted “by any other [U.S. Atorney’s] office in the country.”\n\nl26 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein\ncase or any other mater.\n\nal The State Atorney concluded his email: “Glad we could get this worked out for reasons I won’t put in\nwriting. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.” Villafafia\nresponded, “Sounds great.” When asked about this exchange during her OPR interview, Villafafia said: “Everybody\n\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23ll9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023159.jpg": "him/her by an agency unless a statute provides otherwise.” Whenever a U.S. Atorney closes a\ncase without prosecution, the file should reflect the action taken and the reason for it. USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !”°\n\n2, The nature and seriousness of the offense; '*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4. The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction. A comment to this provision explains:\n\nl2o A comment to this provision directs the prosecutor to consider carefully the extent to which a federal\nprosecution would be consistent with established federal prosecutorial priorities.\n\nl9l A comment to this provision explains that an assessment of the nature and seriousness of the offense must\nalso include consideration of the impact on the victim. The comment further cautions that when restitution is at issue,\n“care should be taken . . . to ensure against contributing to an <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that an offender can escape prosecution\nmerely by returning the spoils of his/her crime.”\n\nl2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l59", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023185.jpg": "d[id]n’t want to have to relive what happened to them.””!’ The co-case agent told OPR that one\nof the “strategies” for dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he\ngenerally remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein case in a way that protected the\nvictims’ identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Atorney who briefly worked with Villafafia on\nthe case after the NPA was signed told OPR that in her meetings with some of the victims, she\nformed the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they were not interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS\nTrial Atorney told OPR that “[the victims] would have testified,” but would have required an\nextensive amount of “victim management” because they were “deeply embarrassed” about\npotentially being labeled as prostitutes. The CEOS Trial Atorney also told OPR that “there were\nobvious weaknesses in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective.”!*\n\nThe contemporaneous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal\nand factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,\nLourie noted that two key issues raised by Villafafia’s proposed charges were whether the USAO\ncould prove that Epstein traveled for the purpose of engaging in sex acts, and the fact that some\nminor victims had told Epstein they were l8. He later opined to Acosta and Menchel that “there\nis some risk on some of the statutes [proposed in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is\nuncharted territory to some degree.” In his July 5, 2oo7 email to Villafafia, Menchel cited Acosta’s\nand Sloman’s “concerns about taking this case because of [the P]etit policy and a number of legal\nissues” and Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised\nmyriad legal and factual challenges in their voluminous leters to the USAO. Defense submissions\natacked the legal theories for a federal prosecution and detailed factors that could have\nundermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable to Epstein and evidence of\nvictim drug and alcohol use, as well as the fact that some victims recruited other victims and\npurportedly lied to Epstein about their ages.\n\nAcosta also recalled that although his “team” had expressed concern about the “trial\nissues,” his oun focus had been on “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure as\nthe Assistant Atorney General in charge of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta had\nbeen involved in efforts to address sex trafficking. He told OPR that one of the “background\nissues” that the Civil Rights Division addressed under his leadership, and which influenced his\nview of the Epstein case, was the distinction between sex trafficking and solicitation of\nprostitution. Specifically, he was concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable\nfederal precedent on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally a mater\nof state concern, and sex trafficking, which remained a developing area of federal interest in\n2oo7.7”\n\nZu In an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent noted that in early 2oo7, when he located a\nvictim living outside of the United States, she clatmed only to “knou Jeffrey Epstein,” and stated that she “moved\naway to distance herself from this situation,” and “asked that [the agent] not bother her with this again.”\n\n2l8 In April 2oo7, a victim who was represented by an atorney paid by Epstein participated in a video-recorded\ninterview with the FBI, with her atorney and his investigator present. This victim denied being involved in, or being\na victim of, criminal activity. Later, the victim obtained new counsel and joined the CVRA litigation as “Jane Doe #2.”\n2l9 In his March 2o, 2oll leter, addressed “To whom it may concern,” and published online in The Daily Beast,\nAcosta described “a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors” by “an army of legal superstars.” Most\nof the allegations made against the prosecutors occurred after the NPA was signed and certainly after Acosta approved\n\nl47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023191.jpg": "In its review of the documentary record, OPR examined an email writen by Villafafia in\n2ol8, more than a decade after the NPA was negotiated, in which she suggested that the two-year\nsentence requirement in the initial “term sheet” provided to the defense was developed by Menchel\nas a favor to defense atorney Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounding this allegation and\ndetermined that there was no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2ol8, after the Miami Herald\ninvestigative report renewed public atention to the case, Villafafia recounted in an email to a\nsupervisory AUSA, a conversation she recalled having had with Sloman about the case.””° In the\nemail, Villafafia stated that she had not been a participant in discussions that led to Acosta’s\ndecision to offer a two-year plea deal, but she added the follouing: “Months (or possibly years)\nlater, I asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-year figure came from. He said\nthat Lily [sic] Ann Sanchez (atorney for Epstein) asked Mr. Menchel to ‘do her a solid’ and\nconvince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”\n\nOPR questioned both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.\nVillafafia told OPR that she had been aware that Menchel and Sanchez were friends. During her\nOPR interview, Villafafia explained:\n\n[A] lot later, I asked Jeff. I said, you knou, “Jeff, where did this two\nyears come from?” And he said, “Well, I always figured that...\nLilly asked Mat to do her a solid,” which I thought was such a\nstrange term, .. . “and to get her a good deal so that she would be in\nEpstein’s good graces” and that that’s where the two years came\nfrom. Although strangely enough, then several years after that, Jeff\nSloman asked me where the two years came from, and I had to\nremind him of that conversation. So Jeff doesn’t knou where the\ntwo years came from.\n\nBecause the email had been expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked Villafafia\nwhether Sloman had affirmatively asserted that the two-year deal was a favor from Menchel to\ndefense counsel, or whether he had stated that he merely “figured” that was the case, but Villafafia\ncould not recall precisely what Sloman had said. At a follou-up interview, Villafafia again said\nthat she was unable to recall whether Sloman’s specific statement was “Lilly asked Mat to do her\na solid, and he did it,” or “TI always figured Mat just wanted ... to do her a solid.” Villafafia stated\nthat she was unaware of any information that “expressly [indicated] that there was any sort of\nexchange of. . . a favor in either direction.”\n\nDuring his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall making such a remark, although he could\nnot rule out the possibility that Villafafia, for whom he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard\nthat in some fashion.” He told OPR that if he did say something to Villafafia about Menchel having\ndone “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could not have meant it seriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s\nnot something that I would have believed. Him doing her a solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing\nfrom my recollection or <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> even after years later.”\n\n225 Villafafia’s email stemmed from a congressional inquiry recetved by the Department concerning the Epstein\ninvestigation and the NPA, to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding.

The atorney\nasked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the\nmater,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**? In late\nJanuary, the New York Post reported that the atorney’s clients had filed a $5o million civil suit\nagainst Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to l8 months in prison\nwhen he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°\n\nBetween January 3l, 2oo8, and May 28, 2oo8, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed\nadditional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was\nsigned.*** In late January 2oo8, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Atorney prepared to participate\n33o The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain\nadditional information.\n\n33l The CEOS Trial Atorney told OPR that she was under the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that she was brought in to help prepare\nfor the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”\n332 Because Sloman and the atorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to\nAcosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter.

It is also my practice not to talk about status before\nthe grand jury.\n\nIn her 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia explained that during these\nexchanges, Villafafia did not inform Edwards of the existence of the NPA because she “did not\nknou whether the NPA remained viable at that time or whether Epstein would enter the state court\nguilty plea that would trigger the NPA.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that she did not inform Edwards\nalso had interactions with other victims’ atorneys. For example, another atorney informed OPR that he spoke to\nVillafafia two to five times concerning the status of the case and each time was told that the case was under\ninvestigation. The atorney noted, “[W]e never got any information out of [Villafafia]. We were never told what was\nhappening or going on to any extent.” Villafafia’s counsel told OPR that Villafafia did not have any interaction with\nthe atorney or his law partner until after Epstein’s state court plea hearing, and that in her writen communications\nresponding to the atorney’s inquiries, she provided information to the extent possible. OPR found no documentation\nthat Villafafia’s communications with the atorney occurred prior to June 3o, 2oo8. Villafafia also had more ministerial\ninteractions with other victims’ counsel, as well as contact regarding their ongoing civil cases.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\n<span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘2S As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the restitution provisions.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of financial gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\n485 As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023320.jpg": "to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and\ntimely information that was consistent with the status of the case and with the USAO’s\ncommunications with victims.*4”\n\nThe decision not to inform victims and their atorneys about the existence of the NPA gave\nvictims and the public the misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel\nto keep the agreement secret from the victims. Moreover, the lack of openness about the NPA\ngave the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in resolving the mater and\nundercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting plea agreement. The overall result of\nthe subjects’ anomalous handling of this case left at least some of the victims feeling ignored and\nfrustrated, failed to promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.\nAlthough OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her obligations in\ndealing with victims, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victims were not\nprioritized by the USAO. In part this was due to the fact that interactions with victims are generally\nhandled by staff in the USAO and the FBI who are trained and have expertise in dealing with\nvictims and other witnesses. Houever, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also\ncontributed to the problems. The government, as it ultimately acknouledged in the CVRA\nlitigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and unified\nfashion.\n\nOPR recognizes that the Epstein investigation occurred soon after the passage of the\nCVRA. In the years since, the Department’s prosecutors and personnel have become more familiar\nwith its provisions. OPR encourages the Department as a whole to take the issues discussed above\ninto account when providing training and direction to its employees regarding victims’ rights to\nensure that in the future, Department atorneys’ actions promote victim inclusion whenever\npossible.“48 For example, although the division of responsibility between the FBI and the USAO\nfor communicating with victims works efficiently and appropriately in the average case, the USAO\nfailed to consider that in a case involving a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving\ninconsistent and confusing communications from the separate entities. In certain cases, such as the\nEpstein case, prosecutors may need to provide more oversight when multiple Department\ncomponents are communicating with victims to avoid providing confusing and contradictory\nmessages.\nindependent of the NPA provision. OPR also notes that impeachment regarding the NPA provision may have\npermited the government to rehabilitate the victims through their prior statements to law enforcement. In other words,\nwhile the USAO’s view concerning potential impeachment was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration of the\ncase agent’s concerns might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the risk of the information being used to\nsignificantly damage the credibility of the victims was lou.\nca In addition to the FBI leters previously discussed, another example of the inconsistent communication can\nbe seen in leters that were to be sent after Epstein entered his guilty plea to two victims residing in foreign countries.\nAlthough OPR was unable to confirm that the two victims actually received the leters, it appears from the records\nOPR reviewed that the government intended to provide them with a standard FBI leter stating that the case was under\ninvestigation while also providing them with a USAO leter stating that the case had been resolved through Epstein’s\nstate guilty plea.\n\n“48 OPR understands that the Department is in the process of revising the 2oll Guidelines.\n282\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2332o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023471.jpg": "inmate was accounted for.’”® Only after all the count slips have been collected from each housing unit, and\nthe numbers on the count slips had been matched to the institution’s overall inmate count sheet, could the\ninstitutional count be deemed “cleared” or completed.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, Noel, and Thomas each prepared and/or\nsigned a false count slip to create the <span class=\"highlight\">impression</span> that they had fulfilled their inmate accountability\nresponsibilities when, in fact, they had not.’”” These individuals admited to the OIG that instead of\nperforming their assigned duties, they pre-filled the count slips with the number of inmates they believed\nwere in the SHU based on what officers from the previous shift had told them and signed off on the\ndocuments knouing that they falsely atested to having completed the counts.
