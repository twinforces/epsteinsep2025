The Florida U.S. Atorney’s Office even\noffered to share the evidence gathered in its investigation with prosecutors and grand juries in the\nother relevant jurisdictions.

What is significant for bail purposes is that\nnotwithstanding this notice of the government’s illegal position, and his knouledge of the\nsubstantial penalties that he would face if charged and convicted, Mr. Epstein made no atempt to\nflee in the approximately six years preceding his arrest.

Mr. Epstein never sought to obtain dual citizenship or took any other steps\nindicative of an intent to flee.

One of the federal charges was l8\nU.S.C. § l59l, the statute charged in this SDNY case. The time period covered by the NPA\nsubsumes the entire time period charged in this SDNY case. The USAO-SDFL acknouledged in\nthe NPA that the very premise for Mr. Epstein to enter into it was “to resolve globally his state\nand federal criminal liability ...” Jd. at 2 (emphasis added).

In addition,\nthe use of the term “the United States” in the co-conspirator immunity provision contrasts with\nthe use elsewhere in the agreement of various terms that refer more specifically to the USAO-\nSDFL. When the government wanted a provision of the NPA to refer only to the USAO-SDFL,\nit knew hou to do so; where it chose not to do so, a different intent is demonstrated.\n\nIndeed, the omission of express language limiting the co-conspirator immunity provision\nto the SDFL was contrary to Justice Department policy. The Justice Manual (formerly the U.S.\nAtorneys’ Manual) expressly provides, and provided at the time the NPA was executed, that “if\npracticable, the atorney for the government should explicitly limit the scope of his/her [non-\nprosecution] agreement to non-prosecution within his/her district.” Justice Manual, Comment to\n§ 9-27.63o.

In\nfact, to the extent it is relevant here, it supports dismissal.\n\nIn Annabi, the government, follouing a guilty plea to one count of a three-count\nindictment in the Eastern District of New York, agreed to move to dismiss the two open counts.\nUnlike here, there was no writen agreement; rather, the prosecutor stated on the record at the\ntime of the plea that “the only agreement that exists between the defendants and the Government\nis that at the time of the imposition of sentence on Count Two, the Government would move to\ndismiss the two open remaining counts as to each defendant.” 77l F.2d at 67l.

These\ncounts are based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997.\n\nCount One of the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell violated l8 U.S.C. § 2422 (nou\n§ 2422(a))' by conspiring to entice “one or more individuals” to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and foreign\ncommerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” Indictment {fj 9-lo.

Telecommunications Act of l996, PL lo4-lo4, Feb. 8,\nl996, Title V, § 5o8, llo Stat. 56. Thus, the provision is referred to herein as § 2422(a).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2656\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002667.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l9 of 25\n\nSince Bridges, the Court has repeatedly emphasized that statutory references to an\n“offense involving” or “offenses involving” certain elements call for such an approach. See\nShular, l4o S.Ct. at 785; Kawashima vy. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2ol2) (interpreting “offenses\nthat involve fraud or deceit” to mean “offenses with elements that necessarily entail fraudulent or\ndeceitful conduct’) (internal punctuation omited); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. l, 7 (2oo4)\n(stating that “offense that .. . involves” language “requires us to look to the elements and the\nnature of the offense . . .rather than to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v.\nDavis, l39 S. Ct. 23l9, 2328 (2ol9) (“In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a\nstatutory phrase must have a fixed meaning.”). Thus, only if the offense “necessarily entails” the\nidentified conduct can it be said to be an “offense involving” that conduct. Kawashima, 565 U.S.\nat 484.\n\nIn United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit used this approach in interpreting l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3237(a), a venue statute that applies to “[a]ny offense involving the use of the mails,\ntransportation in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into\nthe United States.” The court concluded that “[t]he most natural reading” of the statute is “‘to\nconstrue ‘any offense involving’ by reference to the e/ements of the offense at issue.” 393 F.3d\nl92, l98 (D.C. Cir. 2oo4) (emphasis in original). The court then gave an illustrative example of\na case in which a defendant travels in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, commits a federal offense, and then\nreturns home via <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce:\n\n[T]he circumstances surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, but his crime is not an “offense involving” transportation in\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the\n\nstatute in the order in which they are writen suggests that an “offense involv[es]”\n\ntransportation in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce only when such transportation is an element\n\nof the offense.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2667\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002670.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 22 of 25\nU.S.C. § 3283. Counts One and Two arise under l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), which, at the time of the\nalleged conduct, provided that a person could be charged with a criminal offense if she\n“knouingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or\nforeign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, to engage in\nprostitution, or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996) (emphasis added). That statute criminalizes enticing\n“individual[s],” not necessarily children, to cross state lines to engage in sexual activities. In\nother words, the act that violates § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail the enticement of a child\nto travel, because the enticement of an individual of any age satisfies the statute.\n\nFurther, § 2422(a) does not necessarily entail “sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping.”\nl8 U.S.C. § 3283. A substantive § 2422(a) offense is complete when an individual is\n“nersuade[d], induce[d], entice[d], or coerce[d]” to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\nand a conspiracy to commit such an offense is complete when an agreement to “persuade[],\ninduce[], entice[], or coerce[]” an individual to engage in such travel is reached and a single\novert act is commited in furtherance of the agreement. It is immaterial to either offense whether\nany unlawful sexual activity subsequently occurs. Moreover, the intended unlawful sexual\nactivity required to establish a § 2422(a) offense need not involve “sexual or physical abuse, or\nkidnaping”; § 2422(a) is frequently, if not primarily, invoked in prosecutions involving the\nenticement of adults to travel to engage in prostitution, including on a voluntary basis. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Rashkovski, 3ol F.3d ll33, ll35-37 (9th Cir. 2oo2). For all of these reasons,\nCounts One and Two do not charge offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse or\nkidnapping of a child and thus are not subject to § 3283.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo267o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002680.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 5 of l6\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nGhislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to\nStrike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).\n\nAlthough Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring to cause individuals to travel in\n<span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the indictment contains no\nallegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled.’ Moreover, throughout the period alleged in the\nindictment, Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged conduct\nas to her took place.

These\ncounts are based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times between l994 and l997.\n\nCounts Two and Four allege that Ms. Maxwell substantively violated l8 U.S.C. § 2422\n(nou § 2422(a))? and § 2423(a), respectively, by enticing and causing Accuser-] to travel from\nFlorida to New York in order to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein that would violate N.Y.\nPenal Law § l3o.55. Indictment {ff l3, l9. The indictment does not charge Ms. Maxwell with a\nsubstantive Mann Act violation as to any individual other than Accuser-l, nor does it allege that\nMs. Maxwell personally enticed or caused any person other than Accuser-l to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\nor foreign commerce for any reason.\n\nCounts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein “and others” to\nviolate §§ 2422(a) and 2423(a), respectively. Indictment {J 9, l5. Count One alleges that the\nobject of the § 2422(a) conspiracy was to “persuade, induce, entice, and coerce one and more\nindividuals to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and foreign commerce, to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense.” /d. § lo. Count Three alleges that the object of\nthe § 2423(a) conspiracy was to “knouingly transport an individual who had not atained the age\nof l8 in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and foreign commerce, with intent that the individual engage in sexual activity\nfor which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.” Jd. { l6.\n\n* Prior to February 8, l996, this provision constituted the entirety of § 2422; it became § 2422(a) as a result of the\nenactment of additional subsections as of that date.

Ms. Maxwell is not alleged, houever, to have enticed or otherwise caused either\nAccuser-2 or Accuser-3 to travel.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 allegedly took place entirely in London,\nEngland, where Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have “groomed and befriended” Accuser-3 “between\napproximately l994 and l995.” Jd. § 7c. Ms. Maxwell allegedly introduced Accuser-3 to\nEpstein and arranged for “multiple interactions between [Accuser-3] and Epstein,” during which\nMs. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to massage Epstein, knouing that Epstein would engage\nin sex acts with [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd.\n\nAlthough the indictment alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3 during the\nmassages (id.), it does not allege that Epstein’s interactions with Accuser-3 were nonconsensual\nor in violation of any English law. Notably, Ms. Maxwell is not alleged to have met Accuser-3\nand introduced her to Epstein until l994 at the earliest, by which time Accuser-3 had reached age\nl6°—the legal age of consent in England. Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 § 9 (Eng.), 2oo3, c. 42.\nThus, it appears that the “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 that the indictment alleges was lawful\nconduct.\n\nNor does the indictment allege any travel by Accuser-3, in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce\nor otherwise, let alone as a result of any action taken by Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else.\nYet Counts One and Three allege that Ms. Maxwell’s encouragement of Accuser-3 to provide\nmassages to Epstein in the future was somehou an overt act in furtherance of the alleged\n* The government has disclosed that Accuser-3 was born im =—Ses\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2683\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002684.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 9 of l6\n§ 2422(a) and § 2423(a) conspiracies to cause individuals to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign\ncommerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity. /d. 99 lld, l7d.\nARGUMENT\nI. All References to Accuser-3 Should Be Stricken as Surplusage.\n\nUnder Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may strike\nsurplusage from the indictment or information.” “This rule introduces a means of protecting the\ndefendant against immaterial or irrelevant allegations in an indictment or information, which\nmay, houever, be prejudicial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) motions may be granted “where the challenged allegations\nare not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotations omited); see United States v.\nGreebel, No. l5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2684\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002685.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page lo of l6\n\nA. The Indictment Is Insufficient to Allege a Conspiracy as to Accuser-3.\n\nTo establish a § 2422(a) conspiracy violation, the government must shou that Ms.\nMaxwell conspired to “knouingly persuade[], induce[], entice[], or coerce[] any individual to\ntravel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce . . . to engage in prostitution, or in any sexual activity for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a) (l996). To\nestablish a § 2423(a) conspiracy claim, the government must prove that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nto “knouingly transport[] an individual who ha[d] not atained the age of l8 years in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or\nforeign commerce . . . with intent that the individual engage in prostitution, or in any sexual\nactivity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a)\n(l994); l8 U.S.C. § 2423 (l986).4\n\nThe government cannot shou that Ms. Maxwell conspired to commit either offense with\nrespect to Accuser-3. There is no allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign\ncommerce, let alone that Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, or anyone else enticed her or otherwise caused\nher to do so. While the indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage\nEpstein in England “knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages” (Indictment 9 lld, l7d), it alleges no facts connecting those allegations to any\ncontemplated <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign travel by Accuser-3—for any purpose. The indictment thus\ndoes not come close to alleging facts that would establish a conspiracy to violate either § 2422(a)\nor § 2423(a) as to Accuser-3.\n\nMoreover, any charge arising out of a conspiracy with respect to Accuser-3 would be\ntime-barred. The government contends that the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich, at the time of the alleged offenses, provided that a prosecution involving an “offense\n“ Section 2423 was amended effective September l3, l994, to add a subsection (b) and make cosmetic adjustments,\nimmaterial here, to what is nou subsection (a).

While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged\n\nConspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause\none or more individuals to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not.

In other words, Count One requires proof of an\nagreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation\ndoes not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily\nrequire transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2ooo WL l253265, at\n*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2ooo) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422 transportation charge and l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged\nconduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly\ncontentious”).\n\nHere, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the\ndefendant agreed to transport one or more minors <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>, but that she did not agree to entice\nminors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant\nagreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade\nor entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the\ndefendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>, but she did not\nagree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport\none or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending\non the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one\nconspiracy count while acquiting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both\nto transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means\nthat a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the\ndiscretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory\nthat the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature.

Among\nother things, it specifies three minor victims in particular and describes the steps the defendant\ntook with respect to each as part of the charged crimes. See, e.g., Indictment 4/7. Additionally,\nthe Indictment details the types of sex acts that Epstein commited with the minor victims as part\nof the charged crimes and the locations where those acts occurred. See, e.g., id. § 5-6. In this way,\nthe Indictment makes clear the Government’s theory that the defendant groomed three minor girls\nto engage in sex acts in Florida, New Mexico, New York, and London with Epstein between l994\nand l997. The Indictment further specifies during which portion of that period each of those three\nvictims interacted with the defendant and Epstein as minors. See id. §7. Additionally, the\nIndictment identifies the precise answers that the Government alleges constituted perjury, and\nalleges facts, in the earlier portions of the Indictment, that indicate hou and why the Government\nwill seek to prove the answers were false. Compare id. JJ 2l, 23 with id. 9§ l-ll.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003223.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.” On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5o of 348\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3226\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003227.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003372.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel,\nand the use of a facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*” In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°?

It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment.

In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

In\nor around the summer of 2oo2, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-\nold child, was told by another one of Epstein’s underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could\nmake $3oo cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe\n#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4\nto go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the\nphone (a means of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to\nhis mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nJane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large\nbathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face\ndoun on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her\nage and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently commited illegal\nsexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.\n\nEpstein used a means of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these\nsexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce (i.e., on his personal\njet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.\n\n7\nGIUFFRE oo4294\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3743\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003905.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page8ofl7\ninvestigating the underlying charged conspiracy); United States v.

Nor did the allegedly false statements concern the Mann Act Counts, which are\nbased on allegations of enticing women to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce for an illegal sexual\npurpose between l994 and l997. Ms. Maxwell’s responses to questions about, for example,\nwhether she could give a list of people under the age of l8 who came to Epstein’s house or\nwhether she could identify sex toys—which she made in the context of a 2ol6 defamation claim\nbrought by an unrelated person—do not “concern” the Mann Act Counts.\n\nThe government contends that the fact that Ms. Maxwell made these statements in the\ncontext of a civil deposition, as opposed to a criminal investigation, “is of litle moment” because\nshe was supposedly “concerned about the prospect of a criminal investigation at the time of her\ndepositions.” Resp. at l45. That is simply wrong. What Ms. Maxwell, and her lawyers were\n“concerned about” was the abuse of her deposition testimony by unscrupulous lawyers.

The government concedes that it has characterized Accuser-3’s\nlawful, consensual sexual encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on\nAccuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as\n“sexual[] abuse[],” the government has falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it nou\nadmits she did not commit, improperly broadening the charges against her by implying that she\nparticipated in the sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The allegations as to Accuser-3\nare thus irrelevant and prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, the allegation that Ms.\nMaxwell was complicit in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\nFinally, the government effectively concedes that the admissibility of evidence regarding\nAccuser-3 must be litigated under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). While the government’s effort to\nestablish the admissibility of such evidence in its opposition suffers from the same infirmities as\nits inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will respond\nto the government’s admissibility arguments more fully at the appropriate time.\n\nl. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged Conspiracies.\n\nThe Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to (l) violate l8 U.S.C.\n§ 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more individuals to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and\nforeign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment 4 9-lo);\nand (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age l8\nwith the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (/d. J] l5-l6). As an overt\nact in furtherance of these conspiracies, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged\n[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knouing that Epstein intended\nto sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” Jd. JJ lld, l7d (emphasis added). The\nIndictment further alleges that Epstein “sexually abused” Accuser-3. Jd. § 7c.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004221.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl4\n\nThe government also improperly stretches the scope of the alleged conspiracies in a\nfailing atempt to make its allegations regarding Accuser-3 fit within those charges. For\nexample, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual\nactivity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements\nwith Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.”\n(Opp. l62.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to\n“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an\nenticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to\nestablish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause\nminors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege\nthat Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.\n\nThe government commits a similar Freudian slip in its atempt to distinguish United\nStates v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4 (D.D.C. l998), when it states that “the allegations regarding\n[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the conspiracy: grooming a minor\ngirl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. l64 n.59. The “heartland of the\nconspiracy” is actual or contemplated <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful\nsexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The\ngovernment’s opposition repeatedly treats <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel, the linchpin of federal court\nJurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the necessary object of the conspiracies alleged, as a\nthrouaway element of its case.\n\nIn short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer\nestablish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (ll) travel while a minor.

Houever, Annabi, by its oun terms, is inapposite to the\ncircumstances of this case, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will\nabandon certain offenses as part of a negotiated agreement and then a second federal district later\nseeks to charge those very same offenses based on the exact same conduct.

Count One alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice “one and more individuals” to\ntravel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and foreign commerce to engage in “sexual activity for which a person can be\ncharged with a criminal offense” in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 45 of 349\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 48 of 349\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.7® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n28 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\n“o After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her mmediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I'll tell her to just run it\nthrough you guys.”\n3l OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,\nthat is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records shou, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s atorneys\n“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory\nchain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.\n\n2l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 5l of 349\ndisagreed with her position. Villafafia and a West Palm Beach AUSA with whom she was\nconsulting about the investigation, and who served for a time as her co-counsel, both recalled\nmeeting with Lourie in his office to express their concerns about meeting with defense counsel.\nThey perceived Lourie to be dismissive of their views.*> According to Villafafia, Lourie believed\nthat a meeting with the defense atorneys would be the USAO’s chance to learn the defense’s legal\ntheories and would position the USAO to arrange a debriefing of Epstein, through which the USAO\nmight learn information helpful to a prosecution. Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafafia and\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafaia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n3 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 52 of 349\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.** Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epstein—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcems about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004494.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l97 of 349\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel,\nand the use of a facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l98 of 349\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.*** In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n24s In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\n246 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7.

The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment ff ll-l2); and (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. 9] l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. J l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the conspiracy” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5675\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005830.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 47 of 84\ncorroborative of the accounts of the other Minor Victims. It is also direct evidence of the operation\nof the conspiracy that is probative of the defendant’s intent at the time of the offense. See Op. &\nOrder at lo, Dkt. No. lo6 (“[I]t is anticipated that the three witnesses will provide detailed and\ncorroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts.”);\nsee also United States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (explaining in an <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> stalking\ncase that evidence of earlier abuse that was “similar in nature and severity” demonstrated a “patern\nof activity that was probative of [the defendant’s] intent’).\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is also direct evidence of the offense because it concerns acts\ntaken by the defendant in furtherance of the conspiracies. In particular, ee\nee\nee\n\nIndeed, at a minimum, the defense motion should be denied because the Government’s\nproffered evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is admissible to prove the overt acts involving\nMinor Victim-3 contained in the Indictment. (Indictment ¥J| l3(d), l9(d)). Evidence proving overt\nacts in the Indictment is direct evidence of the offense, and not other-acts evidence. See United\nStates v. James, 52o F. App’x 4l, 45 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (summary order) (“James’s possession of five\npounds of marijuana on December 22, 2oo5, and December 2, 2olo, were charged as overt acts in\nthe indictment. Accordingly, evidence of James’s possession of marijuana on these occasions was\nnot subject to the structures of Rule 4o4(b).”). The Court previously denied the defense’s motion\nto strike the overt acts involving Minor Victim-3 as surplusage, explaining that it “may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo583o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 52\n\nThe very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\ninstruction on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the conspiracy. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a conspiracy because Curley was not charged with a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> violation of\na protection order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\nconspiracy. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47. But as the defense pointed out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as\nevidence of a conspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.’ United States\nv. Cummings, 6o F. Supp. 3d 434, 437 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol4), vacated on other grounds 858 F.3d 763\n(2d Cir. 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Bagaric, 7o6 F.2d 42, 64 (2d Cir. l983)).

See Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Strike Surplusage from\nSuperseding Indictment (Dkt. l46) at l-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (l) according to\nAccuser-3’s oun allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (l6\nyears old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were\nlawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any\ntravel by Accuser-3, in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any\naction taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged\nconspiracies. /d. at 4-5.\n\nIn its opposition, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a\nmuch fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s\nPretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59 & n.56.

The\ngovernment also represented for the first time that Accuser-3 is expected to testify that\nId. Accordingly, Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was a minor when she traveled or when she\nallegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the United States.\n\nDespite having been alerted to the problems with Accuser-3’s evidence, the government\nrepeated the same allegations related to Accuser-3 in the second superseding indictment filed\nafter the pretrial motions were fully briefed. See S2 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. l87) (“S2\nIndictment”) {ff 9(c), l3(d), l9(d).

Evidence Related to Accuser-3 Is Not Proof of the Charged Conspiracies\n\nAccuser-3’s allegations, which pertain only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged in\nCounts One and Three of the S2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not\noffer any proof supporting those charges. The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment 44 ll-l2); and (ll) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. J§ l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. 9§ l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity.

It is also direct evidence of the operation\nof the conspiracy that is probative of the defendant’s intent at the time of the offense. See Op. &\nOrder at lo, Dkt. No. lo6 (“[I]t is anticipated that the three witnesses will provide detailed and\ncorroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts.”);\nsee also United States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 59 (2d Cir. 2oll) (explaining in an <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> stalking\ncase that evidence of earlier abuse that was “similar in nature and severity” demonstrated a “patern\nof activity that was probative of [the defendant’s] intent’).\n\nMinor Victim-3’s testimony is also direct evidence of the offense because it concerns acts\ntaken by the defendant in furtherance of the conspiracies. In particular, ee\nee\nAccordingly, the defendant atempted to recruit additional victims through Minor Victim-3.\n\nIndeed, at a minimum, the defense motion should be denied because the Government’s\nproffered evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is admissible to prove the overt acts involving\nMinor Victim-3 contained in the Indictment. (Indictment ¥J| l3(d), l9(d)). Evidence proving overt\nacts in the Indictment is direct evidence of the offense, and not other-acts evidence. See United\nStates v. James, 52o F. App’x 4l, 45 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (summary order) (“James’s possession of five\npounds of marijuana on December 22, 2oo5, and December 2, 2olo, were charged as overt acts in\nthe indictment. Accordingly, evidence of James’s possession of marijuana on these occasions was\nnot subject to the structures of Rule 4o4(b).”). The Court previously denied the defense’s motion\nto strike the overt acts involving Minor Victim-3 as surplusage, explaining that it “may reflect\nconduct undertaken in furtherance of the charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 52\n\nThe very case the government cites in support of their position, United States v. Curley,\n639 F.3d 5o (2d Cir. 2oll), affirmed the district court’s decision to admit “other act” evidence of\nprior spousal abuse to prove “intent” and “patern” under Rule 4o4(b) “with an appropriate\ninstruction on this evidence’s limited purpose,” not as direct evidence of the conspiracy. See\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 59 (citing United States v. Von Foelkel, l36 F.3d 339, 34o-4l (2d Cir. l998)\n(per curiam) (affirming district court’s decision to admit evidence of prior domestic violence to\nprove defendant’s intent under Rule 4o4(b)). Indeed, the evidence could not have been admited\nas direct evidence of a conspiracy because Curley was not charged with a conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Curley, No. $l o8 Cr. 4o4 (SCR), 2oo9 WL lo6882o9, at *l (S.D.N.Y. Jul. l5,\n2oo9) (defendant was convicted of two counts of stalking and one count of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> violation of\na protection order). Curley therefore supports the defense’s position that the admissibility of yg\n© Vidence must be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nSecond, the government does not confront the defense’s point that simply including\n“other act” evidence in the indictment does not necessarily mean it is direct evidence of the\nconspiracy. See Mot. at 9-lo. Instead, the government engages in circular reasoning by\neffectively arguing that (l) allegations in an indictment are not 4o4(b) evidence, (i) ay\nHEE 2! cgations are in the indictment, (i) therefore they are not 4o4(b) evidence. See\nResp. at 46-47. But as the defense pointed out in its Motion, “other acts” are only admissible as\nevidence of a conspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.’ United States\nv. Cummings, 6o F.

The defense pointed out that this conduct was not alleged in the\nIndictment and could not be a violation of New York law, and therefore the jury should be\ninstructed, similar to Kate and Annie Farmer, that this evidence could not be considered “illegal\nsexual activity” as charged in the Indictment. Tr. 2775:24-2776:4.\n\nIn responding to both requests, the government stressed that there was no risk that the\njury would convict Ms. Maxwell on the Mann Act counts based solely on conduct that did not\nviolate New York law, such as sexual activity in New Mexico. With regard to Annie Farmer’s\ntestimony, the government stated:\n\n! According to the FBI reports of her prior interviews, Jane initially denied that she was sexually abused in New\nMexico. See 35o9-oo8 at 7-ll. Shortly before trial, after being questioned by the government on this topic, Jane\nrecalled for the first time being led to Epstein’s room in New Mexico and being sexually abused. See 35o9-o33 at l.\nShe then reiterated this in her testimony.

The grand jury returned the\nS2 Indictment charging the defendant with knouingly transporting Jane with the intent that Jane\nengage in criminal sexual activity in New York, and aiding and abeting the same, and with\nconspiring to entice and transport minors in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with the intent that they engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York. That is the core of criminality charged in the S2\nIndictment, and it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury\ninstructions.\n\nl. The Proof at Trial and Jury Instructions Captured the Core of Criminality\n\nThe defendant argues that the core of criminality for the Mann Act counts “was a scheme\nby Epstein and [the defendant] to entice or cause underage girls to travel to New York with the\nintent that they would engage in sexual activity in violation of New York law.” (Def. Mot. at 9).\nThat is precisely the theory the Government advanced at trial. As the defendant correctly states,\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9569\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 28 of5l\n\nl. Offenses Charged\n\nTurning to the first Korfant factor, the “criminal offenses charged,” Counts Three and Five\nplainly charge different criminal offenses under l8 U.S.C. § 37l. In particular, Count Three is\npredicated on l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), a provision of the Mann Act that makes it a crime to transport\nminors for illegal sexual activity, whereas Count Five is predicated on l8 U.S.C. § l59l, a\nprovision of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act that makes it a crime to traffic minors for\ncommercial sex acts. As charged in the $2 Indictment, these counts have different legal objects:\nCount Three concerned transporting girls under the age of seventeen to New York for purposes of\nsexual abuse in violation of New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and Count Five concerned commercial\nsex acts with girls under the age of eighteen.\n\nWhen two counts charge conspiracies under § 37l, “[s]imilarity at this general level . . . is\nof limited import,” where the objects of the conspiracies differ. United States v. Villa, No. l2 Cr.\n4o (JBA), 2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669). For example, in Villa, the district court concluded that, under\nthe first Korfant factor, two § 37l offenses were distinct, because the aim of one count was “‘to\ncommit theft from an <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> shipment and to transport stolen property across state lines,”\nwhereas the other conspiracy was “to sell stolen property.” Jd. Similarly, in United States v.\nSatar, Judge Koeltl concluded that two conspiracies charged under § 37l were distinct under\nKorfant, in part because the two counts “charge a separate conspiracy under the defraud clause\nand the offense clause of § 37l, respectively.” United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279, 3o8\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo4), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Stewart, 59o F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2oo9).\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 29of5l\n\nHere, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated on different statutes, but the legal\ndistinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a different age of consent,\nas the age of consent for Count Three was seventeen (by operation of New York law), whereas the\nage of consent for the conspiracy charged in Count Five was eighteen. Second, the conspiracies\nhad a different geographic locus as a result of the different legal objects of the conspiracies: Count\nThree concerned travel to New York, whereas Count Five did not require <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> transportation,\nand concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged in Count Three concerned\ntransporting minors to Epstein’s residence in New York for sexual abuse in violation of state law,\nwhereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid to participate in\nso-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not have charged these\nconspiracies together, because the Trafficking Victims Protection Act was not enacted until 2ooo,\nyears after the defendant and Epstein victimized Jane and Annie Farmer, as charged in the Mann\nAct conspiracy. Moreover, the proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim of the\nsex trafficking conspiracy at age l7, when flight records® established that she travelled with the\ndefendant and Epstein, but that conduct could not have been charged under the Mann Act\nconspiracies, which had a louer age of consent. In short, Counts Three and Five charged\ncategorically different crimes.\n® See Tr. at l855-57 (testimony of pilot David Rodgers regarding Virginia Roberts as a passenger\non flight logs); Government Exhibit 662 (flight records); Government Exhibit l4 (birth certificate\nof Virginia Roberts).\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo959l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 32 of5l\nwhich Kellen took nude photographs of Carolyn for Epstein. (Tr. l529). In short, the S2\nIndictment charged—and the proof at trial established—that there was an additional participant in\nthe sex trafficking conspiracy who was not involved in the Mann Act conspiracies.\n\n4. Overlap of Time\n\nCount Three charged conduct spanning from l994 to 2oo4. Count Five charged conduct\nspanning from 2ool to 2oo4. Of the multiple overt acts charged in Count Three of the S2\nIndictment, only one occurred during the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five: an\novert act regarding efforts to solicit Carolyn to travel with the defendant and Epstein. (Dkt. No.\nl87, { l9(e)). Aside from that single overt act, no other overt act charged in Count Three occurred\nwithin the timeframe of the conspiracy charged in Count Five. Put simply, the gravamen of the\noffense conduct in Count Three occurred in the l99os, while the offense conduct charged in Count\nFive took place in the 2ooos. Thus, although there is some degree of overlap in time frames\nbetween the two counts, it is minimal at best. Accordingly, this factor weighs against a claim of\nmultiplicity, or at best is neutral.\n\n5. Geographic Scope\n\nAlthough the evidence at trial concerned events in multiple states, at Epstein’s multiple\nproperties, the offense conduct in Count Three concerned transporting minors from Florida to New\nYork, for purposes of sexually abusing victims in New York. By contrast, Count Five charged a\nsex trafficking conspiracy which, as the Court instructed the jury, could be established by proof of\nconduct that had a minimal effect on <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, irrespective of whether victims crossed\nstate lines. (Tr. 3o4l-42). As a result, the conspiracy in Count Three was focused on travel to\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9594\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010148.jpg": "CasPACOAR OES DARN l Demo rrem Gia o Fibs DAP ab ate 8 Os6F dfll7l 7\nA-5865\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 23 of 29\n- Stephen Gillers\n\n35.

The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #l5) Was Erroneous and\n\nResulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.\n\nAs the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties\nagree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the follouing\nproof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage\nin criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and\ntransport minors in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,\nthe government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other\nvictims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New\nYork, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the\nMann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove\nthat [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do\nthe same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York\nlaw.’” (quoting Mot. at l) (emphasis in original)).\n\nSimilarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive\namendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act\nconspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law\nwas an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”\nfor those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and\nit is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The\nonly dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo27l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 8of24\nUnder the second element of Count Four, can the defendant be found guilty if the\ndefendant’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico and if\nthe defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,\nbut not the flight to New Mexico?\n\nHence, the question posed by the Jury Note contained two parts. The jury wanted to knou if it\nwas sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if it found (l) that Ms. Maxwell’s\nintent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell\nassisted with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. That is\nthe straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.\n\nThe answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury\ninstruction for the second element of Count Four charged that the government had to prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell “knouingly transported Jane in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\ncommerce with an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged\nwith a criminal offense in violation of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2l (emphasis added)). It was\ntherefore not sufficient to satisfy this element if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. Any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico could not, by definition, be a violation of New York law.\n\nAccordingly, the Jury Note revealed that the jury had a fundamental misunderstanding of\nthe intent requirement under Count Four. The jury needed to be given a supplemental instruction\nclarifying that to convict under Count Four, they needed to find that Ms. Maxwell intended for\nJane to engage in sexual activity in New York and that any sexual activity that occurred in New\nMexico, while it was potentially relevant evidence, could not have violated New York law. The\nCourt’s decision to simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second element of\nCount Four did nothing to cure the misunderstanding because the jury already had those\ninstructions and was still evidently confused about the proof necessary to satisfy Count Four. As\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo274\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel6 of 24\nF.2d 66o, 662 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous. The\nCourt should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°\n\nA. The Criminal Offenses Charged\nThe government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three\nand Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a\ndistinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the\ngovernment claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have\nconceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different\nstatutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (l8 U.S.C. §\n2423(a)). (Ind. 99 ll-l2, l7-l8). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different\nelements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce,\nwhereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. l4 with Instr. l9). Enticement requires persuasion\nor inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)\nrequires that the defendant knou that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,\nwhereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the\ndistinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —\ne.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count\n> As discussed further belou, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy\ncharged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.\n6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s\nconsideration of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is\n“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 77l F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it\nwas not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The\ndefense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See\nUnited States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2ool). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s\nmultiplicity argument.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo282\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010283.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 24\nthree required travel to New York whereas Count Five did not require <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel. (Opp. at\n28). Yet the government still readily concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous\nbecause the conduct underlying these counts is so similar. Count Five is no different.’\n\nIndeed, it is evident from the way the government charged the S2 Indictment that the\nconduct charged in Count Five is part of the same conspiratorial agreement as the conduct\ncharged in Counts One and Three. The Court will recall that Counts Five and Six, the sex\ntrafficking counts, were added to the Indictment after the government located Carolyn and\nsecured her as a witness. These counts are based primarily on her allegations of sexual abuse\nand are therefore limited to the time period from 2ool-2oo4. But in superseding the Indictment,\nthe government did not treat Carolyn’s allegations as a separate conspiracy. Instead, the\ngovernment recognized that the abuse she described was a continuation of the same conspiracy\nand fully incorporated her allegations into the existing Mann Act conspiracies. For example, the\ngovernment expanded the date range of Counts One and Three from l994-l997 to l994-2oo4 to\ninclude Carolyn’s abuse and added an overt act to both counts alleging that Ms. Maxwell\n“invited [Carolyn] to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with Epstein.” (Ind. 9]\nl3e, l9e). Consistent with this charging theory, the government argued to the jury that it could\nconsider all of the evidence related to Carolyn as evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. (Tr.\n2895) (“The first two conspiracy counts are from l994 to 2oo4. Those counts are about Jane,\nCarolyn, and Annie.” (emphasis added)).\n\n7 The cases cited by the government are not to the contrary. In United States v. Villa, No. l2 Cr. 4o (JBA), 2ol4\nWL 252ol3 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), the District Court considered the nature of the offenses in holding that the\nrelevant conspiracies were different but did not rely exclusively on that factor and instead based its decision on a\nthorough analysis of all of the Korfant factors. United States v. Satar, 3l4 F. Supp. 2d 279 (S.D.N-Y. 2oo4) is\ninapposite on this point because the relevant conspiracies were charged under two separate clauses of the general\nconspiracy statue and were therefore distinct conspiracies on their face, whereas the conspiracies in the Indictment\nin this case were all charged under the same clause.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document647_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 24\nrepeatedly, and the Court agreed, that evidence of travel to locations other than New York, and\nsexual abuse that occurred in those locations, was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies. As a\nresult, the jury heard a great deal of testimony from Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer, as well as\nother evidence, about conduct that took place in Epstein’s residences in New Mexico, London,\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and, of course, Florida. Indeed, a large portion of Jane’s testimony,\nwhich was relevant to the Mann Act conspiracies, described incidents of sexual abuse in\nEpstein’s residence in Palm Beach that involved no <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel. (Tr. 298-3l5).\nAccordingly, the geographic scope of Count Five (Florida) was included within the geographic\nscope of Count Three.\n\nCount Five did not describe a separate, independent conspiracy. Rather, it was a smaller\nsubset of the broader overarching conspiracy charged in Count Three. Counts Three and Five\nare therefore multiplicitous. See United States v. Calderone, 982 F.2d 42, 47-48 (2d Cir. l992)\n(finding two conspiracies were multiplicitous where, among other things, the time frame and\ngeographic scope of one conspiracy was entirely contained within the other conspiracy and the\ncore participants were the same); see also id. at 48 (“The Government cannot be permited to\nretry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies, wholly contained within the scope of a\nlarge conspiracy, until it finds one small enough to be proved to the satisfaction of a jury.’’).\n\nC. Common Overt Acts\n\nThe government argues that the lack of common overt acts between Count Three and\nCount Five indicates that they were different conspiracies. (Opp. at 3o). As we explained in our\ninitial Motion, because Count Five was based on Carolyn’s allegations and did not involve Jane,\nKate, or Annie Farmer, that count alleged overt acts specific to Carolyn that were not alleged in\nCount Three. (Mot. at 24; Ind. 9] 25a-d, l9a-e). Nevertheless, because the conspiracy charged\nin Count Five was a subset of the conspiracy charged in Count Three, as discussed above, the\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page3of 45\nDefendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as\nthe Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually\nabuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims. Because the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same\noffense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts. This\nlegal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury. Rather, it\nunderscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of\nconspiring with Epstein to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.\n\nI. The Court grants the Defendant’s multiplicity claim.\n\nThe Defendant was indicted on six counts: (l) conspiracy to entice individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; (2) enticement of individuals under the\nage of seventeen to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal\nunder New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2; (3)\nconspiracy to transport individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce\nwith intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 37l; (4) transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to engage in\nsexual activity illegal under New York law, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8\nUS.C. §§ 2423(a), 2; (5) conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the age of\neighteen, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; and (6) sex trafficking of an individual under the age of\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page /7 of 45\nB. Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment 7 l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment 4 l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.”\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\ncommerce. S2 Indictment 9{ 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Id.\n423. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: The Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name. See Nov. l, 2o2l Tr. at\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657 _ Filed o4/29/22 Page8of45\nmet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the counts are not\nmultiplicitous.\n\nThe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property’’).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement. E.g., Hernandez, 2oo9 WL 3l69226, at\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo374\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010383.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel7 of 45\nFollouing the close of the defense case, the Defendant renewed her previous Rule 29\napplication. /d. at 2736.\n\nIn her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request that the Court “enter a judgment of\nacquital as to all counts.” Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\n<span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo383\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010385.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Pagel9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same. Jury Charge at 32, 37. Count Six applied solely\nto Carolyn during the period 2ool to 2oo4. /d. at 32.\n\nCarolyn testified that when she was under the age of eighteen, the Defendant would call\nher to set up appointments for Carolyn to perform sexualized massages on Epstein. Trial Tr.\nl527, l53o. Carolyn explained the sexual activities that occurred during the massages. /d. at\nl544-47. Carolyn testified that the Defendant saw her naked in the massage room and continued\nto call Carolyn to schedule appointments with Epstein. /d. at l538. She recalled a specific\nincident when she was fourteen in which she was naked in the massage room and the Defendant\ntouched her breasts and commented that Carolyn “had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his\nfriends.” Jd. at l536-38. Carolyn testified that the Defendant knew that she was under the age\nof eighteen and continued to call her to schedule appointments with Epstein after learning that\nfact. Id. at l535. Carolyn further testified that she received money in exchange for performing\nsexualized massages on Epstein. E.g., id. l523. She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43. Documentary evidence, including flight records,\nestablished that Virginia was under the age of eighteen when she met the Defendant and Epstein. See, e.g., id. at\nl855 (December 2ooo flight record including Epstein, the Defendant, and Virginia); see also GX-l4 (birth\ncertificate). Carolyn testified that Virginia recruited her and that Virginia performed sexualized massages on\n\nl9\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010386.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 2o of 45\n\nFinally, Count Three charged the Defendant with conspiracy to transport individuals\nunder the age of seventeen to travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with intent to engage in illegal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. The Government was required to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt: (l) that two or more persons entered into the unlawful agreement charged; (2)\nthe Defendant knouingly and willfully became a member of that conspiracy; (3) one of the\nmembers of the conspiracy knouingly commited at least one overt act; and (4) the overt act that\nthe jury found to have been commited was commited in furtherance of that conspiracy. Jury\nCharge at 4l.\n\nThe Court concludes that the trial evidence supported a finding of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt for each element of Count Three. The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused. Trial Tr. at 3l9-2o.\nJane also testified about the steps taken by the Defendant and Epstein to make her feel\ncomfortable before they began engaging in sexual activity with her and inviting her to travel. Jd.\n299-3o3; see also id. at 348 (Jane testifying that their behavior touard her made her “feel\nspecial’).\n\nOther witnesses testified to similar conduct. Annie testified that after she met Epstein in\nNew York, she was invited to travel with the Defendant and Epstein to New Mexico when she\nwas sixteen. /d. at 2o68-69, 2o75-77. She testified that on this trip, the Defendant and Epstein\ntook her shopping and to the movies. /d. at 2o8o-8l. She also testified that the Defendant\nEpstein in exchange for money.

As noted above, Carolyn testified\nthat the Defendant paid her for performing sexualized massages on Epstein. She also testified\nthat Epstein and the Defendant asked her about her life and family and discussed sexual topics\nwith her. /d. at l533-36. Epstein then invited her to travel generally, and the Defendant invited\nher to travel to Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. /d. at l535, l54o. A reasonable juror\ncould have concluded that the Defendant’s and Epstein’s actions, including their efforts to\nnormalize sexual conduct and invitations for underage girls to travel to New Mexico and the\nCaribbean, were in furtherance of the conspiracy’s goal of transporting minors to New York for\nthe purpose of engaging in sexual activity illegal under New York law. Finally, although the\njury was instructed that it could not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of Kate’s\ntestimony, her testimony corroborated the testimony of other witnesses as to the Defendant’s\nknouledge and role in the conspiracy. /d. at ll77-9o. The Court concludes that this evidence\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict the Defendant for conspiring to transport\nindividuals in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New\nYork law.\n\nAccordingly, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion for a judgment of\nacquital.\nIl. The Court denies the Defendant’s motion claiming a constructive amendment or\n\nprejudicial variance.\n\nThe Defendant also seeks to vacate her convictions as to Counts One, Three, and Four\n(the Mann Act counts) pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33.

It's based on U.S.\n\n7 v.

In\n\n2 case there's any doubt in the minds of the jurors, there does\n\n3 need to be causation. There has to be an effect from the\n\n4 inducement, the persuasion, the enticement.\n\n5) MR. ROHRBACH: First there has to be some sort of\n\n6 causal relationship. That's what the word \"inducement\" means,\n7 for example, as a form of a causal relationship. I'm certainly\n8 not aware of any case or treatise that provided this\n\n9 instruction. Maybe perhaps defense counsel is.

It's already\n23 in the instruction. And to say, you can only satisfy those\n24 words if she caused the travel suggests that there are two\n25 requirements -—- there's the requirement that the defendant\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool433o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00014331.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 765 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 27 of 95 2765\nLCIlMAXl\n\nl induced the travel, and a separate requirement that she caused\n2 the travel. And there's no causal obligation or causal\n\n3 requirement in the statute above and beyond the persuasion,\n\n4 inducement type causal requirement.\n\niy MR.

The use of the word \"dominant\" is a source of\n\nl3 confusion, as Sand has explained.\n\nl4 MR.

That is Sand's proposal to deal\n\nl9 with the issue of the dominant purpose versus one dominant\n2o purpose. There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the instruction \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted instruction,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge.

That is Sand's proposal to deal\n\nl9 with the issue of the dominant purpose versus one dominant\n2o purpose. There is, houever, case law in many circuits where\n2l the instruction \"one dominant purpose\" is accepted instruction,\n22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was\n23 the charge that was given by Judge Rakoff and they said it was\n24 perfectly proper to give that charge.

She told you that Epstein gave her\n\n5 money and gifts and paid for school. That money wasn't free,\n\n6 and part of the cause was geting Jane on the plane with them\n\n7 to go to New York where she was sexually abused.

You knou that from\nl2 Jane's testimony, from Juan Alessi's testimony, and from the\n\nl3 flight records.\n\nl4 The third element is that the defendant intended that\nl5 Jane would engage in sexual activity for which any person can\nl6 be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, and\n\nl7 you're going to learn that it's a crime to engage in sexual\n\nl8 contact with a kid under l7 who is too young to consent.

I expect Judge Nathan will instruct\n8 you that a conspiracy just means an agreement to break the law.\n9 The crime is the agreement and taking some step to carry it\n\nlo out.

The conspiracy counts are\n\nl2 counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl3 The first two conspiracy counts are from l994 to 2oo4.\nl4 Those counts are about Jane, Carolyn, and Annie. Those counts\nl5 charge a conspiracy related to enticement and travel, as we've\nl6 just discussed. We've already talked about hou Maxwell and\n\nl7 Epstein completed these crimes as to Jane. For the conspiracy\nl8 charges, even though Carolyn and Annie were not sexually abused\nl9 in New York, everything about the defendant's and Epstein's\n2o interactions with those girls makes it clear that that is what\n2l they both intended. Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as\n22 part of a broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with\n23 underage girls for abuse.

The phrase \"to transport an individual in\n\nl2 <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce\" means to move or carry or cause someone to\nl3 be moved or carried from one state to another.\n\nl4 The government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell\nl5 personally transported Jane across a state line; it is\n\nl6 sufficient to satisfy the element that Ms. Maxwell was actively\nl7 engaged, either personally or through an agent, in the making\nl8 of the travel arrangements such as by purchasing tickets\n\nl9 necessary for Jane to travel as planned. Ms. Maxwell must have\n2o knouingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce. That means that the government must prove\n22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be\n23 transported and that Jane was being transported in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\n24 commerce. As I've explained, an act is done knouingly when\n25 it's done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool7223\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o3 of 257 3o37\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl accident, mistake, or some innocent reason.\n\n2 It is the defendant's intent that maters here.

Count Four. Transportation of an\n8 individual under the age of l7 to engage in illegal sexual\n\n9 activity. Second element.\n\nlo The second element of Count Four which the government\nll must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell\n\nl2 knouingly transported Jane in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce with the\n\nl3 intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person\nl4 can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York\nl5 law.\n\nl6 Like Count Two, Count Four alleges sexual activity for\nl7 which an individual could be charged with a violation of New\n\nl8 York Penal Law, Section l3o.55, sexual abuse in the third\n\nl9 degree. I've already instructed you regarding that crime, and\n2o those instructions apply equally here.\n2l In order to establish this element, it's not necessary\n22 for the government to prove that the illegal sexual activity\n23 was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for transporting Jane across\n24 state lines. A person may have several different purposes or\n25 motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in varying degree\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00017226.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 767 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 2o5 of 257 3o39\nLCKVMAX8 Charge\n\nl individual under the age of l8.

In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will\nbest ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.\n\nVI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature\n\nMaxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the Sl\nsuperseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allous a court to strike surplusage from an\nindictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be\ngranted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are\ninflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d lo23, lo3o (2d Cir. l996)\n(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the\npresentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect hou\nspecific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. l8-cr-224\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 67o236l, at *l8 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2ol9); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.\nSupp. 2d 45l, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\n\nMaxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage\nbecause the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce or\nwas belou the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she\nargues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an atempt to\nintroduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.\n\nThe Court will not strike any language from the Sl superseding indictment at this\njuncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020786.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel68 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

Analysis\n\nA further summary of the two counts at issue is required. As briefly outlined above,\nCount Three of the Indictment charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, the general federal\nconspiracy statute, with conspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (the Mann Act), by\ntransporting minors across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity criminalized by\nstate law. S2 Indictment §f] l6-l8. In this case, the relevant state offense was New York Penal\nLaw Section l3o.55, which criminalizes sexual contact with an individual knoun to be under the\nage of seventeen. Trial Tr. 3o34-35. The Count Three conspiracy spanned from l994 to 2oo4.\nS2 Indictment | l7. As the Government explained in its summation, the jury could convict the\nDefendant under Count Three based on evidence related to Jane, Carolyn, and Annie Farmer,\nthree victims who testified at trial. Trial Tr. at 2895.*\n\nCount Five of the Indictment also charged the Defendant under l8 U.S.C. § 37l, but for\nconspiring to violate l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l(a) & (b) (the Trafficking Victims Protection Act), by\ntrafficking individuals under the age of eighteen for commercial sex acts that affect <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\ncommerce. S2 Indictment {| 22-24. Count Five’s conspiracy spanned from 2ool to 2oo4. Jd.\n4] 23. The Government explained to the jury that it could convict the Defendant on Count Five\nbased on evidence related to Carolyn and Virginia Roberts. Trial Tr. at 2896.\n\nThe Defendant primarily contends that Count Five is a subset of, is subsumed in, or is\notherwise too similar to Count Three under the Korfant factors. The Court agrees. Although\nsome Korfant factors favor the Government, the weight of the factors—supplemented by a\nreview of the Government’s case presented at trial—demonstrates that the Government has not\n: ae Court permited certain victim witnesses to testify using a pseudonym or first name.

Both Counts Three and Five are charged\nunder the same statute, l8 U.S.C. § 37l, for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United\nStates. But going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two\ncounts differ. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669. Count Three is a conspiracy to violate § 2423(a) and\nCount Five a conspiracy to violate § l59l. These differing statutory objectives entail legal\ndifferences. Count Three, for example, charges unlawful sexual activity (defined as sexual\ntouching of a minor) while Count Five charges commercial sexual activity with a minor. And\neach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count Three but under\neighteen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an agreement with intent to\ntransport across state lines, while Count Five’s agreement requires only intent of sexual activity\nthat affects <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce. These differences push the first Korfant factor in the\nGovernment’s favor. See Estrada, 32o F.3d at l82 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine and one to distribute crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3:l2-CR-4o (JBA),\n2ol4 WL 252ol3, at *4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2ol4), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 7l6 (2d Cir. 2ol8)\n(summary order) (distinguishing between a § 37l conspiracy to “commit theft from an <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\nshipment and to transport stolen property across state lines” and one to “sell stolen property”).\n\nThe Government, houever, errs in suggesting that this factor alone is “fatal” to the\nDefendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. Br. at 29. To the contrary, no single Korfant factor is\ndominant or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668. And courts in this district have found two\nconspiracy counts to be the same offense even when they have different statutory objectives\nbecause both counts can arise from the same agreement.

The Court has deemed Counts One and Five\nmultiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.\nAnd at trial, the jury found the Defendant not guilty on Count Two. Thus, the Court will\nconsider the sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three, Four, and Six. After\nconsidering the arguments and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the\nsufficiency of the evidence—in either the oral application or the post-conviction briefing—for\nCounts Three, Four, or Six. Instead, for these remaining counts, the Defendant simply asserts\nthat the Court should “enter a judgment of acquital as to all counts under Rule 29 . . . because\nthe government failed to prove each element of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nMaxwell Reply at l8, Dkt. No. 647; Maxwell Br. at 3o. The Court disagrees.\n\nThe Court first considers the substantive counts. Count Four charged the Defendant with\nthe substantive count of transportation of an individual under the age of seventeen with intent to\nengage in sexual activity in violation of New York law. This count related only to Jane during\nthe period l994 to l997. The Government was required to establish the follouing elements\nbeyond a reasonable doubt: (l) that the Defendant knouingly transported an individual in\n<span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, as alleged in the Indictment; (2) that the Defendant transported the\nindividual with the intent that the individual would engage in sexual activity for which any\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, as alleged in the Indictment;\nand (3) that the Defendant knew that the individual was less than seventeen years old at the time\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2looo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021002.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel/6 of 22l\nA-376\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page l9 of 45\ncommercial sex act; and (4) the Defendant’s acts were in or affecting <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce; or\nthat the Defendant aided and abeted the same.

She recalled that while money was often left on\nthe sink outside of the massage room, the Defendant paid her directly after massages on one or\ntwo occasions. /d. at l54o-4l. Carolyn’s testimony was corroborated by Shawn, Carolyn’s\nboyfriend at the time, and physical evidence including phone message pads. This evidence was\nplainly sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant commited\nsex trafficking of an individual under eighteen, or aided and abeted Epstein in doing so.?\n\n3 Tf the Court were to conclude that Count Five is not multiplicitous, it would deny the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion\nas to Count Five. Count Five charged the Defendant with participating in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of\nindividuals under the age of eighteen from about 2ool to 2oo4. The evidence that supports the Defendant’s\nconviction of Count Six, the substantive count, also supports the Count Five conspiracy conviction. Additionally,\nJuan Alessi testified that the Defendant approached Virginia Roberts in a parking lot and that he then saw her at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence later that day. Trial Tr. at 84l-43.

The Government presented evidence that\ncould lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the Defendant worked with Epstein between l994\nand 2oo4 to groom minor victims in an effort to transport them to New York to engage in sexual\nactivity illegal under New York law. As noted above, Jane testified in detail about her travel to\nNew York with the Defendant and Epstein where she was sexually abused.

Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\nequipment and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021221.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OAT 3536o38, Page49 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 47 of 348\n\nOn July 24, 2oo6, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Atorney’s\nOffice had charged and arrested Epstein.”® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally\nopened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia\ntold Sloman that the FBI agents “are geting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to\nreview everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal\ncharges against Epstein was August 25, 2oo6. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was\n“appropriate to approach [State Atorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might\ngo?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””\n\nAlthough Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more\nactive role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman\ndirectly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had\nlitle involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her\nemails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the\nimmediate supervisor’s view, houever, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the\ncase, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.’”>?\n\nBy late August 2oo6, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and\nobtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that shou the\ncommunication and travel in <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia\nreported to her supervisors that the State Atorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the\nstate grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to\nrelinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a\nnumber of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply\n“after having contact with Epstein or his atorneys.”\n\nVillafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask\nwhether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve\nvictims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to\ndocument demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some\nvictims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but\n“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia\na8 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that\nOperation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”\n\n29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was\nlikely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some\ntype of relationship between somebody in the [State Atorney’s Office] and the defense team.”\nag After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,\nand Acosta on August 23, 2oo6, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the\ncase?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care.

Villafafia told OPR, houever, that while this\nstrategy might make sense in a white-collar crime case, she did not believe it was appropriate or\nworthwhile in a child exploitation case, in which the perpetrator would be unlikely to confess to\nthe conduct. Villafafia also told OPR that she did not believe the USAO could extract information\nabout the defense legal theories without telling the defense the precise crimes the USAO intended\nto charge, which Villafafia did not want to reveal.\n\n6. February 2oo7: Defense Counsel Meet with Lourie and Villafaia and\n\nPresent the Defense Objections to a Federal Case\n\nAt the February l, 2oo7 meeting with Lourie and Villafafia, Sanchez and Lefcourt set out\narguments that would be repeated throughout the months-long defense campaign to stop the federal\ninvestigation. In support of their arguments, the defense atorneys provided a 25-page leter, along\nwith documents the defense had obtained from the state’s investigative file and potential\nimpeachment material the defense had developed relating to the victims.\n\nIn the leter and at the meeting, defense counsel argued that (l) the allegations did not\nprovide a basis for the exercise of federal jurisdiction; (2) the evidence did not establish that\nEpstein knew girls who provided him with massages were minors; (3) no evidence existed proving\nthat any girl traveled <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> to engage in sex with Epstein; (4) the USAO would violate the\nPetite policy by initiating federal prosecution of a mater that had already been addressed by the\nstate; and (5) there were “forensic barriers” to prosecution, referring to witness credibility issues.\nThe leter suggested that “misleading and inaccurate reports” from the PBPD “may well have\naffected” the USAO’s view of the case. The leter also claimed that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad taken into account the “damaging histories of lies, illegal drug use, and crime” of the state’s\ntwo principal victims (identified by name in the leter), and argued that “with witnesses of their\nilk,” the state might have been unable “to make any case against Epstein at all.” Lourie told OPR\nthat he did not recall the meeting, but Villafafia told OPR that neither she nor Lourie was persuaded\nby the defense presentation at this “listening session.”\n\nB. February — May 2oo7: Villafafia and the FBI Continue to Investigate;\n\nVillafafia Drafts a Prosecution Memorandum and Proposed Indictment for\nUSAO Managers to Review\n\nCorrespondence between Villafafia and defense counsel shou that Villafafia carefully\nconsidered the defense arguments concerning the victims’ credibility, and she reviewed audiotapes\n35 Villafafia told OPR that in a “heated conversation” on the subject, Lourie told them they were not being\n“strategic thinkers.” Her fellou AUSA remembered Lourie’s “strategic thinker” comment as well, but recalled it as\nhaving occurred later in connection with another proposed action in the Epstein case. Lourie did not recall making\nthe statement but acknouledged that he could have.\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021225.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ey as ee 3536o38, Paged3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 5l of 348\nof the state’s victim interviews and partial transcripts provided by defense counsel.*° Villafafia\nalso pursued other investigative steps, which included working with the FBI to locate an expert\nwitness to testify about the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting records\nrelating to Epstein’s business entities, in part to help establish the <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> nexus of Epstein’s\nactivity. On several occasions, Villafafia sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable\nnational expertise in child exploitation cases, about legal issues relating to the case, such as\nwhether charges she was considering required proof that the defendant knew a minor victim’s age.\n\nUSAO procedures generally required that a proposed indictment be accompanied by a\nprosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution memorandum was\nexpected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and address any significant\nprocedural, factual, and legal issues of which the AUSA was aware; witness-related issues;\nexpected defenses; and sentencing issues. Routine prosecutions could be approved by louer-level\nsupervisors, but in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and\napproval by the Criminal Division Chief, the FAUSA, or even the U.S. Atorney.\n\nAccordingly, Villafafia drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum directed to Acosta,\nSloman, Menchel (who had replaced Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the previous\nOctober, when Sloman became the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated May l,\n2oo7, supporting a proposed 6o-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes\nrelating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors. The prosecution memorandum set forth\nlegal issues and potential defenses relating to each proposed charge; explained why certain other\nstatutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting each count and\npotential evidentiary issues; and addressed the viability and credibility of each of the victims who\nwere expected to testify at trial.\n\nVillafafia’s immediate supervisor told OPR that she read the prosecution memorandum,\nhad only a few small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved of it. The\nimmediate supervisor told OPR that she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the\ncase was complex and that Villafafia would need co-counsel.\n\nIn his OPR interview, Lourie recalled thinking that the prosecution memorandum and\nproposed indictment “were very thorough and contained a lot of hard work,” but that he wanted to\nemploy a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially only on the victims that\npresented “the toughest cases” for Epsten—meaning those about whom Epstein had not already\nraised credibility issues to use in cross-examination. Lourie told OPR that although he had some\nconcerns about the case—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on certain legal issues\nand the credibility challenges some of the victims would face—he did not see those concerns as\ninsurmountable and was generally in favor of going forward with the prosecution.\n\nAlthough indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office usually did not require\napproval in Miami, in this case, Lourie understood that “[b]ecause there was front office\ninvolvement from the get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go\n36 Lefcourt and Sanchez provided the recordings during a follou-up meeting with Lourie and Villafafia on\nFebruary 2o, 2oo7, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021370.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lG 3536o38, Pagel98 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l96 of 348\nsuccessful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately\naddressing ways in which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as by\nobtaining Epstein’s missing computer equipment. Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> travel,\nand the use of a facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021371.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON I97 | 3536o38, Pagel99 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l97 of 348\nNotably, in the early 2ooos, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child\nsex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the\nPROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal\ninterest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and\nthe number of victims.\n\nIt is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not\nreached a conviction, acquital, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and\ncertainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state\ncharge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons\nwithout regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct\nunder federal investigation. Acosta acknouledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did\nnot apply. Moreover, the State Atorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption\nof prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding\nwith the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these\ncircumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication\nof the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> repeatedly to prey upon minors.\nThe federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual\nwho engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had\nresidences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has litle doubt that the\nUSAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under\nthe circumstances of this case.”4°\n\nDespite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy\ndid not apply, and the State Atorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance\npending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s\nrole in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed\nthat a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He\nexplained his reasoning to OPR:\n\n245 In 2oo8, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver\nrequests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would\nnot apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors\nexisted, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.\naus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s\nconcerns from those of the other subjects. Houever, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his\nsubordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal\ntheories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and\ndevalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and\ncounsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal\nissues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater\nharm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was\nappropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-\ntrafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the mater through the NPA, which,\nfor the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and alloued Epstein to manipulate the\nstate system to his benefit.\n\nl7l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer equipment associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer equipment.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer equipment.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\nequipment. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer equipment that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer equipment by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\nequipment. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span> .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting <span class=\"highlight\">interstate</span>... commerce. . .

Maxwell only\ncame to the theory she nou advances after a lengthy\ndiscussion spanning ten pages of the transcript.\n(A.387). And that reading is far from clear: the jury’s\nquestion does not ask whether certain facts are suffi-\ncient for guilt; it asks whether Maxwell “can be found\nguilty” if a certain fact is true. Maxwell “can” be found\nguilty based in part on sexual activity occurring in\nNew Mexico, which is probative of Maxwell’s intent\nand role in transporting Jane. That is a perfectly sen-\nsible question for the jury to ask—indeed, it was re-\npeatedly raised by defense counsel to Judge Nathan at\ntrial. (See, e.g., Tr.3l49).\n\nSeting aside the jury note, Maxwell’s position re-\nquires the jury to have reached a series of odd conclu-\nsions. Jane testified at length about her travel to New\nYork and the ensuing sexual abuse there. It would\nmake litle sense for the jury to reject that testimony,\nand then conclude that Maxwell arranged the uniden-\ntified commercial return flight Maxwell nou empha-\nsizes, for which there is no documentary evidence in\nthe record, including no specific corroboration of Max-\nwell’s role in arranging that flight. (Compare Br.79-8o\n(“[T]he jury likely believed that if they found Maxwell\nhad some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from\nNew Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken\nplace, they could convict her on the substantive trans-\nportation count ....”) with Tr.3l33 (defense argument\nthat there is “no evidence” Maxwell arranged a return\nflight from New Mexico)). Maxwell suggests that the\njury thought the flight records to be critical evidence,\nbut the flight logs also demonstrate that Jane was\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021813.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document lo9-l, o9/l7/2o24, 3634o97, Pagel9 of 26\nenough; the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nMaxwell’s motion for a new trial.*4\n\n4.
