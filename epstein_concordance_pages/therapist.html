No. l). Giuffre alleged that Epstein sexually abused\nher, “with the assistance and participation of Maxwell” at “numerous locations” between l999 and\n2oo2, and that Epstein abused more than thirty minors between 2ool and 2oo7 “with the assistance\nof numerous co-conspirators.” (/d. at 3).\n\nDuring the defendant’s first deposition on April 22, 2ol6, the defendant refused to answer\nquestions that she deemed related to consensual adult sexual interactions. (See, e.g., Ex. lo at\n92:2o-93:6). Giuffre moved to compel the defendant to answer, explaining that “[a]t the core of\n[her] allegations is the allegation that [the] Defendant lured her into a sexual situation with the\noffer of a job making money as a massage <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span>; that Epstein always habitually tried to turn\nmassages into sex .. . and that Maxwell recruited other females for an ostensibly proper position,\nsuch as therapeutic masseuse, with knouledge that the intent was for that person would be\npressured to provide sexual gratification to Epstein.” (l5 Civ. 7443 (LAP), Dkt. No. ll37-l at 5-\n6). Giuffre also explained that the defendant’s refusal to answer questions about adult consensual\nsex prevented Giuffre “from seeking legitimate discovery,” such as the identity of people the\ndefendant presently deemed adults. (/d. at 6).\n\nThe Court granted Giuffre’s motion. “[N]otwithstanding” the intrusiveness of the\nquestions and the fact that the defendant had not put her private affairs at issue, “the questions are\ndirected to reveal relevant answers regarding Defendant’s knouledge of Plaintiff’s allegations.”\n© The belou discussion is provided as context for the Court’s consideration of the motion.

At this stage, the defendant must identify defects so fundamental that the charged\nstatements cannot, as a mater of law, support a perjury conviction. She has failed to do so, and\nher motion should be denied.\n\nl. April 2ol6 Deposition\n\nAt the April 2ol6 deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant about hou Giuffre\ncame to Epstein’s home (Ex. lo at l4:9-l7:4), whether hired massage therapists engaged in sexual\nactivity with Epstein (id. at 5l:l3-55:l6), and the defendant’s knouledge of Epstein’s Florida\ncriminal case (id. at l7l:25-l73:l2, l83:25-l86:2l), among other topics. The transcript makes\nclear that when the defendant did not understand a question, she said so. (See, e.g., id. at 9:4-9\n(“[C]an you please clarify the question. I don’t understand what you mean by female, I don’t\nunderstand what you mean by recruit.”), 39:23-24 (“I don’t understand what your question is\nasking.”’), 94:l8-95:4 (“You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap\nme, I will not be trapped.’’), l38:6 (“Define relationship.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a\ngood question, sorry.’’).\n\nCount Five charges the defendant with perjury arising from two colloquies at this\ndeposition. First, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a series of questions about whether the\ndefendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired\n“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-l8). Guiuffre’s counsel asked\nwhether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the\ndefendant testified that they were all adults except for Giuffre, who she acknouledged at least\nclaimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:l8-25l:l2).

Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that traumatic\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false traumatic memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span>. The <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of traumatic events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 6\n\nRocchio, L.M.

Juror 5o elaborated on this statement later in the\nHearing:\n\nI don’t really think about my abuse really much anymore because it doesn’t\n\ndefine me, it doesn’t make me who I am today.

Juror 5o’s answers are telling. First, it shous that the abuse was, understandably, such\na traumatic experience in his life and that he needed to undergo a “healing process” to be able to\ndeal with the abuse. Indeed, Juror 5o disclosed on social media that he sees a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> regularly\nwho, among other things, gave him help “dealing with the stress of the [Maxwell] case.”\n(Motion at 2o). Second, it shous that as part of the healing process, Juror 5o does not identify as\na victim and rejects that label. We do not question in any way the strategies that Juror 5o has\nused to cope with and heal from his traumatic experience. Houever, his statements do reveal\njust hou deeply the trauma affected him and continues to affect him. The objectively correct\nanswer to Question 25 is “yes” if you have been the victim of sexual abuse. That is hou a\nneutral, unbiased juror would have answered that question. But for Juror 5o, the question used a\nlabel that sparked an immediate negative reaction that was tied up with the healing process he\nhas used to deal with his trauma and prevented him from answering accurately.

Despite all of this, I immersed myself in DBT and\nrepaired my emotional health. I began physical therapy and regained my physical mobility. I started\nto rebuild my life.\n\nThe arrests of Epstein and Maxwell in 2ol9 and 2o2o respectively helped me immensely. For\nthe first time, I was finally able to disclose their abuse to close friends and medical providers. Twenty-\nfive years after meeting them, my experience was validated. I could finally see the possibility\nof closure.\n\nThis past November and December, I commuted almost every day from my home in\nPhiladelphia to atend Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial in Manhatan. For weeks I sat in the courtroom\nanonymously, only revealing my identity the day before the verdict. I had to see justice for myself.\n\nAt the age of 48, I feel as if ’'m just starting my life. All those things I assumed I would have\nin life, the things that my siblings and friends have achieved: a career, success, a partner, family, a\nhome, a legacy to be proud of leaving behind were jeopardized for more than two and a half decades.\nThe only pronounced difference between my life experience and theirs is that one day, when I was\ndoing my job I met Ghislaine Maxwell who fed me to Jeffrey Epstein. In more ways than one, they\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo723", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011262.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Pageloofl2\nFT Just as extrinsic evidence on this point was improper during Kate’s cross, so it\nis Improper nou.\nee\nP| Hamilton’s rank speculation about Kate’s motives and intent are not probative\nof any issue in the case.\n\nThe remainder of the affidavit is simply background information about Hamilton and his\nrelationship with Kate. Accordingly, the affidavit reflects no admissible testimony that Hamilton\nmight offer, and he should be precluded from testifying to its contents.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Testimony from Dr. Loftus That Does Not Fit the\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nThe Government understands that the Court has ruled that Dr. Loftus may testify and is not\nseeking to relitigate that issue. Houever, in reviewing transcripts of Dr. Loftus’s testimony in\nother trials, it appears that Dr. Loftus has testified about the suggestive effects of (a) the use of\nleading questions by Government investigators and (b) pressure from therapists to provide more\ndetails about prior experiences (knoun as “response pressure”). Although it is unclear precisely\nwhat “suggestive activities” Dr. Loftus will discuss while on the stand, she should be precluded\nfrom any testimony about activities which do not fit the case.\n\nAs the Court has concluded, “one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry ls ‘fit,’ which\nasks ‘whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.’” (ll/22/2l Mem. Op. & Order at 4). For an expert\nopinion to “fit,” the opinion must “assist the jury’s decision on a relevant question of fact... .”\n(/d.); see Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee notes (explaining that generalized testimony must\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooll262", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o6 Filed o7/l2/22 Pagellofl2\n“fit? the facts of the case”). “Expert evidence can be both pouerful and quite misleading because\nof the difficulty in evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice\nagainst probative force under Rule 4o3 . . . exercises more control over experts than over lay\nwitnesses.” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omited).\n\nDr. Loftus has elsewhere testified that leading questions by the Government and response\npressure can create suggestive memories. But at no time has the defendant elicited testimony from\nJane, Kate, Carolyn, or Annie that they were asked such questions or subject to such pressure.\nAccordingly, testimony from Dr. Loftus on that point does not fit the facts of the case and has no\nprobative value. It also would substantially prejudice the Government by suggesting to the jury—\nwithout evidence—that the Government or a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> manufactured false memories in the Minor\nVictims. Dr. Loftus’s opinion on suggestive activities therefore should not contain testimony\nabout Government questioning or response pressure exerted by therapists.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Testimony from John Lopez About Undisclosed\n\nExhibits\n\nFinally, the Court should preclude testimony from John Lopez about undisclosed exhibits.\nLopez is expected to testify about financial records in the case. Although the defendant sent a\nleter purporting to notice Lopez as an expert witness in an abundance of caution, the Government\nunderstands from conferring with the defense that the defendant does not plan to elicit expert\ntestimony from him.‘\n\n* The Government has also received no supplemental expert notice for Lopez. As the Government\nexplained in its motion to preclude expert testimony from Lopez, the original expert notice was\ninsufficient.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooll263", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012133.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 745 Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll3 of 264 524\nLClQmax4 Jane — Cross\n\nl would happen almost every visit with him which would have been\n2 every two weeks.

Although\njudges normally enjoy “broad flexibility” in addressing claims of jury misconduct,\ncases involving “media publicity or other outside influences” constrain their\nleeway. United States v.

For example, the court refused\ninquiry into Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and\nspecifically whether he spoke with a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> about the case during the trial; the\ndetails of his sexual abuse to assess hou similar it was to the stories of the\naccusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir\ndire; and his public statements both about traumatic memories and his participation\nas a juror.

After briefing, Judge Nathan ordered a lim-\nited hearing focused on Juror 5o’s “potential failure to\nrespond truthfully to questions during the jury selec-\ntion process that asked for that material information.”\n(A.24o; SA35o). Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s re-\nquest to directly question Juror 5o, which was “com-\nmited to [her] sound discretion,” but permited the\nparties to propose questions in advance of the hearing.\n(SA364 (quoting United States v.

The parties did so—and Maxwell\nsubmited a leter renewing her request to question\nJuror 5o directly and proposing twenty-one pages of\nquestions on topics including the nature and length of\nJuror 5o’s sexual abuse, the nature of the sexual abuse\nexperienced by any of Juror 5o’s family or friends, his\noun employment responsibilities, the impact of his\nsexual abuse on his life and personal relationships,\nwhether Juror 5o ever sought mental health counsel-\ning or spoke with a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span>, hou he came to give me-\ndia interviews, and whether he was atempting to be\nviewed as a “champion of victims of sexual abuse.”\n(Dkt.636).\n\nThe District Court held a hearing on March 8, 2o22,\nat which Juror 5o testified under a grant of immunity.\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to three questions\nwere not accurate: Questions 25 (whether he or a close\nassociate had been a victim of a crime), 48 (whether he\nor a friend or family member had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022559.jpg": "Page l67\nl 2oo9 from Brad Edwards, and he allegedly tells them\n2 that he has come across a piece of evidence that\n3 belongs to Epstein, that contains a list of all of\n4 his clients and victims, underage girls, massage\n5 therapists, and his -- and the men who are having sex\n6 with them.

And even to doubt an expert’s\nstatements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“Tt was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a litle food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall I say\n\n| this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it7” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031416.jpg": "Se\nDate: 9/ol/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: 6\nTime: l3:38:o6 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nl-o3-ool498 (Continued)\nOfficer Nault conducted a neighborhood canvas and failed to\nproduce any new information as most of the neighbors were not\nhome at this time.\nOfficer Roberts collected the names of the house guests which\nincluded Nada Narcinkova, DOB o2/2l/95, who is from Slovakia,\nTeala Davies, DOB o2/2o/85, who is a massage <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> from\nCalifornia.

And even to doubt an expert’s\n| statements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axe! met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“It was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a Jitle food out, lovely hors d’oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall T say\nthis? —by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he becarne a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old-—-old-fashioned, unrebabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s\ngoing on here?’ and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—vwithout his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary-admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe school with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl lefi school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a <span class=\"highlight\">therapist</span> present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came m,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhtn-/Awww nrinthis clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acton=cnt &title=The+Fantasist&exnire=acurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 24 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o63", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032295.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: lo\n\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\n\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\n\nStreet Number =:\n\neee sla we «le oF\n\nBirth Date/Age : o/oo/oooo o Employer? .. :\n\nOccupation . . : FAMILY <span class=\"highlight\">THERAPIST</span> Oper Lic No. . :\n\nHome Phone No. : 56l/ooo-oooo Race ... . . : White\n\nSex .. . . . : Female Height © < <« =< o\n\nWewont ..<°. «)¢ o Person Type . : OTHER PERSON\n\nOther Phone Nbr: 56l/ooo-oooo\n\n***X EMPLOYER INFORMATION# **\n\nCase Number. : l-o5-ooo368\n\nEmployer Name : PBC DIVISON OF YOUTH AFFAIRS\n\nAddress - .«. «. : 42oo N AUSTRALIAN AV\n\nCity/State/Zip : WEST PALM BEACH, FL 334o7\n\nPhone Number . : 56l/84o-454o\n\nekkRKKKKK O T H ER PERSON INFORMATION -—- £ 6 ¥*¥k#kkkKK\n\nCase Number .: l-o5-ooo368 Last Name . . : BRYAN, ZACKERY\n\nStreet Number =:\n\nCAE « + « este\n\nBirth Date/Age : Employer? ..:\n\nOccupation . . : STUDENT Oper Lic No. . :\n\nHome Phone No. : Race... .. : White\n\nSOx . + « « « * Mase Height ...o 9. « ¢ o\n\nMeight . .«.». # o Person Type . : OTHER PERSON\n\nOther Phone Nbr:\n\n*** EMPLOYER INFORMATION# ¥**\n\nCase Number. : l-o5-ooo368 Employer Name : SUMMIT CHRISTIAN SCHOOL\n\nAddress .. . : 49oo SUMMIT BV\n\nCity/State/Zip : WEST PALM BEACH, FL 334l5\n\nPhone Number . :\n\nkKkkKKKEKK QO T H ER PERSON INFORMATION - § 7 #k¥RKKKKKE\n\nCase Number . : l-o5-ooo368 Last Name... :\n\nStreet Number :: 7\n\nBirth Date/Age : o/oo/oooo o Employer? ..:\n\nOccupation .. : Oper Lic No. . :\n\nHome Phone No. : it Race’... . «. + White\n\nSex .. +s « « + Male Height « . . =. 2 96\n\nWeight ....: o Person Type . : OTHER PERSON\n\nOther Phone Nbr:\n\nREKKKKEKKE QO T HER PERSON INFORMATION —- £# 8 ¥¥*¥kkkkKKX\n\nCase Number. : l-o5-ooo368 Last Name... :\n\nStreet Number : 2ol CYPRESS TR\n\nCity .. . . . : WEST PALM BEACH, FL 334ll\n\nBirth Date/Age : o/oo/oooo o Employer? ..:\n\nOccupation .. : Oper Lic No. . :\n\nHome Phone No. : 56l/667-9764 Race 2. « « + o\n\nSex .. . . . : Female Hetght. :..,. . #,o\n\no7/26/l7 Page l982 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32295", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032298.jpg": "Date: 2/l7/o6 PALM BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT Page: l3\nTime: ll:36:35 Incident Report Program: CMS3olL\nCase No. .. . : l-o5-ooo368 (Continued)\nher mother and then placed into High Ridge.\nI contacted the School Board Police who provided me the information\nfor Sable Palm, also knoun as High Ridge Family Center 84o - 454o.\n42oo N Australian Avenue, West Palm Beach, Florida.
