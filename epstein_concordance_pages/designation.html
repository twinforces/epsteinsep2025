Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\n<span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s financial means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4) (affirming district court order\nof pretrial release of defendant, a resident and citizen of Denmark-from where defendant\ncould not be extradited-charged with bulk cash smuggling and forfeiture, noting that the\n\n” This Court’s opinion in Zarrab stands only for the proposition that wealthy defendants should\nnot be provided an unfair advantage. It does not, of course, suggest that wealthy defendants\nshould bear a special disadvantage. The facts supporting the Court’s ruling of pretrial detention\nin Zarrab are easily distinguishable. The present case does not have national security\nimplications, Mr. Epstein is a United States citizen (and does not possess any dual citizenship),\nthe only foreign country in which Mr. Epstein maintains a residence (France) has an extradition\ntreaty with the United States, Mr. Epstein’s assets are almost all located in the United States\n(with the exception of his Paris residence), and Mr. Epstein has provided only truthful\ninformation to Pretrial Services.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo285", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000300.jpg": ": Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Pagellofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 ne on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page ll of\nINVESTIGATION OF |\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN |\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\n{Y APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certaln provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\nfollous:\n7A.

Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 6\ncontained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that\nalready alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida.\n\nB. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention\n\nThe defendant’s “slate of highly restrictive” measures which purportedly “amply suffice to\nsecure his release” are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively\nstandard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant’s\nassets—broken out into l4 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient\nelements of the defendant’s proposal belou.\n\nl. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security\n\nThe defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhatan mansion as the primary\nsecurity for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the\ndefendant’s brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.\n\nAs an initial mater, and as noted above, the defendant’s Manhatan mansion has been\nidentified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to\ncommit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ l594(c)(l). Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property follouing a\nconviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g)(4) (“In\nconsidering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer .. . shall decline to accept\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably\nassure the appearance of the person as required.”). And while the defendant offers to also pledge\nhis private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant\nwould not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net\nworth of more than $5oo million, by his oun admission recently sold a second plane and thus\npresumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be.\n\nNor does the proposed security of properties ouned by two identified co-signers\nmeaningfully change the calculus. As further described belou, the defendant provides no\ninformation about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm Beach\nProperty”), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother’s oun net worth.°®\nSimilarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend Mr.\nMitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.\nMitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant’s proffered net worth, the\ndefendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee.\n\nThe proposed security, in sum, should give the Court litle comfort the defendant would\nappear in Court if released on bail.\n\n° Tn fact, the defendant’s oun submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his\nbrother’s exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo334", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000379.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentil4_ Filed o7/l5/l9 Page l4 of l8\n| |\n| SORA HEARING page l3\nCU l| going to be deemed a Level Three sex offender with no |\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, correct? : l |\n: 3 THE COURT: Correct. 7 }\n) 4, MS.

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Nathan\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, NY looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool43o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 6 Filed o7/o6/2o Page 2 of 33\n\nComplaints Disposition\n\nNone\n\nPlaintiff\n\nUSA represented by John S.

Mollo Building\nOne Saint Andrew’s Plaza\nNew York, New York looo7\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\n\nVIA ECF\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nUnited States District Court\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nUnited States Courthouse\n\n4o Foley Square\n\nNew York, New York looo7\n\nRe: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool732", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\n<span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page l of 4\npe N U.S. Department of Justice\nNSF United States Atorney\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order § l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.!

The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a\n‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2oo3 Act®. The effect of this <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is that\nextradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act’, and the\nUnited States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to\nanswer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).\n\n5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject\nto very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 7o. Once a certificate\nis issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In\npractice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 7o.\n\n6. Under Part 2 of the 2oo3 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition\nrequest'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,\nthere is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!\n\n* Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, signed 3l March 2oo3 and ratified on 26 April 2oo7.\n“ The Extradition Act 2oo3 governs extradition to and from the United Kingdom.

Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties.

(Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell.

Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t is a\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 342 of 349\n\nIN RE:\n\nINVESTIGATION OF\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\n\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\n\nfollous:\n\n7A.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo367", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010411.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 45 of 45\ncaptured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced\nby any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant’s\nmotion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with\nCount Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three.\nCount Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant’s participation in the same\ndecade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein,\nto groom and sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six.\nThe Defendant’s sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nCounsel for Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not request sealing or\nredaction of the leter submited by Robert Y. Lewis, Esq., counsel to Sarah Ransome and\nElizabeth Stein. Houever, Mr. Lewis’s leter raises an issue that we believe the Court must\nresolve prior to the sentencing hearing; namely, who may submit victim impact statements to the\nCourt or address the Court at sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).\n\nUnder the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably\nheard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any\nparole proceeding.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense\nin the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of\n“direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only covers victims of\nthe conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly, No. 3:ll-cr-l2l\n(AWT), 2ol2 WL 3l54o9, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. l, 2ol2) (“[T]he determination as to whether\nperson has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is made with reference to the\nconduct underlying the charged offense.) (emphasis added).\n\nThe conduct underlying the offenses charged against Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about\n2oo4.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a victim of Epstein and Ms.\nMaxwell from approximately October 2oo6 to April 2oo7, a full two years after the conduct in\nthis case ended. She therefore does not qualify as a “crime victim” under the CVRA. We do not\nknou when Ms. Stein alleges that she was a victim, but she would also not qualify as a “crime\nvictim” if the conduct she alleges post-dates 2oo4 or she was not a minor. According to\nuncorroborated press reports Ms. Stein claims to have met Maxwell in l994 when Ms. Stein was\n2l years old and not a minor.\n\nIn his leter to the Court, dated June l4, 2o22. Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome and\nMs. Stein be given an opportunity to speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and\nreferences that Ms. Ransome spoke at the hearing conducted by Judge Berman follouing\nEpstein’s death. But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the\nhearing conducted by Judge Berman. Follouing Epstein’s death, the government moved for a\nnolle prosequi to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding that if a defendant\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo53o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010532.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 668 Filed o6/2l/22 Pagelof2\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOCH\nDATE FILED: 6/2l/22\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Ms.\nMaxwell objects to characterization of Sarah Ransome, Maria Farmer, Teresa Helm, and Juliete\nBryant (collectively, the \"Individuals\") as \"victims\" of the counts of conviction and disputes that\nthe Individuals qualify as statutory victims within the definition of a \"crime victim\" contained in\nthe Crime Victims' Rights Act, l8 U.S.C.A. §377l (\"CVRA\").\n\nThe issue that requires resolution in advance of sentencing is whether the Individuals, or\ntheir representatives, have statutory crime victim status under the CVRA. Under the statute,\ndefinition of “crime victim” takes as a given that there has been a “federal offense” commited.\nSee l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Ms. Maxwell asserts that the Individuals are not statutory crime\nvictims of the federal offenses of conviction, which require that (l) each was a minor at the time\nto the alleged abuse, (ll) the alleged abuse occurred during the period alleged in the indictment,\nand (i) the Individuals were “directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of\n[the] Federal offense.” /d.(emphasis added).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo592", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010660.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document673_ Filed o6/24/22 Pagellof3\nU.S. Department of Justice\nse, United States Atorney\nAS. 27) Southern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Yesterday, without having conducted a psychological\nevaluation and without justification, the MDC placed Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch. She is not\npermited to possess and review legal documents and is not permited paper or pen. This has\nprevented her from preparing for sentencing.\n\nMs. Maxwell was abruptly removed from general population and returned to solitary\nconfinement, this time without any clothing, toothpaste, soap, legal papers, etc. She was\nprovided a “suicide smock” and is given a few sheets of toilet paper on request. This morning, a\npsychologist evaluated Ms. Maxwell and determined she is not suicidal.\n\nI met with Ms. Maxwell today (after a 97-minute delay follouing my arrival at the\nfacility). She is not suicidal. Currently, she is unable to properly prepare for sentencing. If Ms.\nMaxwell remains on suicide watch, is prohibited from reviewing legal materials prior to\nsentencing, becomes sleep deprived, and is denied sufficient time to meet with and confer with\ncounsel, we will be formally moving on Monday for an adjournment.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nIn response to the Court’s June 26, 2o22 Order (Dkt. No. 689), the Government and defense\nconferred regarding proposed redactions to motions that have not previously been docketed. The\nGovernment is today docketing nine leters previously filed by the Government, and submiting\nproposed redactions or sealing requests as to four of those leters. The defense has reviewed the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions and does not object.\n\nThe Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).\nAlthough these leters are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access,\nthe limited proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of witnesses,\nincluding individuals who are subjects of the Court’s pseudonym order and information protected\nby Fed. R. Evid. 4l2, and individuals who were not called as witnesses at trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 726 Filed o7/l3/22 Pagellof3\ncom\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED |\n\nUnited States of America,\n\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\n\nALISON J.

Evid. 4l2 and\nthe privacy interests of witnesses, including individuals subject to the Court’s pseudonym order,\nand individuals who were anticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately\ncalled. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court will\nfile unredacted copies of all tems under seal.\n\nThe Court concludes, houever, that the proposed redactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not\nnarrouly tailored. The private information of victim-witnesses who are discussed in the leter\nmay be protected by narrou redactions. Houever, there is no basis to redact the leter’s general\nrequest to identify the proper scope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is\nORDERED to confer with the Government and docket proposed revised redactions on or before\nl2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. The leter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal\nat Dkt. No. 7l2. Because the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is\nrespectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\n\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\n\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\n\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\n\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\n\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\nDOJ-OGR- oool9334", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019335.jpg": "Caseas2oocb-oo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DH29HPabageLot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\n<span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s leter of\nAugust l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permiting the\ndefendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced\nby the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other\ndiscovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should\nbe denied.\"\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,\nsubstantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include\nmaterials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative\nmethods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more\nthan l65,ooo pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense\nLeter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated\ncivil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated\n“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is entirely\nappropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by\nthe issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n' The Government has drafted this leter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed\nmaterials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to\nseal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Leter repeatedly references, and ataches as\nexhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if\nfiled publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate leter, under seal, proposing redactions\nto the Defense Leter and requesting that the atachments to the Defense Leter be filed under seal.\n\nApp.o9o\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9549", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019550.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos Aden (hdc WHE 262 F iB 68h /Pageayef2l ab5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas’”’). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain recipient (the “Recipient”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the Recipient.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\n<span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nApp.o9l\nDOJ-OGR-oool955o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019551.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos ATT (hdc WARE 262 F i688 /Pageageisi ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\nApp.o92\nDOJ-OGR-oool955l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019554.jpg": "OGsedl AZADA SBos ATT thd c WARE 2o2 F i68l /Pageagefi ab4\npe N U.S. Department of Justice\nNSF United States Atorney\n\nSouthern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to propose certain redactions to the\ndefendant’s leter of August l7, 2o2o (the “Defense Leter”) and to request that the exhibits\natached to the Defense Leter be filed under seal during the pendency of an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation. For the reasons set forth belou, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npermit the filing of the Defense Leter with the proposed redactions contained in Exhibit A hereto\n(which itself will be submited to the Court under seal), and that the Court permit all of the exhibits\nto the Defense Leter to be filed under seal. The Government does not object to the public filing\nof the affidavit atached to the Defense Leter in unredacted form. Additionally, the Government\nwill file a redacted version of this leter on the public docket, and separately will submit an\nunreduced version to the Court.\n\nAs an initial mater, the proposed redactions, and the request that the exhibits be filed under\nseal, are consistent with the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> of the underlying material as “Confidential”\nwithin the meaning of the Protective Order in this case. See Protective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36).\nMoreover, as detailed more fully in the Government’s companion submission, that <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> is\nappropriate given the nature of the documents at issue, all of which pertain to the Government’s\npending grand jury investigation.! That alone strongly weighs in favor of permiting the redactions\nand sealed filings at issue: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(6) provides, in relevant part,\n‘To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\nApp.o95\nDOJ-OGR-oool9554", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019564.jpg": "Came 2oo3 o6 ooBBoAUENt DoOcUMeATA o Fuld DSo2 Rag eRhagere is\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Upon arrival at the MDC seven months ago, she was placed on suicide\nwatch though no competent medical professional deemed her in any manner suicidal, nor has any\npsychologist or medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at any time during her detention.\n\nFor weeks she was deprived of legal material, the ability to use a telephone to make personal\ncalls, and the opportunity to exercise and shouer. Clearly, this was an effort to avoid a\nrecurrence of the BOP’s negligence regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary to the way she is\nhyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CCl-Mh <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>: inmate with\nno significant mental health care.\n\nThe overall conditions of detention have had a detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s\nhealth and overall well-being; and she is withering to a shell of her former self — losing weight,\nlosing hair, and losing her ability to concentrate. In addition to the many difficulties impacting\nher review of electronic discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her\nstamina and effectiveness in preparing her defense and conferring with counsel.\n\nHaving been incarcerated in de facto solitary confinement for 225 days and monitored by\ntwo to six guards 24 hours a day with a handheld camera dedicated to capturing her every move,\nexcept when it would record improper conduct on the part of the guards, it is not surprising that\nMs. Maxwell feels she is detained under the control of the Bureau of “Pretrial Punishment.”\n\nVery truly yours,\nBOBBI C.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nDuring oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms.\nMaxwell’s appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while\ndetained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial\nof her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping\nconditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our\nconcerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s sleep and the deleterious effect sleep\ndeprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial.\n\nMs. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a\nflash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms.\nMaxwell’s conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest\nduring the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell\nis classified with the standard CCl-Mh <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>: inmate with no significant mental health\ncare. (See Dkt. l59 at 3.)\n\nContrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears an eye mask when she sleeps” (Dkt. l96\nat 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she\nresorts to using a sock or touel to cover her eyes in an awkward atempt to shield them from\ndisrupting illumination every l5 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a\nvisible bruise over her left eye. The “black eye” is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera\nsurveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as\nthey did in Saturday’s bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who\nhas no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point,\nMDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her\nin the SHU if she did not reveal hou she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of\nthe bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has groun increasingly reluctant to report\ninformation to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. Houever, there\nis concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the\nlights projected into her cell throughout the night.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o348", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-l, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page2 of 2\nAn atorney and any pro se party who is permited to file documents electronically in CM/ECF\nmust notify the Court of a change to the user's mailing address, business address, telephone\nnumber, or e-mail.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29\nmotion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and\ndocumentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based\non constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's\nevidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the\nIndictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,\nbecause the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the\nDefendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.\non pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to\nmultiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count\nThree, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count\nThree. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in\nthe same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,\nJeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will\nenter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing\ndate remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for\nsentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.\nSO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources.

For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen questionnaire about his history of sexual abuse.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>:\n\nIn 2o2o, the Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted for her participation in a scheme\nto entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her\nlongtime companion. The Government at trial presented extensive witness testimony from\nmultiple victim witnesses and others, as well as corroborating documentary and physical\nevidence. The testimony and other trial evidence established the Defendant’s role in grooming\nand recruiting underage girls and using the cover of massage to perpetrate sexual abuse.\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the Court submited to the jury the six counts in the\nIndictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the\nsix counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations\nof federal statutes that target sexual abuse of minors—the Mann Act as to Count Four and the\nTrafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,\nCounts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to\nviolate those same statutes from l994 to 2oo4.\n\nBefore the Court are the Defendant’s post-trial motions making four alternative\narguments for vacating some or all of her five counts of conviction. First, the Defendant argues\nthat judgment may be imposed on only one of the three conspiracy counts (i.e., Counts One,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o984", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021028.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Page2o2 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 45 of 45\ncaptured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced\nby any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant’s\nmotion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with\nCount Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three.\nCount Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant’s participation in the same\ndecade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein,\nto groom and sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nAccordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six.\nThe Defendant’s sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor... is not\n\naregisterable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021517.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o39, Page87 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 34l of 348\nIN RE:\nINVESTIGATION OF\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.\n\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\nfollous:\n7A.

Throughout the weekend, with Villafafia’s Monday\ndeadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to eliminate the sexual offender requirement. On\nSaturday, September 22, 2oo7, Sanchez sent a series of emails to Lourie. In the first, she provided\ndetails from a press report about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty to\nchild sex abuse charges and was sentenced to a term of probation. She noted that she “spoke to\n[M]at [Menchel]” and asked Lourie to call her. Two hours later she sent Lourie a second, lengthy\nemail, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against\nregistration [as a sexual offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been\na “miscommunication” during the September l2, 2oo7 meeting, and that “we only agreed to the\nsolicitation with minors because we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was\nNOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime sexual offender registration was a “life\nsentence” that was “uncalled for,” “does not make sense,” and was “inappropriate” to impose\n“simply [because] the FBI wants it, in return for all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous\nreasons why Epstein should not have to register, including his lack of a prior record or history of\nsexual offenses; the lack of any danger of recidivism; the ease with which he could be “tracked”\nwithout registering; and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state\nregistration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number to Lourie\n“in case you want to speak to him directly.”\n\nIn another email sent less than two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing again\nbecause “you are a very fair person. This resolution in the Epstein case is not reasonable. [I]t isa\nresult of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstein’s atorneys had “consistently\nemphasized their goal of l8 months in a federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable\noffense precluded” a camp <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span>. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly\ninconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration at that\nmeeting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on him is not something anyone will\neventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get a fair result.”\n\nLourie responded to none of the Sanchez emails, but he did reach out to Acosta for a phone\nconversation. By email late that night, at lo:26 p.m., Lefkouitz asked Lourie to phone him.\n\nThe next day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia—\nto “follou up on our conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement that\nEpstein plead to a registrable offense. Lefkouitz wrote that there had been a “misunderstanding”\nat the September l2, 2oo7 meeting:\n\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex\n\nprosecutor for l3 years, told us that solicitation of a minor . . . is not\n\na registerable offense. Houever, as it turned out, [it] is a registerable\n\noffense and our discussion at the meeting was based on a mistaken\n\nassumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein enter two pleas—one to\n\nthe Indictment and a second to a non-registerable charge.\nhas offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I have had coffee with no one.” Krischer told OPR that the “reasons” to which\nhe referred related to the pressure he had been geting from Chief Reiter about the Epstein case.\n\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l2o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023353.jpg": "IN RE:\n\nINVESTIGATION OF\n\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\n\nADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT\nIT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7\n\nof the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as\n\nfollous:\n\n7A.

Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023389.jpg": "obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shoun by a\npreponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges\nand severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s\ncriminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a\nforeign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and\npossession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found\nthat Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain\nsworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine\naspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and\nthe proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was\nunacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the\nconduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with\nhis employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2ol9.\nThis appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.\nIl. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit\nEpstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, at\napproximately 7:2o p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in\nmedia coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a\nhousing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate\npopulation and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well\nas the safety of staff and other inmates.

Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> that\nremoves an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,\nand orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who\nwas the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2ol9, told the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked doun” in their cells for most of the day.\nOther witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\nThe Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate\nWarden l and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons\nthat conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU\ninmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each\ninmate's cell.\nWitnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his atorneys in the atorney\nconference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York atorney logs confirmed that Epstein\nhad daily visits with atorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at\nMCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains\ninformation relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal\ninmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two atorney visits on all but l day he was detained at MCC\nNew York.

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\n<span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\n, |\nDOJ-OGR-ooo236l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023743.jpg": "TABLE OF CONTENTS\nl.

When designating\nan institution for an inmate to serve 4a sentence, the Bureau\nconsiders many factors, including but not limited to, the\nsecurity level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and\njudicial recommendations. Once an institution has been\ndesignated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or\nairlift on which space is available. This entire process often\ntakes several weeks to complete.

Health Services\n\nl. Sick Call\nInmates are advised during their initial screening and physical\nexamination that if they wish to be evaluated by the Health\nServices Department, they must submit @ sick call slip to the\ndepartment. It iS imperative that inmate’s use this system, as\nit helps the department track requests and have inmates seen on a4\nfirst need to be seen basis. If an inmate has a verified chronic\ncondition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, etc.) he will be placed\nin a chronic care clinic and scheduled for appointments\nautomatically.\nSick call slips are available on the housing units and there is a\nsick call box on each unit in which to submit the slips. The\nsick call box on each housing unit will be emptied daily by a\nmember of Health Services Staff and given to the medical staff\nfor triage. Requests will be prioritized in accordance with\ngreatest medical need. Inmates will be charged a $2.oo co-pay\nfee for all non-chronic care, non-emergent appointments.\n\n2.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary <span class=\"highlight\">designation</span> to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023929.jpg": "Re: Sentry access\n\nFrom\n\nTo Charisma Edge\n\nDate 2ol9/o7/l9 l2:ll\n\nSubject: Re: Sentry access\n\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nInmate Epstein (763l8-o54) has been added on Sentry as a religious diet participant.\n>>> Charisma Edge 7/l9/2ol9 7:ol AM >>>\nChaplain,\nFriendly reminder...
