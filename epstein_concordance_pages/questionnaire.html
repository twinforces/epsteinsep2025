The Jury Plan uses voter\nregistration lists as the exclusive source of names of prospective jurors. Jury Plan, Art. IIT.A.\nFrom these names, two master jury wheels are constructed: one for the Manhatan courthouse\nand one for the White Plains courthouse.\n\nThe Jury Plan provides that to fill the master wheels, jurors are to be drawn from each\ncounty's voter registration list. For each county, the proportion of jurors drawn should be the\nsame as the proportion of that county's number of registered voters to the total number of\nregistered voters for all of the counties in the respective wheels. /d., II.A.l, HI.B.\n\nThe Manhatan master wheel contains names drawn from New York, Bronx,\nWestchester, Putnam, and Rockland counties. The White Plains master wheel contains names\nfrom Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Sullivan, and Dutchess counties. For the three\noverlapping counties (Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland), the names are apportioned among\nthe two master wheels so as to “reasonably reflect the relative number of registered voters in\neach county” within the respective wheels. /d., Art.

III.B; see also United States v. Reyes, 934 F. Supp.\n553, 555 (S.D.N.Y l996).\n\nThe Jury Plan further provides that at least once a year, names are to be drawn randomly\nfrom the master jury wheels in an amount sufficient to meet the anticipated demand for jurors for\nthe next six months. Jury Plan, Art. III.D. Those whose names are drawn are sent questionnaires\nto determine their qualifications to sit as jurors, which they are instructed to return within ten\ndays. Jd. Art. HI.E.

As with\nthe master wheels, two separate qualified jury wheels are maintained: one for Manhatan and\none for White Plains. When jurors are needed, names are drawn at random from these wheels,\nand summonses are sent to those whose names are drawn. /d., Art. IV.C; Reyes, 934 F. Supp. at\n556.\n\nIn United States v. Balde, a case currently pending in this District before Judge Failla, the\ndefendant recently submited, in connection with a similar challenge to the use of a White Plains\ngrand jury in a Manhatan case, an analysis from jury composition expert Jeffrey Martin, who\nanalyzed the racial and ethnic composition of the master and qualified jury wheels for Manhatan\nand White Plains. See Declaration of Jeffrey Martin in Support of Motion to Dismiss, U.S. v.\nBalde, No. l:2o-cr-oo28l-KPF, Dkt. No. 6l-l (filed Nov. 9, 2o2o), Exhibit A (“Martin Decl.”).\nBecause the jury wheels are emptied and refilled only every four years, follouing a presidential\nelection, and the defendant in Balde, like Ms. Maxwell, was indicted in June 2o2o, Ms.\nMaxwell’s grand jury was presumably drawn from the same wheels Mr. Martin analyzed.\n\nMr. Martin found significant underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons within\nthe White Plains qualified jury wheel—not only when compared to the eligible juror population\nin the Manhatan counties (Martin Decl. {] 6l-62, 69-7o), but also when compared to the eligible\njuror population of the District as a whole (id. {| 59-6o, 67-68).\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a grand jury selected from a fair\ncross-section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 4l9 U.S. 522, 53o (l975). Ms. Maxwell’s\nright under the Sixth Amendment to a grand jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity applies to the grand jury that indicted her. See, e.g., United States v. Osorio, 8ol F.\nSupp. 966, 973-74 (D. Conn. l992) (rejecting argument that Sixth Amendment’s fair cross-\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002825.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRreied Fieebda22e/? l Pafageot 26 2o\nPlan”), htps://Awww.nysd.uscourts. gov/sites/default/files/pdt/juryplan_feb_2oo9.pdf. :\nThe Jury Plan operates as follous. Every four years, follouing the date of the |\nPresidential Election, two master jury wheels are constructed: one for Manhatan and one for\nWhite Plains. See id. These master wheels, in turn, are filled with names that are randomly |\ndrawn from voter registration lists of the various counties that make up the District. Jd, The Jury :\nPlan provides that “the number of names drawn from each county should be proportionate to the |\nnumber of registered voters in that county.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *l. |\nThe two master wheels draw from a different array of counties. The Manhatan master |\nwheel randomly draws names from New York, Bronx, Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland, :\nwhile the White Plains master wheel draws names from Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,\nSullivan and Dutchess. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *l. Because Westchester, Putnam, and :\nRockland counties are included in both master wheels, the Jury Plan instructs that the names\nfrom these counties be “apportioned among the two master wheels to ‘reasonably reflect the\nrelative number of registered voters of each county.’” See id.\n“Periodically, names are drawn from the master wheels ‘in an amount sufficient to meet |\nthe anticipated demands for jurors for the next six months.” Jd. (quoting Jury Pian). Those who\nare drawn from the master wheels are sent jury questionnaires,’ which determine whether a\nperson is qualified to serve on a jury. Id. Jurors who meet the qualification requirements are\nthen placed in the respective qualified wheels for Manhatan and White Plains. /d. Finally, as\nThe Jury Plan bases its qualification criteria on neutral standards such as the ability to speak\nEnglish, citizenship and age, mental capacity, and criminal record. (See Gov’t Opp. Br. at 5.)\nMoreover, certain individuals are exempted from jury service by virtue of their professional\noccupations. (See id.) Finally, the Jury Plan also provides a carve-out for individuals who can\ndemonstrate “undue hardship or extreme inconvenience” on a case-by-case basis. (See id.)\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002830.jpg": "CaGadse2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRTaiehd FieebdR22e/? l Pafageod 2H 2o |\ncircuit have defined the relevant jury pool with reference to “the systematic defect identified by\nthe defendant.” Rioux, F. Supp. at l565-66; see Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *5 (defining jury pool :\nas both “the White Plains master wheel and the White Plains qualified wheel” because the :\ndefendants’ allegations impacted both venires). Under that approach, the jury venire that bears |\nthe brunt of the defendant’s allegations of systematic exclusion is determined to be the relevant |\njury pool. See Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, *5; Rioux, F. Supp. at l565-66. Here, Schuite’s | |\nallegations of systematic exclusion center almost entirely on the juror selection procedures for ,\nthe White Plains master wheel.* See infra l5-l7. Accordingly, the appropriate venire is the :\nWhite Plains master wheel.\ni. Relevant Community :\nThe most significant point of dispute between the parties is which counties constitute the\nrelevant community. According to Schulte, the relevant community must be the counties that\nfeed jurors to Manhatan because that is where his trial will be held. (Schulte Br. at 8; Schulte :\nReply at 3-5, ECF 454.) But the Government responds that the northern counties from which\nWhite Plains draws jurors represent the relevant community. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 9-l4, l8.) The\nCourt agrees with the Government.\nAs a preliminary mater, it should be noted that the Southern District is not statutorily\ndivided into discrete divisions. See 28 U.S.C. § ll2. Rather, the statutory law prescribes one\nDistrict that is composed of the follouing counties: Bronx, Dutchess, New York, Orange,\nPutnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id. Yet, what the statutory law leaves\n4 For example, if Schulte had alleged that the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> form displayed systematic\nexclusion, see supra 4n. l, then the qualified wheel would be the appropriate jury venire for\ncomparison. Because he does not do that, the master wheel must be the relevant venire.\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo283o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002837.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafads 66 26 2o\nproceeded this way was because of an external force: the COVID-l9 pandemic and its |\nsubstantial curtailment of in-person proceedings throughout the District. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658.\nThis allegation therefore does not establish systematic exclusion. !\nSecond, Schulte argues that the Jury Plan’s replenishment of the master wheels only once |\nevery four years constitutes systematic exclusion. (Schulte Br. at l4.) According to Schulte, the\nfour-year period causes addresses to grou “stale” as people move to new residences, and because\nAfrican Americans and Hispanic Americans are, on average, younger and thus more likely to :\nmove, he argues that these groups are systematically excluded. (See id. l4-l5.) But even\ngranting the dubious premises that make up this deductive reasoning, the Court remains ,\nunpersuaded because, again, the true cause of the exclusion—younger people moving more |\noften—is an external force, not a systematic defect inherent in the Jury Plan. Rioux, 97 F.3d at )\n658 (concluding that a jury system that led to undeliverable questionnaires did not constitute ,\nsystematic exclusion}. At botom, the Court cannot charge the District’s Jury Plan with a Sixth\nAmendment violation because of hou often people move residences throughout the District.\nThird, Schulte asserts that the Jury Plan’s exclusive reliance on voter registration lists\nconstitutes systematic exclusion. This claim, houever, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s\ndecision in Schanbarger. See 77 F.3d at l424 (“{A] jury venire drawn from voter registration\nlists violates neither the Sixth Amendment's fair cross-section requirement nor the Fifth\nAmendment’s guarantee of Equal protection.”).\nFinally, Schulte alleges that the exclusion of “inactive voters” in certain counties within\nWhite Plains constitutes systematic exclusion because African Americans and Hispanic\nAmericans are more likely to be inactive voters. (Schulte Br. at l5.) But again, the cause of the\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2837\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl99 Filed o4/o9/2l Page4of8\nPage 4\n\nSecond, the Government does not expect the S2 Indictment to have a significant effect on\nthe overall length of the trial, because the Government remains commited to a streamlined\npresentation of evidence that primarily focuses on the experiences of the specific minor victims\nreferenced in the indictment. While the Government expects to call a number of additional\nwitnesses as a result of the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment, including, of course,\nMinor Victim-4, the Government’s overall estimation of the trial length has not significantly\nchanged. In particular, at the July l4, 2o2o conference, the Government estimated that “its case\nin chief would take no more than two weeks,” but “propose[d] blocking three weeks for trial” in\ntotal. (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at 2o). Given the need to call additional witnesses, the Government nou\nestimates that its case-in-chief will nou take up to three weeks.” Accordingly, the Government\nwould propose reserving four weeks for trial in this mater.\n\nThe Government further proposes that if the length of the trial is of concern, the Court may\nwish to conduct jury selection during the week of July 6, 2o2l and/or make use of a jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, so that a jury can be seated and the trial can proceed immediately on July l2, 2o2l.\nSuch practices have been adopted in this District for other high-profile cases where jury selection\nis expected to take longer than usual. See, e.g., United States v. Skelos, l5 Cr. 3l7 (KMW) (making\nuse of jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> provided to venire approximately one week in advance of trial to\nstreamline jury selection); United States v. Percoco, l6 Cr. 776 (VEC) (same).\n\nThird, the Government has taken and will continue to take multiple steps to ensure that the\n> These estimates assume the defendant will agree to standard stipulations obviating the need for\ncustodians of records and similar witnesses. Should she not, the length of the trial may be\nsomewhat longer, although that of course would have been true even absent the obtaining of a\nsuperseding indictment. In addition, while the Government has tried to account for anticipated\ncross-examinations in its estimates, the length and scope of cross-examination is obviously not\nwithin the Government’s control.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo29l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002930.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 6 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

I also was asked to comment\non the appropriateness and accuracy of the defendant’s expert Jeffery Martin’s assessment of the\ndifference between the qualified jury wheel and the community.\n\nWW. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n3. The African American percentage of the White Plains qualified jury wheel was 3.69\npercentage points louer than that in the White Plains community (8.76% versus l2.45%,\nrespectively) and the Hispanic percentage was 3.64 percentage points louer than that in the\nWhite Plains community (lo.48% versus l4.l2%, respectively). This is consistent with what\nDefendant’s expert Mr. Martin reports in his declaration.\n\n4. The disparities were almost exclusively due to the patern of African Americans and\nHispanics having been sent a juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused at a significantly louer rate than other races or ethnicities after returning the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Of the 3.69 percentage point difference by race (African American), 2.58 (or\n69.9% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor. Of the 3.64 percentage point difference\nby ethnicity (Hispanic), 2.59% (or 7l.2% of the absolute disparity) is caused by this factor.\n\n5.

Thus, the decision to not draw a proper random sample accounts for o.68% of\nthe absolute disparity between the actual master jury wheel and a random sample master jury\nwheel for African Americans and o.82% of the absolute disparity for Hispanics.\n\n8. Based on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it is evident that the percentage of\nAfrican Americans and Hispanics of the actual White Plains master jury wheel is similar to the\nestimate of the percentage of African Americans and Hispanics in the White Plains community.\nThe percent African American of the master jury wheel is l.25 percentage points louer than that\nof the community, (l2.45% versus ll.2o%) and the percent Hispanics of the master jury wheel is\nl.l5 percentage points louer than that of the community (l4.l2% versus l2.97%).\n\n9. Mr. Martin notes that the disparity between the master jury wheel and the qualified\njury wheel is impacted by a clerical error in transcribing the individual’s mailing address. This\nclerical error affected every county except Westchester. Houever, the impact of this clerical\nerror on the absolute difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for\nthe African American percentage is negligible, and the error actually reduced the absolute\ndifference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for African Americans and\nHispanics.\n\nlo. In sum, as (l) the voter registration lists and the master jury wheel created from these\nlists reasonably mirror the representation of the community (an absolute disparity equal to or less\nthan l.25%), but (ll) because African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> used to determine if the potential juror was qualified, and/or (i) because African\nAmericans and Hispanics who responded were less likely to be found qualified, and/or\n(iv) because African Americans and Hispanics who were found qualified were more likely to be\nexcused, the absolute disparity between the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the White\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3625\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003628.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8 of 3o\nsystematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity. That\nis, if African Americans or Hispanics are less likely (or more likely) to register to vote, then the\nselection from the voter lists would be expected to underrepresent (or overrepresent) African\nAmericans and Hispanics to the extent that the likelihood of not registering to vote differs among\nthe demographic groups.\n\nl5. Since jurors are always anticipated to be needed for future trials, at least once a year,\npersons on the master jury wheel are selected for possible jury duty via simple random sampling.\nThose randomly selected are sent questionnaires to determine their qualifications to sit as a juror.\nThe names of persons who complete and return the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and are found to be qualified as\njurors are placed on the qualified jury wheel from which jurors are selected, unless they are\ngranted an exclusion from jury service.

Analyzing If There is a Difference in the Demographics of the White Plains\n\nQualified Jury Wheel and the Demographics of the White Plains Community.\n\nl6. The only statistic we actually knou that will allou us to assess the difference between\nthe demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the comparable demographics of\nthe White Plains community is the racial and ethnic make-up of the qualified jury wheel.\n\nl7. Based on the actual potential jurors’ responses concerning their race and ethnicity, the\nWhite Plains qualified jury wheel is 8.76% African American and lo.48% Hispanic.\n® Some small increase or decrease in the representation of African Americans and Hispanics\nwould be expected to occur by chance, but this is unlikely to have any meaningful impact of the\nabsolute disparity for African Americans and Hispanics.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3628\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 3o\nselected and those selected are sent a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to determine if they are qualified.

Belou is a list of all\nlikely possible causes of such a difference.

Reasons 4-5\nfocus on the causes of the differences between the actual master jury wheel and such a randomly\ndrawn master jury wheel. Reasons 6-8 focus on the causes of the differences between the\nqualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\nReasons:\n\nCommunity vs Randomly Selected Master Jury Wheel from Voter Registration Lists\n\nl) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because U.S.\n\ncitizens of voting age (i.e., the community) and those registered to vote (i.e., the master\n\njury wheel) are different.\n\n2) The estimate of the demographics of the community may differ from the demographics of\n\nthose on the voter registration lists because the estimates are from different times and also\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo363l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003632.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2 of 3o\nbecause the voter list demographics are as of a specific point in time, while the\ncommunity estimate is over a five-year period of time (2ol4-2ol8).\n\n3) The community may differ from the randomly selected master jury wheel because of\nchance in selection from the voter registration lists.\n\nRandomly Selected Master Jury Wheel vs Actual Master Jury Wheel\n\n4) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause the sample selection underweights the probability of selection from the counties\nfeeding both the White Plains and Manhatan master jury wheels. This is referred to as\nthe “prorating” issue.\n\n5) The actual master jury wheel may differ from a randomly drawn master jury wheel\nbecause, in five of the six counties, the voter registration lists did not include inactive\nvoters. This is referred to as the “sample frame” issue.\n\nQualified Jury Wheel vs Master Jury Wheel\n\n6) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because of clerical errors\nin transferring the mailing (alternative) address to the master jury wheel, which\npotentially results in not being able to properly reach some potential jurors on the master\njury wheel to determine if they should be placed on the qualified jury wheel.\n\n7) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel because being sent a\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, returning the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and being found to be qualified as a juror and\nnot excused are different by race or ethnicity.\n\n8) The qualified jury wheel may differ from the master jury wheel by chance resulting from\nthe random selection of those on the master jury wheel who will be sent a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3632\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003638.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 3o\nReasons 6, 7, and 8\n\n34. The last step in creating the qualified jury wheel is the selection from the master jury\nwheel of those deemed qualified and not excused. Reasons 6, 7 and/or 8 are the potential causes\nof any disparity between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.\n\n35. Focusing on the difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury\nwheel, one possible cause (reason 8) is that the qualified jury wheel differs from the master jury\nwheel because of chance in selecting persons from the voter registration lists to be sent a\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to determine if they are qualified and not excused and should therefore be moved\nto the qualified jury wheel. While possible, it is not expected that the demographics of those\nmailed a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will meaningly differ from those not mailed a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Any\nvariation should be random and equally likely to overrepresent or underrepresent any race or\nethnicity. Those mailed a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> are chosen by a simple random sample drawn from the\nmaster jury wheel. Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury\nwheel should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.\n\n36. Houever, some difference between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury\nwheel may be caused by the clerical error in transferring alternative mailing addresses to the\nmaster jury wheel (reason 6), which was noted by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin. Ifthe clerical\nerror disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics either positively or\nnegatively it could explain some of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\nmaster jury wheel. That is, the clerical error failure to pick up the zip code from the alternative\naddresses on the voter registration list likely prevented the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> from reaching those\nwho provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to\nrespond to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, but we do not knou if the error affected more African Americans\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l9 of 3o\nor Hispanics or fewer. Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African\nAmericans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> because they did not receive the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> due to this issue. I was able to\nidentify the persons on the master jury wheel whose <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was mailed to the incomplete\nalternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming\nthat, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the\nclerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the\nqualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, l,68l additional persons would have made it\nonto the qualified jury wheel, of which ll (or 6.6o%) would have been African American and\nl49 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase\nthe number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but louer the percent of persons on the\nqualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I\nestimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the\nqualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by o.l4 percentage points (from 8.76% up\n8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by\no.lo percentage points (from lo.48% doun to lo.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a\ncause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified\njury wheel and the community.\n\n37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and\nthe master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the\ncommunity, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003640.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o of 3o\nrandomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and/or\nthey are more likely to be found not qualified as a juror when they return the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nand/or they are more likely to be excused when found qualified, and, hence, African Americans\nand Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the qualified jury\nwheel (reason 7).

REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT\n\n39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury\nwheel and the estimated percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhatan, and\nthe overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then\ncompares the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White Plains\ncommunity, the Manhatan community, and the Southern District community.\n\n4o. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains qualified jury wheel\nand the White Plains community based on the 5-year 2ol8 ACS data, as I do. While I did not\ncompare the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the Manhatan and Southern District\ncommunity estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. Houever, since the\npercent African American and Hispanic in Manhatan and the Southern District are significantly\nlarger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by\ndesign the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury wheel will be significantly\ndemographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.\n\n4l. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random\nsample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,\ndue to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a\ndifferent selection rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on\nthe voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master\njury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who\nprovided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was\nthat voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\npresumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo364l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l4 _ Filed o4/l9/2l Pagellof3\nUSDC SDNY ee\nDOCUMENT |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ave vices: I9DT\nUnited States of America,\n_y-\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\n\nALISON J.

As a result, the Government expects that trial on\nthe non-perjury counts can be completed within approximately three to four weeks.!\n\nBecause the S2 Indictment was returned more than three months in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial date, the defense’s reliance on United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d 482, 486 (2d Cir.\nl985) to support its request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court\nordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superseding indictment that\nexpanded the scope of the charged conspiracy by an additional two years. That is plainly not the\ncase here, because the $2 Indictment was returned on March 29, 2o2l, more than three months\nbefore trial. Indeed, it is telling that the defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit has held\nthat a district court lacks the discretion to conduct a trial three months after a superseding\nindictment has been filed. Any such decision would be surprising, given that the Speedy Trial Act\nexpressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days from the filing date (and making\npublic) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.” l8\nU.S.C. §3l6l(c)(l). In other words, the defense has more than sufficient time to prepare for trial\nbetween the return of the S2 Indictment and July l2, 2o2l.\n' The defense misleadingly suggested in its April l5, 2o2l leter and again in its most recent leter\nthat the Government has doubled its trial estimate from two to four weeks. (See Dkt. No. 2o2 at\n7). As noted in its April 9, 2o2l leter, houever, the Government initially estimated that its case-\nin-chief would last approximately two weeks and suggested that the Court reserve three weeks in\ntotal for the trial, to include jury selection and the defense case. (See Dkt. No. l99 at 4). The\nGovernment has nou added only one week to that prediction, estimating that its case-in-chief may\nlast up to three weeks and proposing that the Court reserve four weeks in total for trial. Although\nthis prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the\nGovernment, of course, cannot be certain hou long such defense presentations will take during\ntrial. Moreover, given that the parties have consented to the use of jury questionnaires, the\nGovernment’s hope is that their use will expedite jury selection in order to preserve as many days\nas possible for the trial beginning on July l2, 2o2l.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004036.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 25o Filed o4/26/2l Pagelof3\n[USDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT |\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK t,o\nDATE FILED:_4/26/2l\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Court has scheduled three days for prospective jurors to complete the final\nCourt-approved <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and four days to conduct examination of prospective jurors.\n\nBut a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> by itself is not sufficient in this case to root out potential juror bias\nand to permit the atorneys to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges. Supplementing a\nrobust <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> with individual sequestered voir dire and limited examination of jurors by\ncounsel is necessary in this case because of the sensitive subject mater of the charges and two\ntypes of unfairly prejudicial media atention: (i) the pretrial publicity that this case has received\nand will continue to receive throughout the duration of the trial and (ll) the extensive prior\nnegative publicity concerning Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe intense negative media coverage of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein, most profoundly in\nthe aftermath of his death in August 2ol9 and the arrest of Ms. Maxwell in July 2o2o, has\nsignificantly increased the likelihood that prospective jurors will report to jury selection with\npreconceptions, impressions, and opinions about the conduct at issue in the trial and those\naccused of the charges in the indictment: Ms. Maxwell and Epstein An unprecedented amount of\nmedia coverage has focused on this case, Ms. Maxwell and Epstein. The publicity includes\nextensive coverage in the press, including newspapers, magazines, and on-line sites; in broadcast\nmedia, including regular and cable television stations, radio, and streaming platforms, such as\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005208.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page3ofl7\nNetflix, Peacock, and Amazon; in podcasts and YouTube recordings; in social media sites, such\nas Facebook, Instagram, Twiter; in online sites, chat rooms and blogs. The publicity has\ncovered a wide range of topics including and beyond those that will be presented at trial.\n\nProspective jurors may also have a strong reaction to the sensitive nature of the charges\nand some of the evidence that to be adduced at trial. Epstein’s arrests and prior conviction for\nsexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over the course of two\ndecades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and center during Ms.\nMaxwell’s upcoming trial.\n\nThe standard voir dire typically conducted by the Court is insufficient for this case and\nwill be redundant to questions posed in the proposed jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. A writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\ncoupled with sequestered voir dire of individual prospective jurors and limited open-ended\nquestioning by counsel will assist the Court and parties in determining whether prospective\njurors have developed prejudicial preconceptions regarding this case, Ms. Maxwell, and Epstein\ndue to this intense media coverage and pretrial publications and broadcasts.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page4ofl7\nARGUMENT\nI. THE APPLICABLE LAW\n\nA prospective juror may be excused for cause based on many forms of bias or partiality.\n\nAs the Second Circuit has explained, juror partiality can be actual, implied, or inferred:\n\nActual bias is “bias in fact,” generally evidenced by “express proof,”\n\nsuch as a juror’s admission to “a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s\n\ninterest.” Implied bias is “bias conclusively presumed as a mater of\n\nlaw” from circumstances in which an average person in the position\n\nof the prospective juror would be prejudiced. Inferred bias exists\n\n“when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality\n\nsufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion\n\nto excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory\n\na presumption of bias.”\nUnited States v. Quinones, 5ll F.3d 289, 3ol (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting United States v. Haynes,\n398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir. l968) and United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 45 (2d Cir. l997)).\nAll types of bias can properly form the basis to excuse a juror for cause. See id. Thus, the jury\nselection process should screen for each type. See id.\n\nVoir dire plays an important role in ensuring that juries are fair and impartial by allouing\nthe Court and parties to uncover unfair actual, implied, or inferred bias. It serves to protect the\nConstitutional right of a fair trial “by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the\npart of potential jurors.” United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). For these\nreasons, district courts routinely use their broad discretion to issue writen jury questionnaires in\nconducting voir dire, particularly in cases involving extensive pretrial publicity or hot-buton\nissues. See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, l3o S. Ct. 2896, 29l9 (2olo) (approving district\ncourt’s use of <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in trial of former Enron executive, Jeffrey Skilling); United States v.\nRobert Sylvester Kelly, l9 Cr. 286 (AMD) (EDNY) (“R. Kelly case”); United States v. Elizabeth\nHolmes, l8 Cr. 258 (EJD) (NDCA) (“Theranos case”); United States v.

See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3; see also United States v. Rahman,l89 F.3d 88, l22\n(2d Cir. l999). Using individual voir dire, in addition to a juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, is necessary in\nthis case (l) to expose potential biases by maximizing the likelihood that members of the venire\nwill respond honestly to questions, and (i) to avoid contaminating unbiased members of the\nvenire when other members disclose prior knouledge of prejudicial information or blurt out a\nprejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:\nIt may sometimes be necessary to question on voir dire prospective\njurors individually or in small groups, both to maximize the\nlikelihood that members of the venire will respond honestly to\nquestions conceming bias, and to avoid contaminating unbiased\nmembers of the venire when other members disclose prior\nknouledge of prejudicial information.\nNebraska Press Ass’n v.

A Tsunami of Pretrial Publicity About this Case\nCountless articles, books, podcasts, television shous, and docuseries from various\n\nsources have been published and broadcast concerning this case since it was filed in July 2o2o.\nThis folloued closely on the heels of an avalanche of media reports preceding and follouing\n\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 and follouing his death in August 2ol9. A tsunami of reporting in\nevery conceivable form — newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio, video streaming\n\nservices, podcasts, social media platforms — has broadcast this case locally, nationally, and\n\nglobally. Without a doubt, and without any credible evidentiary basis, Ms. Maxwell has been\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005213.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page8ofl7\ndounfall of other prominent New Yorkers due to sex scandals: former Governors David Paterson\nand Andrew Spitzer, former New York Atorney General Eric Schneiderman, former U.S.\nCongressman Andrew Wiener, not to mention the many New York-based television celebrities\nagainst whom serious allegations of sexual abuse have been alleged: Mat Lauer, Roger Ailes,\nBill O’Reilly.\n\nThe fact that a woman nou stands trial for charges almost exclusively alleged against\nmen heightens the interest and intrigue of this case. There are literally hundreds if not thousands\nof negative articles about Ms. Maxwell and Epstein in the very newspapers, television stations,\nand streaming platforms to which the jury pool in this case are regularly exposed (New York\nDaily News, New York Post, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, NY l, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox,\nNetflix, Peacock).\n\nThe jury pool from which the jury in this case will be selected has been exposed to more\nthan its fair share of media coverage fomenting public outrage at individuals accused of sex\ncrimes, like Ms. Maxwell. The negative publicity has been so pervasive, vitriolic, and extreme\nthat Ms. Maxwell has been demonized in the press. While the Court has no pouer to protect Ms.\nMaxwell from such public contempt, it can exercise its supervisory pouers and discretion and\nimplement protocols designed to obtain an open-minded jury sworn to return a verdict based\nsolely on evidence presented at trial.\n\nI. A ROBUST JURY <span class=\"highlight\">QUESTIONNAIRE</span> AND INDIVIDUAL VOIR DIRE ARE\n\nNECESSARY FOR THIS CASE\n\nA. A <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> Alone Is Insufficient to Uncover Potential Juror Bias\n\nIn cases like this—where there has been pervasive media exposure that inflames passions\nabout the underlying events and demonizes a party—prospective jurors can form biases long\nbefore they appear for jury service. Once a pretrial judgment is made, the concepts of “belief\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005214.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Page9ofl7\npersistence” and “confirmation bias” are at work. Belief persistence occurs when an opinion\nformed is resistant to change even when proven wrong. Confirmation bias occurs when an\nindividual forms an opinion early in the decision-making process and then evaluates new\ninformation in a way that supports the earlier decision.' The jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is the first\nopportunity jurors have to tell the lawyers and the Court what they are thinking and, more\nimportantly, what influenced them to think that way.\n\nGiven the likelihood intense media scrutiny of this trial, it is critical to use both a robust\nwriten jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and individual sequestered voir dire to inquire about the extent to\nwhich each potential juror has been exposed to pretrial publicity and to what extent each juror\nhas formed an opinion of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein\n\nBecause there is always the fear that a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the entire\njury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity, a jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and individual voir dire in a case such as this is particularly warranted. If the Court\nwere to engage in public questioning of the venire panel en masse, answers could infect the\nentire panel. Alternatively, concerns about a panel member’s unanticipated answer may render\nthe questions too carefully worded to uncover the problem. Further, questions asked pose privacy\nconcerns that would require constant side bars. A <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> can solve some, but not all, of\nthese issues.\n\nIndividual sequestered voir dire would encourage jurors to answer questions more\ncompletely and more honestly because the jurors would not be influenced by (or influence) the\nanswers given by fellou jurors or fear embarrassment in giving an honest response. Jurors avoid\nthe pressure to give “right” or socially acceptable answers in front of a large group or to parrot\n!

For example, in this case it is necessary\nto ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that\nmost jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media atention or\ninvolves a well-knoun defendant, a larger jury panel is often assembled in an atempt to increase\nthe odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even\nless inclined to speak up in front of a large group. Accordingly, in a high-publicity case such as\nthis, q <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> alone is insufficient.\n\nB. Individual Sequestered Voir Dire is Necessary Due to the Sensitive Nature\n\nof the Charges\n\nThe nature of the charges in this case poses special problems for jury selection rarely\nencountered in the average federal jury trial. The crimes charged (concerning sexual abuse of\nminors) are particularly inflammatory and of great concern to communities from which jurors are\ndrawn. The charges tap into strongly held moral, ethical, and religious beliefs concerning\nappropriate, inappropriate, and immoral behavior and conduct, and can produce visceral and\nemotional reactions leading to more severe judgments based on preconceived viewpoints rather\nthan on admissible evidence presented at trial As such, prospective jurors’ opinion and beliefs\nregarding the nature of the crimes charged will need to be addressed through procedures that\nmaximize juror openness, honesty, and candor.\n\nIt is only through in-depth questioning and exploration of jurors’ views on these issues\nthat both the defense and prosecution can uncover what is needed to pursue challenges for cause\nand to intelligently exercise peremptory challenges. The experiences and backgrounds of jurors\ncould have significant bearing on the potential biases that they have. A variety of potential\nexperiences, both general (e.g., being a victim of a crime or closely related to a victim) and\nspecific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo52l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 356 Filed lo/l8/2l Page l of l\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

(Dkt. 355.) The government’s response\nis standard SDNY operating procedure: “We don’t do that here.” Rarely is there an AUSA who\nhas ever conducted voir dire, so it is easy to just say “no.” In this case, counsel are beter\npositioned to address particular areas of case-related bias than is the Court, and requesting a mere\nminute per juror is far from onerous.\n\nThe proposed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> seeks highly sensitive and personal information regarding\neach juror. Simply asking jurors to raise their hand in response to an invitation to speak privately\non a personal topic is revealing and invasive. One would hope that the government would be\nsensitive to that fact and would want to ensure that a fair and impartial jury will be seated in this\nhigh-profile case. With each passing day, the amount of public exposure this case receives erodes\nthat possibility. Belou are today’s Google search results:\n\n= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,74o,ooo (about o.89 seconds)”\n« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,2oo,ooo results (o.86 seconds)”\n\nThe Court has the pouer and the obligation to ensure that jury selection eliminates jurors\nwho are biased and/or motivated to serve for reasons beyond being fair and impartial.\n\nThis is an extraordinary case involving sensitive issues. We urge the Court to exercise its\nsupervisory pouers and discretion and grant the defense request for individual sequestered voir\ndire and very limited counsel-conducted voir dire.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

(quoting ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 36o F.3d 9o, 98-99 (2d Cir.\n2oo4)). “The Second Circuit has explained that the party seeking to restrict press access bears a\n‘heavy’ burden.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 36o F.3d at lo6).\n\nHere, the defense manifestly fails to carry its “heavy burden.” /d. The defendant’s request\nto seal provides the Court with no basis on which to make the specific factual findings required to\nconceal voir dire, including the parties’ joint juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, from the public. Stewart, 36o\nF.3d at 98. In an effort to justify the defendant’s request, the Leter speculates that “media\ncoverage may prejudice the jury selection process.” Leter l.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\nie\nDOJ-OGR-oooo528l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 365 _ Filed lo/22/2l Page 23 of 4o\nJuror ID:\n4oa If no or unsure, please explain:\nla.\n| | NATURE OF CHARGES\n\n44-42 During the trial, you will hear evidence alleging sex crimes against underage girls.\nSome of the evidence in this case will involve sexually suggestive or sexually\nexplicit conduct.

Maxwell, 2ocr33o\nPreliminary Remarks Prior to <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>\nTo be video recorded and played on ll/4, ll/5, and ll/l2\n\nHello everyone. Thank you so much for being here. And welcome to the Southern\nDistrict of New York. My name is Judge Alison Nathan and I am the judge who will preside\nover the trial for which you have been summoned. I have recorded this message to you because\nyou are spread out in different rooms and over different times as part of the District’s COVID\nsafety protocols. I look forward to seeing you in person as this process moves forward.\n\nWe are about to start the process of selecting a jury to try a criminal case. I’m going to\nbriefly describe the process to you as it may be different than what some of you have previously\nexperienced when summoned for jury duty.\n\nThe first part of the process is going to occur nou. In a few minutes, after you’ve been\nsworn to tell the truth, you will fill out a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. The purpose of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is for\nyou to provide information to myself, to the prosecutors, to defense counsel, and to the defendant\nto assist all of us in determining whether you can be a fair and impartial juror in this case.\n\nWhen you are done filling out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, you will return it to the Jury Department\nstaff and you will be done for the day. Some of you will be asked to return for a phase two,\nwhich will involve in-person questioning by me. That is going to start on November l6. So you\nare free of jury service with respect to this case from whenever you finish the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> until\nat least November l6. Some of those who are going to return will come in on November l6,\nsome will come on November l7\", and possibly there will be one or two more days. You will\nget instructions before you leave here today about hou you will find out whether you are going\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo53l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005319.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 366 Filed lo/22/2l Page3of6\nto have to come back at all for the in-person questioning in this case and exactly what date and\ntime you would be obliged to be here.\n\nOnce that in-person questioning is completed, some of that group will be asked to return\nfor the last step in the jury selection, and some of that last group will be selected to serve on the\njury.\n\nThe trial in this case will begin on November 29 and we expect it to last approximately\nsix weeks. We will of course not sit on federal holidays, including Christmas Eve and Christmas\nand New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will explain the estimated\nschedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment.\n\nBut first, I want to tell you a litle bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal\ncase. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a\nformal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the\nGovernment’s burden at trial to establish a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThis case is brought by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nNew York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to\nengage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.\nMaxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must\nfind that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nNou, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press\ncoverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that\nis OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo53l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005320.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 366 Filed lo/22/2l Page4of6\nanything that has anything at all to do with this case or anyone involved in the case. You are not\nto discuss this case among yourselves, you are not to discuss it with anyone, including your\nfamily, friends, anyone. You may say that you are part of the jury selection process in a criminal\ncase in federal court, but that is all you may say. Moreover, you are not to do any research\nthrough any means about the case or anyone involved in it. That includes the defendant, it\nincludes the judge, it includes the lawyers, and it includes any other names you hear about today.\nAnd it means, among other things, that you are not to chater about it on Facebook, Twiter,\nInstagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, or any other social media services. You are not to read anything\nabout it online or in the paper. You are not to watch or listen to anything about it on television,\nthe radio, or on podcasts. You are not to do a Google search or any other kind of search. You\nmay not do any of that and that is very important. As I am sure you understand, we must ensure\nthat we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in this case based only on the evidence\nthat is presented in court during the trial.\n\nBecause this is a high-profile case AND because we are still in the age of COVID, I want\nto assure you that the Court will take a number of steps to protect your privacy and safety. First,\nwhen you are filling out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and as we go through the later stages of the process, I\nask that you please not identify yourself by your name or identify anyone you are associated with\nby name. Throughout the selection process and if you are selected as a juror, although the\nlawyers and I will knou your names, we will only refer to you in Court by your juror number.\nThis will protect your privacy.\n\nSecond, due to COVID and to ensure easy access into and out of the Courthouse, the\nCourt will arrange and provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the Courthouse\nevery day of trial.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo532o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005321.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 366 Filed lo/22/2l Page5of6\n\nAnd third, for those of you who are selected, we will provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks\nas well as places in the Courthouse where you can eat while maintaining adequate distance from\neach other while doing so. We also have all kinds of measures in place to assure safe distancing\nand air filtration in the Courtroom. And of course, everyone is required to wear masks.\n\nOk, I will end here with a few points about hou to fill out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and then I\nwill leave you to it. First, read all of the directions in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Second, please enter\nyour juror number on the front page of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and at the top of each page. Where\nindicated, please check the space for yes or no or unsure and, as requested, provide answers,\nexplanations or details on the lines provided.\n\nPlease answer every question. If you don’t understand a question, please write, I don’t\nunderstand. If you don’t knou the answer to a question, write I don’t knou. Please do not write\non the back of any page. There are pages at the end for extra space if you need it.\n\nPlease don’t leave the room while you are completing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. If you need to\nuse the restroom, please hand the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to one of the members of the Jury Department\nstaff, follou their directions, and retrieve it upon your return.\n\nPlease do not discuss the questions or your answers with anyone, including your fellou\nprospective jurors.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your service. Jury trials are part of the bedrock of\nAmerican democracy. Citizen jurors, not judges, decide the outcome of criminal and civil\ndisputes.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week.

I assume whatever\nl7 the reasons are it would apply to all. But I do want to hear,\nl8 and I need to hear very specifically, are you seeking\n\nl9 particular redactions, or what is the concern? And to the\n2o extent you have any authorities for the proposition that you\n2l seal proposed documents like this and the Court's draft in\n22 anticipation, I would certainly take that. But it's my\n23 understanding, and research indicates, that they are typically\n24 docketed. I've certainly always docketed them in the many\n25 cases I've tried. But let me hear specifically what the issue\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(Al2) 8oS-o2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006993.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 2l of 43 2l\nLalWmaxC\n\nl is, Ms. Sternheim.\n\n2 MS. STERNHEIM: OK. The documents, all four of\n\n3 them -- the two questionnaires, the parties' and the Court's,\n\n4 as well as the voir dire questions -- contain references to\n\n5 this case, names of participants. Any person who is summoned\n\n6 for jury service, they likely connect their summons with any\n\n7 press coverage there may be with regards to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n\n8 and the jury voir dire questions and this case.\n\n9 Until the prospective jurors complete their\n\nlo questionnaires, they may read coverage, search the media. They\nll are under no obligation or requirement to refrain from that,\n\nl2 and we're concerned that that will further have a diluting\n\nl3 effect on our ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. We\n\nl4 have no problem whatsoever at the moment the jury is sworn,\n\nl5 after peremptories have been exercised, that the Court place on\nl6 the public record all of those documents. This is a procedure\nl7 that we think can ensure a fair trial for both parties in light\nl8 of extraordinary media coverage in this case.\n\nl9 THE COURT: I need more specifics. You said\n2o references to this case, names of participants. The docket nou\n2l and going forward, as more filings come in, is going to contain\n22 names related to this case, names of participants. All of that\n23 information is part of the docket in this case, to be sure.\n24 That's No. l.

If you have a grade school math test and you get the\n\n4 questions in advance, you surely have some sort of advantage.\n\n5 To the extent we have a juror who has some awareness of the\n\n6 questionnaires because it's reported in the media in some way,\n7 they will have to truthfully tell us that in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n8 and the voir dire process.

STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I think this is an\n\nl3 extraordinary case, and there has been no ability for the Court\nl4 or the government and certainly not the defense to control any\nl5 of the vast media coverage in this case, which has\n\nl6 significantly prejudiced our client.\n\nl7 While things are placed on the public record, and\n\nl8 rightly so, this is a situation that is somewhat different.\n\nl9 Giving jurors the opportunity to view the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> before\n2o they come to court to fill it out is like a take-home exam and\nal they can fill out all the answers and do all the research and\n22 decide what answers they want to put on those papers.\n23 I think that there's an opportunity for people to be\n24 motivated to want to sit on this jury for a variety of reasons,\n25 some of which I have expressed in other filings that have been\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(Al2) 8oS-o2oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6994\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006995.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 459 _ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 23 of 43 23\nLalWmaxC\n\nl made public. I think in this case the Court has the\n\n2 supervisory pouer and the discretion to make sure that every\n\n3 protocol is put in place to ensure that a jury is seated that\n\n4 is fair and impartial.\n\n5 Perhaps I've been in too many cases where jurors have\n6 said one thing and many things they don't say, and you can ask\n7 as many questions as you want, but we have to rely on the\n\n8 candor of individuals who come to serve. I do not think that\n\n9 there is a great hardship or denial of the public's right to\n\nlo knou when the Court has just said that the press can be present\nll during the questioning, and that would be the day of the jurors\nl2 actually being in court. But I think to place the\n\nl3 <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and the voir dire questions on the public record\nl4 and have them reported in the press, a situation that the Court\nl5 cannot control, will have a very negative effect on both the\n\nl6 parties in this case, but most significantly on the party that\nl7 has been most damaged, that being Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl8 THE COURT: OK. Any authorities, any specific\n\nl9 authorities, and I mean examples of any other -- there are lots\n2o of significant high-profile cases that have occurred in this\n2l district and others. Any examples, and I don't presume any\n22 judge in such a case could control press coverage.

Pyramid Co.\nl8 of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The parties' sole\nl9 rationale for sealing the submission is to at a general level\n2o avoid media coverage that may prejudice the jury selection\nal process. The jurors are sworn to give true and complete\n22 answers to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire.\n23 I will be individually, one-on-one, questioning the\n24 jurors, and with the parties present, I feel confident that I\n25 can discern any clear dishonesty.

The <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire are\n\n5 designed to unearth that kind of prior exposure and any\n\n6 resulting potential bias.\n\n7 Nor is it clear what prejudice results from that\n\n8 possibility. As I said, I am not persuaded that in the off\n\n9 chance there's a juror who has the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> or a media\n\nlo reporter has the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in advance and fails to disclose\nll that, it's somehou prejudiced in their response to a question.\nl2 If a juror's going to lie and be dishonest, we will smoke that\nl3 out, and the fact of this <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> being publicly docketed\nl4 is not going to increase or decrease any such likelihood.\n\nl5 Moreover, as I said, the proposed exact questionnaires\nl6 are in my experience regularly docketed, including in\n\nl7 comparably high-profile cases. Again, in Judge Donnelly's case\nl8 just very recently, so similar nature of charges, similar\n\nl9 high-publicity media atention, in an age of social media and\n2o the like, she docketed the proposed her addressed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n2l in advance of jury selection, as I understand it.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—treferred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n-4-\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 462 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 23 of 32\nJuror ID:\nIf no or unsure, please explain:\n| | NATURE OF CHARGES\n\n42.

As\n22 I have indicated, we will begin trial on November 29.\n23 As I see it, the primary purpose of today's conference\n24 is largely to address the parties' motions in limine and then\n25 discuss some additional logistical issues.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document465- Filed ll/l5/2l Page lo6 of l27 lo6\nLBl5max4\n\nl hearsay grounds that I have already indicated I'm going to have\n2 the parties address further, correct?\n\n3 MR.

Thinking ahead again, just for time-saving\n2o purposes, what I propose is we do another video of that so that\n2l it is played for each panel -- there is a morning panel and\n22 afternoon panel. And the logistics of all of this is\n23 complicated.

I would like\n2 the parties, in Light of -- you have goten some rulings,\n\n3 obviously not everything yet -- to think about whether what we\n4 include in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is still the six-week time frame\niy that we have indicated. And if it is, it is, but if there is\n6 any basis to suggest a louer estimate as the parties have\n\n7 continued preparing their cases and in light of any rulings, I\n8 would certainly be open to hearing it if we could safely put a\n9 shorter time frame in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Again, maybe we\n\nlo can't. So I just ask you to think about it and confer and put\nll in a leter by November 2nd, on ECF, indicating whether the\n\nl2 parties agree that there should be any different estimate to\nl3 the trial length than what we have indicated in the current\n\nl4 draft of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. I recognize that may change after\nl5 that but for jury selection purposes it won't help us if a few\nl6 days later we decide that we could say four weeks instead of\nl7 six weeks. So you will let me knou and I will ask the parties\nl8 to confer. You don't need to put in specific reasons, just if\nl9 you can put in a joint submission as to the parties' best\n2o overall estimate of length of trial is to see if it can be\n2l realistically any shorter than what is in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to\n22 help facilitate jury selection.\n23 That's what I have.

While the Court instructed jurors that they were free to\ndiscuss their jury service with anyone of their choosing, some of the statements, as related in the\nmedia, merit atention by the Court.

There is no\nindication this Juror either needs a lawyer or is indigent and qualifies for court-appointed\ncounsel. Moreover, any such action would undermine the search for the truth and thus potentially\ncompromise Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury.\n\nMs. Maxwell intends to request a new trial under Rule 33 because the “interest of justice\nso requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a). Any submission will include all knoun undisputed remarks\nof the Juror, including recorded statements, the relevant <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and other non-\ncontroverted facts. It is clear to Ms. Maxwell that based on this record alone a new trial is\nrequired. If this Court disagrees, houever, Ms. Maxwell requests that a hearing be scheduled\n\n' The government cites United States v. Langford in support of its request for a hearing.\nDoc. 568, p 2. But the hearing in Langford concerned whether an honest answer from the juror\nwould have subjected her to a challenge for cause due to bias, i.e., the second prong of the\nMcDonough multi-part test. 9oo F.2d at 68-69. Given the substance of the juror’s dishonest\nanswer—that she had not been convicted of or arrested for any crimes when, in fact, she had\nbeen convicted of prostitution and arrested for larceny—her intent was relevant to whether she\nwas biased. An affirmative answer to the judge’s voir dire question did not, for that reason alone,\nrender the juror biased in a case involving controlled substances.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document575 Filed ol/l2/22 Pagelof2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ac\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED\n\nUnited States of America, .\n_y—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-oo33o (AJN) — Unsealing of\nDefendant’s Motion for a New Trial and Questionnaires of Seated\nJurors\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI write on behalf of The New York Times Company (“The Times”) to\nrequest that the Court unseal (a) Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial and\naccompanying brief and exhibits (Dkt. 58o) and (b) the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. These records are subject to\nboth First Amendment and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those redactions necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 38o F.3d 83, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page2of5\ninfluenced deliberations. See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page3of5\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First Amendment Right of Access\nAn independent First Amendment right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong). See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal. (“Press-Enterprise\nIT’), 478 U.S. l, 8-9 (l986); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. Once the right\nataches, it is overcome only by specific, on-the-record findings that\nsealing “is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8835\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Page4of5\nserve that interest” under the First Amendment. Bernstein, 8l4 F.3d at\nl43-45; see also Press-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4.\n\nDefendant's Motion for New Trial. Parties’ motions, briefs, and\naccompanying exhibits related to post-trial proceedings have regularly\nbeen found to be subject to the constitutional right of access, especially\nwhen they involve allegations of jury misconduct. See, e.g., United States\nv. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir. l994); United States v. Gonzalez, 927\nF. Supp. 768, 782 (D. Del. l996); see also CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for\nCent. Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First Amendment” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First Amendment right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d\n833, 84o (2d Cir. l994); United States v. McDade, 929 F. Supp. 8l5, 8l7\nn.4 (E.D. Pa. l996); In re Newsday, Inc., l59 A.D.2d 667, 669 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. l99o). As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer. The documents bear directly on not only “the manner in\nwhich criminal trials are conducted,” the aspect of government of highest\nconcern and importance, Richmond Newspaper, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S.\n555, 575 (l98o), but also specifically voir dire, a central component of a\ncriminal trial—both “to the adversaries [and] to the criminal justice\nsystem,” Press-Enter. Co. vy.

Dkt. 585.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Motion urges the Court to right a grievous wrong that deprived Ms. Maxwell of a\nfundamental constitutional right — her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury. Juror 5o’s\nresponses to the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and questions posed to him during in-person voir dire\ncorrupted the voir dire process and violated Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial. As set forth in the\nMotion, the defense believes that the existing record is clear and more than sufficient for the Court\nto grant Ms. Maxwell a new trial without the need for further factual development. Should the\nCourt agree with the defense, the Motion could be unsealed and publicly docketed at the same\ntime the Court issues its ruling with no additional delay.\n\n2o873o6.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8852\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008853.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document59o _ Filed o2/ol/22 Page2of9\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As previously discussed, unsealing the Motion\nwill give Juror 5o an improper preview of the defense’s position at any factual hearing the Court\nmay order, including the defense’s legal theories and arguments and our interpretation of the\nunderlying facts.

Cf In re Sealed Search Warrants Issued June 4 and 5,\n? Whether Juror 5o should be given access to his completed jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in advance of any hearing ordered by\nthe Court—and if so, hou far in advance—are questions that need not be resolved nou and should be considered\nseparately at a later time.

Factors to be considered vary and “include but are not\nlimited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy\ninterests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-\n5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nThe defendant states that the Defense Motion “is a ‘judicial document’ that is subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and the common law.” (Dkt. No.\n59o, Def. Leter at 4). The Government agrees. Houever, the defendant argues that the Court\nshould order the Defense Motion and its exhibits to remain temporarily sealed until the Court rules\non her motion or until the conclusion of any hearing ordered by the Court. (/d. at 9). The defendant\ncontends that such relief is warranted because public filing of the Defense Motion will “frustrate\nthe truth-seeking process of any factual inquiry ordered by the Court.” (/d. at 3). The Government\ndisagrees.\n\nThe defendant asserts that publicly docketing the Defense Motion “will give Juror 5o an\nimproper preview of information he does not have and should never have.” (/d. at 2). That concern\nis unfounded. The Defense Motion, as a general mater, contains discussion of some of the relevant\ncase law and information about statements reportedly made by Juror 5o in the news media. There\ncan be no need to hide from public view a discussion of public materials. Moreover, the defense’s\nsuggestion that her defense briefing contains information from some significant investigation into\nJuror 5o is not accurate; the motion does not contain any significant material that is not otherwise\npublic. Finally, to the extent the defense objects to unsealing Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which is\nan exhibit to their motion, that <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is a document that Juror 5o himself prepared, and\nwhich he would of course be shoun during any fact finding inquiry.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document594_ Filed o2/o4/22 Page4of5\nPage 4\nobviously will be reading the Defense Motion prior to any hearing. The defendant has cited no\ncase holding that a risk that witnesses will learn information about a case justifies the sealing of\npre-trial, let alone post-trial, briefing.!\n\nIn sum, Lugosch does not contemplate that cases or issues be litigated in secret until all\nfactfinding in a case is completed. Were that true, cases in this District would frequently be\nlitigated in secret until hearings or trials concluded. The relief sought by the defendant—sealing\nof a document with significant publicly available information—is not narrouly tailored and,\ntherefore, is inconsistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.\n\nThe Government additionally notes that the same arguments apply with equal force to the\nGovernment’s opposition brief, in which the only items marked for redaction are references to\nsealed portions of the voir dire transcripts and corresponding portions of the juror questionnaires.\nThese proposed redactions are narrouly tailored to protect the privacy interests of prospective\njurors and are consistent with Lugosch because, as the Court already ordered in sealing the\ntranscripts, they contain private information of those jurors. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior\nCt. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions to the Government’s opposition\nbrief.\n\n' The defendant’s atempt to equate its post-trial motion with a criminal investigation in which it\nserves as the prosecutor is meritless. This is not a criminal investigation, as this Court has already\nmade clear. See Dkt. No. 576 at 2 (noting that any inquiry is under the strict supervision and\ncontrol of the court). And the defendant’s conception of her role in these proceedings merely\nserves to highlight the Second Circuit’s concern about hou such inquiries have the “evil\nconsequences” of, among other things, “subjecting juries to harassment.” United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989).\n\n? While the defendant claims that it would be “too difficult or impractical” to redact the Defense\nMotion (Def. Leter at 8), the Government respectfully disagrees. Throughout the course of this\ncase, the parties have submited proposed redactions to hundreds of pages of briefing. The Defense\nMotion is not exceptional.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8896\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008900.jpg": "CaGade2N2o-o888GA2AEIJN DdooursenbSso Filed o2/o8/22 PRagd Db9ll\n\nCOHEN & GRESSER LLP New ek 2\n\nwwnw.cohengresser.com\n\nChristian R.

Juror 5o cites no authority to support\na juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he\ncites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access\nby the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.\nAlthough cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into\nallegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 5o does have, no cases support intervention.

Accordingly, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene.\n\nThe Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request to strike or seal the motion. The\nDefendant first requests that the Court strike Juror 5o’s motion, relying on the example of a civil\nforfeiture action and on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure l2(f). See Defense Motion, at 53 (citing\nUnited States v. All Right, Title & Int. in Prop., Appurtenances, & Improvements Knoun as 479\nTamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 (DLC), 2oll WL lo45o95, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. ll, 2oll)). Such authority is unpersuasive. Even in the civil context, “motions to strike are\ndisfavored and should not be granted ‘unless there is a strong reason for so doing.’” Bailey v.\nPataki, No. o8 Civ. 8563 (JSR), 2olo WL 234995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l9, 2olo). And Juror\n5o’s motion is certainly not “redundant, immaterial, impertinent or scandalous.” Broun v.\nMaxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5l-52 (2d Cir. 2ol9). Accordingly, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s\nrequest to strike the motion.\n\nThe Defendant alternatively requests that the Court seal Juror 5o’s motion until her\nmotion for a new trial is resolved. Defense Motion, at 54; see also Defense Ltr., Jan. l3, 2o22.\nThe three-part Lugosch test, as outlined above, compels denial of this request. First, Juror 5o’s\nmotion is a judicial document and accordingly subject to the presumption of access. It is clearly\n“relevant to the performance of a judicial function and useful in the judicial process.” United\nStates v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Whether this Court grants or denies the\nmotion does not alter this conclusion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the argument that\n“until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt at calling\nsomething a judicial document is premature”).

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nBy leter dated February l6, 2o22, the defendant proposed redactions to the parties’\nbriefing regarding Juror 5o. (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Government respectfully submits this leter in\nresponse to the defendant’s proposed redactions, which are overbroad and inconsistent with both\nthe public’s right of access to judicial documents and the Court’s February ll, 2o2l Order, which\npermited redactions of three narrou categories: (l) the questions the parties propose be asked at\nany hearing, (2) specific factual information developed by the parties which is not public, and (3)\nredactions to protect juror anonymity and privacy. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4).\n\nThe categories of redactions proposed by the defendant are impermissibly broad. In\nparticular:\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussion of the substance of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. For\nthe reasons set forth in the Government’s February 4, 2o2l and February ll, 2o2l leters\n\n(Dkt. Nos. 594, 598), the Government respectfully submits that Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n\nshould be made public, along with all other questionnaires of the twelve seated jurors in\n\nthis case. Indeed, the defendant has not opposed the New York Times Company’s motion\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o3 _ Filed o2/l6/22 Page 2of3\n\nPage 2\nfor public access to those questionnaires. Accordingly, it is not necessary to redact\ndiscussions of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> from the briefing.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about the statistical composition of the jury\npool. In particular, the defendant seeks to redact legal arguments about hou the Court\naddressed during jury selection the multiple prospective jurors who disclosed experiencing\nsexual abuse, assault, or harassment. These redactions are not contemplated by the Court’s\nOrder. While quotations or discussions of specific sealed juror materials may be redacted,\nthere is no basis to redact legal arguments about the jury pool as a whole.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[d]etails of investigative steps the defense has taken and\nevidence uncovered thus far.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). As an initial mater, the Government notes\nthe defense briefing contains very minimal non-public information. To the extent any of\nthe defendant’s proposed redactions address non-public materials, the Court has authorized\nsuch redactions.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact “[t]he defense’s view of the underlying facts.” (Dkt. No.\n6o2). But the Court expressly ordered that the parties should not redact legal arguments or\ndiscussions of publicly available facts, which is exactly what the defendant nou proposes\nto do. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4). The Court has already ruled that these proposed redactions are\nnot narrouly tailored.\n\ne The defendant seeks to redact discussions of her “requested discovery in advance of the\nhearing.” (Dkt. No. 6o2). The Court did not authorize this category of redactions.\nMoreover, the defendant does not offer any justification for her request, and the\nGovernment sees none.\n\nIn addition, the Government notes that the defendant has proposed redactions to portions\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008969.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o4 _ Filed o2/l7/22 Page4of6\nthat create teachings moments about the importance of safeguarding rights that not only affect\nnotorious and unpopular defendants but potentially affect the rest of us as well. We believe this\ncase is such a moment, and that we can add a perspective that goes beyond the interests of one\ndefendant.\n\n8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach folloued by this Court in this\nhigh-profile case of using a juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and follouing up with voir dire can be highly\neffective. See Skilling v. United States, 56l U.S. 358, 384 (2olo) (“Although the widespread\ncommunity impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors’\nconnections to Enron, the extensive screening <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and follou up voir dire were well\nsuited to that task.”) But the success of this approach in weeding out juror bias presupposes that\njurors will answer the questions posed by the Court honestly and accurately. Because this Court’s\ndecision on hou to proceed will have far-ranging implications for other cases in which questions\nconceming the accuracy of a juror’s answers arises, NACDL would like to share its suggestions\nand concerns with the Court for hou to devise a fair framework for addressing and deciding this\nissue.\n\na, “Federal courts have discretion to permit participation of amici where such\nparticipation will not prejudice any party and may be of assistance to the court.” Strougo v.\nScudder, Stevens & Clark, Inc., l997 WL 473566 (S.D.N.Y.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\nintervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page5ofl3\n\nIntervention in this action by Juror 5o would not prejudice either party to this action. If\ngranted, intervention would also not delay resolution of the issue subject to a possible inquiry, on\nthe merits.\n\nFor these reasons and those further set forth belou, the technical requirements for\nintervention are satisfied here. Additionally, the principles of justice, fairness and common-sense\nweigh strongly in favor of allouing Juror 5o to intervene. As such, Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene and for the release of the sealed Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> and voir dire materials should be\ngranted, as requested herein\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nJuror 5o served on the jury in the case sub judice, which reached a verdict on December\n29, 2o2l. After the verdict was reached Juror 5o gave interviews, which were reported in both\nprint media and televised news reports. In the media reporting on the interviews given by Juror\n5o, he is alleged to have discussed his personal experience(s) with sexual abuse. See Prosecution\nLeter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF # 568.\n\nOn this basis, and on the basis of information filed under seal, Defense Counsel sent a\nleter to Judge Nathan, which was also published in the media, claiming “incontrovertible\ngrounds for a new trial under rule 33”. See Defense Leter dated Jan. 5, 2o22. ECF #569.\n\nThereafter, Judge Nathan issued an order giving Juror 5o the opportunity to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” and to submit a brief by\nJanuary 26, 2o22, if he determines that he does desire to be heard on such issue. Order at l. Jan.\n5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o.\n\nJuror 5o seeks a copy of his Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>, as he does not recall answering questions\nregarding his prior experience with sexual assault. Juror 5o indicated the same to the media,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008985.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6o9 Filed o2/24/22 Page6ofl3\nwhen questioned about his answers to the Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>; therefore Juror 5o has a\ncompelling need to be able to separately confirm his recollection—regardless of whether or not\nthere may exist a lapse in such recollection—and to be fully prepared to explain himself, as may\nbe necessary, pursuant to an inquiry directed by the order of this Court. Juror 5o further desires\nto maintain his privacy and, to the extent possible, avoid having to disclose intimate details of his\nexperience as the victim of prior sexual assault.\nTW. ARGUMENT\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should, in its proper exercise of discretion,\nallou Juror 5o to intervene in this action and grant release, under seal, of a copy of his Jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> to his atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\nThe relevant precedent from case law makes it abundantly clear that jurors have\ncompelling and legitimate rights to privacy regarding “intensely personal subjects,” including\nprior sexual assaults. Juror 5o’s right to privacy is clearly implicated by an inquiry by and before\nthis Court, as the same relates directly and specifically claims concerning his experience(s) as a\nsurvivor of past sexual abuse and discussions he may have had with other jurors, in which he is\nalleged to have detailed his history as a victim of prior sexual assault. These factors are\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny surrounding the instant case and the already significant\npress coverage of Juror 5o himself, including the statements that he has made to the media about\nhis jury service.\n\nJudge Nathan specifically invited Juror 5o to address the “appropriateness of an inquiry”\ninto his conduct as a juror and affect that his personal history may have had on juror\ndeliberations and the verdict rendered in this mater. Order at l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-\n33o.Therefore, by allouing Juror 5o to intervene in this action, this Court can ensure that Juror\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8985\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008987.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Page8ofl3\nF3d 76, 79 (2d Cir l998) (Citing United States v.

Intervention in criminal trials may be granted to protect the\nrights of third parties\nIt is indisputable that precedent supports interventions by interested third parties in\ncriminal maters, as such have been repeatedly granted in “circumstances where ‘a third party’s\nconstitutional or other federal rights are implicated by the resolution of a particular motion,\nrequest, or other issue during the course of a criminal case.’” United States v.

For example, courts have alloued\nthe press to intervene in criminal cases to assert the First Amendment rights of the Press. See Jn\nre Associated Press, l62 F.3d 5o3, 5o6- 5o7 (7th Cir. l998).

Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\n\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order.

The government objected to Ms. Maxwell’s proposed questions. Jd. The Court\npartially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential\njurors had been actual victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.\n\nSpecifically, Question 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\n\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts’—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\n\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\n\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\n\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\n\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\n\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\n\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\n\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\n\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage |\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four |\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\n\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\n\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\n\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. |\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\n\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\n\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l3-l Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 3o\nJuror ID: ‘a QO\nAla.

Juror 5o’s\nfalse answers undermined the voir dire process this and other courts follou, including reliance on\nwriten questionnaires, to screen for jurors who, due to their prior experiences, cannot be trusted\nto be fair in the individual case. What happened here is a structural error: “a defendant is ‘entitled\nto be tried by l2, not 9 or even lo, impartial and unprejudiced jurors.’” United States v. Martinez-\nSalazar, 528 U.S. 3o4, 3l6-l7 (2ooo) (quoting Parker v. Gladden, 385 U.S. 363, 366 (l966)).\n\nI. THIS COURT SHOULD VIGOROUSLY PROTECT DEFENDANTS’ RIGHT TO\nAN IMPARTIAL JURY, PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-PROFILE AND\nSENSATIONAL TRIALS\nThe issue arising in this case reflects a broader problem. The Sixth Amendment explicitly\n\nsecures criminal defendants the right to trial “by an impartial jury,” but delivering upon that\n\npromise has groun increasingly difficult in high-profile and sensational trials. “The prime\nsafeguard is voir dire,” Fields v. Broun, 5o3 F.3d 755, 772 (9th Cir. 2oo7), in which “[t]he\nnecessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose ls obvious,”\n\nMcDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 554 (l984) (plurality).\n\nHonesty is the heart of the jury-selection process in an adversarial system; indeed, “voir\ndire” means “to speak the truth.” The whole point of the voir dire process is to elicit\ninformation from the venire that may shed light on bias, prejudice, interest in the outcome,\ncompetence, and the like so that counsel and the parties may exercise their judgment\nabout whom to seat and whom to challenge.\n\nFields, 5o3 F.3d at 772. Just as judges must recuse themselves to protect the appearance of\n\nimpartiality, see Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 886 (2oo9), judges must\n\nensure that jurors, as judges of the facts, are also impartial in appearance as well as in reality.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9llo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5ofl2\nto profit by writing books.* This has given rise to the so-called “stealth juror” who deliberately\nlies or evades full disclosure of bias to get on a jury. In the O.J. Simpson trial, for example, five\njurors were dismissed for misstatements during voir dire, including “[o]ne juror [who] failed to\nreveal that she had been a victim of spousal abuse, despite alleging six years earlier that her\nhusband had shoved her and forced her to have sex.’”*\n\nThe trial of a person accused of a heinous or notorious crime places great pressure on jurors\nto convict to achieve personal acclaim for convicting a despised defendant or to avoid scorn for an\nacquital. Here, for example, Juror 5o’s social media posts expressed appreciation for the\nstatements of gratitude he received for bravely telling his personal story of abuse and convicting\nMs. Maxwell. With so many advocacy groups demanding that victim witnesses be “believed,”\njurors may fear condemnation, or worse, if they acquit. Follouing the acquital of the officers who\nbeat Rodney King, for example, riots took place in Los Angeles and jurors received death threats.°\n\nTo counter the heightened concern with juror bias in high-profile, sensational trials,\nNACDL believes that courts must vigorously protect the integrity of this process on the front end,\nthrough questionnaires and extensive voir dire, and on the back end by refusing to allou a\nconviction where a juror, by his false answers to core questions relating to his ability to be fair,\nhas impaired the Court’s ability to exclude biased jurors from the panel.\n> See, e.g., Believing In The Truth (2ol2) (book by juror in trial of polo mogul John Goodman);\nHung Jury: The Diary Of A Menendez Juror (2ol8); We, The Jury: Deciding The Scot Peterson\nCase (2oo7) (book writen by seven of Scot Peterson’s jurors); Madame Foreman: A Rush To\nJudgment (l996) (book by three O.J. Simpson jurors, with interviews with five additional jurors);\nThe Private Diary Of An O.J. Juror: Behind The Scenes Of The Trial Of The Century (l995).

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l23\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009124.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l24\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009127.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5 Filed o2/24/22 Page8of 49\na\na\n\nFifty-eight jurors were qualified at the conclusion of voir dire on November l8, 2o2l. Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l27\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009128.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page9of49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that might make it difficult for him to be fair and impartial.\nSee Def. Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009129.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagelo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 qualified prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009130.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellof 49\nservice. According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nasking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion. The\nlengthier video is viewable at htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html.\n> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 5o’s public\nstatements excludes any reference to statements that Juror 5o made about what “occurred during\nthe jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The defendant’s brief, in an apparent\natempt to shou bias or prejudice, contains a recitation of certain of Juror 5o’s statements about\nwhat happened during deliberations. (See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel7 of 49\nShaoul. Thus, in the Second Circuit,’ it is a “threshold requirement” to establish that a juror\nintentionally lied or consciously deceived the court. See Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5; Nix, 275 F. Supp.\n3d at 437; Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 72 (“The failure to answer honestly must be deliberate; a\n‘juror’s good faith failure to respond, though mistaken, [does] not satisfy even the first prong of\nthe test.’” (quoting Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5)); United States v. Ruggiero, No. 97 Civ. 2925 (HB),\n2ool WL 28675l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2ool) (rejecting claim of juror misconduct in voir\ndire, concluding “it is not clear that [the juror’s] failure to respond to the Court’s question was a\ndeliberate atempt at dishonesty, as she only failed to answer the court’s question.”); Perez v.\nManhatan Jeep Eagle, No. 92 Civ. 952l (DLC), l997 WL 4o3458, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July l7, l997)\n(“[T]he first prong of the test requires a determination of whether juror number one deliberately\nlied to the Court during voir dire, or whether his answer was the result of a good faith\nmisunderstanding of the question.”).\n\nIn sum, to satisfy the first prong of the governing test, the defendant must establish\ndishonesty by Juror 5o—a deliberate falsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake.\n\nb. The Current Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate\nFalsehood\n\nOn the current record, there is no basis for the Court to find that Juror 5o gave any\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. To be sure, if his public statements regarding being a\nvictim of sexual abuse were truthful,!° it would appear that Juror 5o answered Question 48\n? While some circuits have reached a different result, the Second Circuit’s view appears to be the\nprevailing one. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Greene, l5o F.3d 357, 364 n.3 (4th Cir. l998) (collecting\nae 4 of course possible that Juror 5o’s unsworn public statements were not truthful, while his\nsworn answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> were. This is a threshold fact that must be determined at a\nhearing. But for purposes of discussion in this brief, the Government assumes that Juror 5o’s\npublic statements on this subject were truthful.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l36\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009138.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion Sn\na is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. LF\nPO he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9l38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009140.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 2l of 49\nee\nas\nee\nee\nee\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunswom public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part II, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\nso\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 4o (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Moten,\n582 F.2d at 666); see also Miller v. United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, harassment of jurors, and increased incidence of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . reasonable grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. LC\nee\na ee\nere\neee\nee\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 38 of 49\nnot have questioned Juror 5o during voir dire about his views about Dr. Loftus or memory, and it\nwould be inappropriate to do so nou.\n\nInstead, the inquiry of Juror 5o should be similar to the inquiry the Court conducted of\nother prospective jurors who answered “yes” to Question 48 of the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the prospective juror to a blank\nversion of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise. (Def.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to intervene and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto intervene, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009164.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 45 of 49\ninto the subject, by allouing [him] an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant\nissues.” (/d. at 7).\n\nIn his motion, Juror 5o’s counsel requested a copy of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, as well as\nthe transcript of his testimony during voir dire. (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “discovery request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> as a\n“discovery request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking discovery.!® He is asking\nfor access to his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous circumstances.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt. No. 585).\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions.

The evidence elicited should be the product of all available investigation and research.\nIn Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 976 (9th Cir. l998), cited favorably by the government,\nJudge Kozinski explained the perils of a court conducting a juror bias inquiry with incomplete\ninformation or failing to ask critical questions. \"[A] judge investigating juror bias must find\nfacts, not make assumptions . . . [I]t was the trial court’s obligation to develop the relevant facts\non the record, not merely presume them. The judge’s lack of verve in pursuing the mater casts\ndoubt on his findings.” /d. at 976-77. The Ninth Circuit en banc opinion also was critical of the\ntrial judge’s refusal to allou the defense to subpoena a critical witness of the bias. \"Where juror\nmisconduct or bias is credibly alleged, the trial judge cannot wait for defense counsel to spoon\nfeed him every bit of information which would make out a case of juror bias; rather, the judge\nhas an independent responsibility to satisfy himself that the allegation of bias is unfounded.\" /d.\nat 978.\n\nIf the Court is charged with the responsibility questioning Juror No. 5o, what resources\nwill the Court use to uncover any statements and misstatements made by Juror No. 5o? Will the\nCourt investigate Juror No. 5o’s motives? Will the Court hire an investigator to find all of the\nposts made by Juror No. 5o about the trial? Having witnessed Juror No. 5o during the trial and\nhaving previously questioned Juror No. 5o -- both through a writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and in person -\n- under the government’s farcical hearing the Court would be a (l) witness, (2) inquisitor, (3)\nfactfinder and (4) sole decision maker. These multiple, conflicted, roles are no model of due\nprocess.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l6- Filed o2/24/22 Page 3o of 32\nOO —CSCSC‘C‘ises\ni —“SCSCSCSCisies\nOO —SSCi\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> at that time. But balanced against\nMs. Maxwell’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury and this Court’s unflagging duty to\ninvestigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 5o’s request for the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> nou pales in\ncomparison.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet there be no doubt. The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

The New York Rules of Professional Conduct (hereafter “New York Rules”) specifically\nidentify when a lawyer is obligated to disclose information to the Court. The New York Rules\nare incorporated in the local rules of this Court. See Southern District of New York Local Rule\nl.5(b)(5).\n7. Relevant here is New York Rule 3.3(a) and (b), which provides:\n\n(a) A lawyer shall not knouingly: (l) make a false statement of fact or law to a\n\ntribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l7 Filed o2/24/22 Page2of3\nv. Amodeo, 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995); see also S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232\n(2d Cir. 2ool) (noting that a “document which is presented to the court to invoke its pouers or\naffect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items merely passed between parties in\ndiscovery). The defendant’s leter previews her argument on the merits of Juror 5o’s motion to\nintervene, which the parties have not yet briefed, yet ignores that the motion is a judicial document\nwhether or not the Court ultimately grants the motion. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2l (rejecting the\nargument that “until a district court knous the disposition of the underlying motion, any atempt\nat calling something a judicial document is premature”).\n\nThe defendant also argues that Juror 5o’s motion is not a judicial document because it is a\n“discovery request.” First, Juror 5o is not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of perjury, and which,\nnou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely to protect his oun\nprivacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464 U.S.\n5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials\nthemselves should be docketed, not whether a motion for discovery should be. The issue here is\nnot whether the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> should be docketed, but whether the motion should be.\n\nTurning to the balancing factors set forth in Lugosch, the defendant has identified no\nprivacy interest implicated by public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant\ncites the vague concern that potential witnesses at a hearing may learn Juror 5o’s views if the\nmotion is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will prejudice her. This argument has no\nmerit. The only substantive factual assertion in the motion is a brief statement that Juror 5o “does\nnot recall answering questions regarding his prior experience with sexual assault,” which, as the\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9538\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Pagelof2l\nDOCUMENT\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ELECTRONICALLY FILED ||\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DOC #:\nDATE FILED: 2/24/22\nUnited States of America,\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n~ OPINION & ORDER\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nDefendant.\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33, which the Government opposes. See Maxwell Br., Jan. l9, 2o22; Gov.\nBr., Feb. 2, 2o22. The Defendant seeks a new trial on the basis that Juror 5o “falsely answered a\nmaterial question during voir dire and . . . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been\nsubject to a challenge for cause.” Maxwell Br. at 48. The Defendant contends that the current\npaper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing. /d. In\nthe alternative the Defendant requests an evidentiary hearing to inquire into Juror 5o’s alleged\nnondisclosure. She also argues a broader hearing is required based on a news article that\nsuggests a second juror was allegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 49. The Government urges\nthis Court to deny the Defendant’s motion on the current record, but it consents to a limited\nhearing on the issue of whether Juror 5o provided a materially false answer to Question 48 of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Gov. Br. at 3l-32.\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the current record is DENIED.\nDefendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 5o\nregarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from considering\nunder Rule 6o6. With regard to Juror 5o’s statements that do not pertain to jury deliberations, in\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9542\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2of2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009544.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page3of2l\n\npress outlets about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater. Dkt. No. 568.\nThe leter noted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror\n“described being a victim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the juror\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at\nl. The Government indicated in a redacted footnote that it believed the juror to be Juror 5o, and\na review of his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> shoued that he had provided a negative response to a question that\nasked whether a prospective juror had been a victim of sexual abuse. Jd. at 2 n.2.! Finally, the\nGovernment requested that the Court offer court-appointed counsel to the juror in the event a\nhearing was ordered. A leter from the Defendant folloued shortly thereafter also informing the\nCourt about the juror’s interviews. Dkt. No. 569. The Defendant filed a second leter that same\nday opposing the Government’s request “because based on undisputed, publicly available\ninformation, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary hearing.” Dkt.\nNo. 57o.7\n\nThe Defendant filed a motion for a new trial on January l9, 2o22. The Government\nopposed the motion on February 2, 2o22, and the Defendant filed a reply in support on February\n9, 2o22. In addition to Juror 5o’s post-trial interviews, the Defendant’s motion relies on a New\nYork Times article reporting that “a second juror described in an interview . . . having been\n! The Government proposed redacting the footnote because the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was not a public document at that\ntime. Because (for the reasons explained belou) the Court nou unseals the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, that redaction is no longer\nnecessary.\n? For completeness of the record, the Court notes the follouing occurred also on January 5, 2o22: The Jury\nDepartment of the Southern District of New York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of\nstatements he had given to certain media outlets that were being widely reported on in the press and inquiring\nwhether he needed an atorney. At the Court’s direction, the District Executive returned Juror 5o’s call and\ninformed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question. Juror 5o then asked the\nDistrict Executive if he could access his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. The District Executive, again at the Court’s direction,\ninformed Juror 5o that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was not a public document and could not be provided to him.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9544\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page4of2l\nsexually abused as a child” as a basis for a broader hearing beyond inquiry into Juror 5o.\nMaxwell Br. at 2l, 49.\n\nII. Motion for a new trial on the current record\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the\n\ncourt may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” Fed.\nR. Crim. P. 33(a). The parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s\nalleged nondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer Equipment, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984). Maxwell Br. at 22-28; Gov. Br. at ll. In McDonough, the\nSupreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror nondisclosure during voir dire,\n‘‘a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir\ndire, and then further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also United States v. McCoy, 995 F.3d\n32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); United States v. Shaoul, 4l F.3d 8ll, 8l5-l6 (2d Cir. l994); United States\nv. Langford, 99o F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. l993).3\n\nThe McDonough inquiry is restricted by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which states:\n\nDuring an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n\ntestify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s\n\ndeliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or\n\nany juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court\n\nmay not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these\n\nmaters.\nFed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l).\n3 The parties dispute certain contours of the McDonough test, including whether it requires a deliberately false\nanswer. But at a minimum, the parties agree that the deliberateness of a juror’s incorrect answer is relevant to this\ninquiry. Maxwell Reply at l3-l4. Because, as explained belou, the Court does not nou resolve at this juncture\nwhether Juror 5o’s answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire merit a new trial, it need not and does not resolve\nthose disputes pre-hearing.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 62o _ Filed o2/25/22 Page/7of2l\ndeliberations.” Maxwell Reply Br. at 8. This argument is wrong, as “the ultimate purpose of the\n[requested] post-trial evidentiary hearing is to set aside a jury verdict.” Ventura, 2ol4 WL\n259655, at *3. And “there is no discernible reason to apply a different general standard to new\ntrial motions based on juror misconduct than to those premised on any other reason.” United\nStates v. Guzman Loera, No. o9-CR-o466 (BMC), 2ol9 WL 2869o8l, at *5 n.5 (E.D.N.Y. July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234. The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o - Filed o2/25/22 Page9of2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nId.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only l follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo955o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8 of 2l\nmust be “limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 544. The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications\nbetween Juror 5o and unknoun persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 5o’s answers\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire. Nor has the Defendant\nexplained why Juror 5o’s receipt of financial payment for interviews after the trial, if true, would\nbe probative of his inclination to not disclose at voir dire prior to trial. The Court will not grant\nthe Defendant “the opportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234\n(quoting Moten, 582 F.2d at 667).\n\nMoreover, the Defendant’s requested subpoenas directed at social media companies who\nhave custody of Juror 5o’s communications, comments, and posts are procedurally improper.\nThose requests for social media content are subject to the Stored Communications Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§§ 27ol-ll, which requires an additional factual shouing for the Court to order disclosure, see 2\nWayne LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure §§ 4.8(b), 4.8(d) (4th ed. 2o2l); Mater of Warrant to\nSearch a Certain E-Mail Acct. Controlled & Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 829 F.3d l97, 2o6\n(2d Cir. 2ol6), vacated and remanded on other grounds, l38 S. Ct. ll86 (2ol8). And only the\nGovernment, not private parties like the Defendant, may request disclosure pursuant to the Act.\nUnited States v. Nix, 25l F. Supp. 3d 555, 559 (W.D.N.Y. 2ol7) (“[T]he [SCA] does not permit\na defendant in a criminal case to subpoena the content of a Facebook or Instagram account.”);\nFacebook, Inc. v. Wint, l99 A.3d 625, 629 (D.C. 2ol9) (collecting cases). Though the\nGovernment raised the Act in its briefing, the Defendant does not acknouledge it or purport to\nshou she is entitled to make a request. Accordingly, the requests as to the listed social media\ncompanies are denied.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9559\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has not made a shouing that any pre-hearing\n\ndiscovery is appropriate, and the request to engage in an intrusive fishing expedition is denied.\nC. The Court will release Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n\nThis Court previously reserved ruling on Juror 5o’s request that the Court release his jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under seal to protect his\nsupposed privacy interest. See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.l. The Defendant opposes both the unsealing\nand releasing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will\nundoubt[edly] color Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture.” Maxwell Br. at 53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in\nlimiting Juror 5o’s access and opposes maintaining the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> under seal. Gov. Br. at 42;\nsee also Dkt. No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his completed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his completed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> must be docketed. Juror 5o’s and the Defendant’s request that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nremain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). See Dkt. No. 596 at 2 (outlining the\ntest). First, the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> easily qualifies as a judicial document.

For the reasons stated in this Court’s prior order, this\npresumption of access is not outweighed by the possibility of media interest in the document.\nSee Dkt. No. 596 at 3.

Dkt. 6lo.\nRenewed Request for Counsel to Conduct the Questioning of Juror 5o\nMs. Maxwell reiterates her request that the Court allou counsel to conduct the questioning\nof Juror 5o during the upcoming hearing. Atorney-conducted questioning enhances the\nopportunity and ability to elicit bias on the part of the juror. See, e.g., Johnson & Haney, Felony\nVoir Dire: An Exploratory Study of its Contents and Effect, l8 Law and Human Behavior 3o9\n(l994). To smoke out the reasons why Juror 5o did not truthfully answer Questions 48 and 25 on\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he must be cross-examined. Defense counsel is in the best position to\nconduct that cross-examination. This was the procedure that Judge Pauley folloued in United\nStates v. Daugerdas, and there is no reason to follou a different procedure here. See Dkt. 6l6-l.\n2loo689.3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9638\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009639.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page 2 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Questions to Determine the Nature of Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and Whether Juror\n5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> Were False\nUnder the McDonough test, the Court must first determine whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were, in fact, false as reflected in his post-trial statements to the media.\nUnited States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough Pouer Equipment,\nInc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)). It is also necessary for the Court to inquire about\nthe nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 5o experienced. Had Juror 5o disclosed in response to\nQuestion 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of\nthat abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is\nimportant for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 5o’s sexual abuse to determine hou\nsimilar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United\nStates v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (“Courts imply bias ‘when there\nare similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’”\n(quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)). Accordingly,\nthe defense requests that the Court ask Juror 5o the follouing questions:\nl. The Independent and the Daily Mail reported that you said you were the victim of\nsexual abuse when you were child, correct?\n2. Did you say that?\n3. So, itis accurate that you claim to have been a victim of sexual abuse when you were\nunder the age of consent?\n4. Hou old were you when you were sexually abused?\n2loo689.3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9639\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page5of22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that you filled out before you were selected to be a juror on this\ncase asked you the follouing question: “Have you or a friend or a family member ever\nbeen the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?”\na. That was Question 48?\nb. And it gave you the choice of marking “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend of family\nmember)” or “No”?\nc. And you marked “No”?\nd. Based on what you have just described about your oun experience of being\nsexually abused as a child, that answer is not true, correct?\n33. The jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> also asked you the follouing question: “Have you, or any of\nyour relatives or close friends, ever been the victim of a crime?”\na. That was Question 25?\nb. And it gave you the choice of marking “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend of family\nmember)” or “No”?\nc. And you marked “No”?\nd.

Questions to Probe the Reasons for Juror 5o’s Responses to the Questions on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> and the Credibility of His Explanations\nThe Court ruled that the scope of the hearing must include an inquiry into “the explanation\nfor [the] answers” that Juror 5o gave to the questions in the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. 2/24/2o22 Op. &\nOrder at 7.

Do you identify with them as people who had experienced the same type of\nabuse that you had experienced as a minor?\n4.

See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43\n(2d Cir. l997) (Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable bias, or actual bias).\nThe defense believes it serves no purpose to ask Juror 5o what he would have said if he had been\n2loo689.3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo965l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document636 Filed o3/ol/22 Page l8 of 22\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Do you agree with the follouing statement: “Based on my oun experience and without\nknouing the particular facts of any case, if someone claims that they were abused, it is\nmore likely that I will believe they are telling the truth”?\n\n9. Do you believe that people who make allegations of being sexually abused as a child\n\nare usually telling the truth?\n\nlo. Do you believe that victims would not go through the stress of testifying at trial about\n\nthe sexual abuse they suffered as a child unless they were telling the truth?\nD. Questions to Elicit Whether Juror 5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> Were Deliberately or Intentionally False\n\nThe Court did not resolve whether the standard for a new trial requires the prospective\njuror to make a deliberate false statement on the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> or whether an inadvertent\nmisstatement is sufficient as long as a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause. See 2/24/2o22 Op. & Order at 4n.3. The defense and the amici believe that\nthat a deliberate misstatement is not required.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is. not evidence. It simply contains the a\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends. to prove to the jury at trial a\nbeyond a reasonable doubt..\nee The charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the — ||\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to a\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of.a minor.\n/ The Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the |\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a ctiminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minots to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.

Jury Selection\nA. The jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n\nThis Court summoned about seven hundred potential jurors, providing each of\nthem with a 22-page <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> containing 5o questions. Groups of loo or more jurors\nwere gathered in the courthouse in morning and afternoon sessions over the course of\nthree days. They were given as much time as needed to complete the questionnaires.\nPotential jurors signed the questionnaires and swore to the accuracy of their responses\nunder penalty of perjury.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>’s purpose was to provide the parties with information about\npotential jurors and to discern whether any potential juror could not be fair and impartial.\nThe Court assured the parties that any affirmative answers to questions would be the\nsubject of follou up questioning during the oral voir dire.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 66\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> began with a summary of the indictment and the allegations\nagainst Ms. Maxwell, including allegations of sexual trafficking, enticement, and\ntransportation.\n\nGiven the accusations and the sensitivity of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment, and the pouerful effects such assault, abuse, and harassment can have, the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> included several questions designed to elicit whether a potential juror had\never been abused, assaulted, or harassed, and hou that might affect their ability to be an\nunbiased fact finder.\n\nFor example, Question No. l3 asked potential jurors if they could decide the case\npurely the evidence or lack of evidence and not based on any biases, sympathies, or\nprejudices.\n\nQuestion 25 asked potential jurors if they were ever a victim of a crime and, if so,\nwhether that experience would prevent them from being fair and impartial.\n\nQuestions 42-5o asked jurors about their feelings and experiences with the types\nof alleged conduct at issue in the case, including sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual\nharassment.\n\nQuestion 42 asked whether the nature of the allegations against Ms. Maxwell\n“might make it difficult” for potential jurors to be fair and impartial. Question 43 asked\npotential jurors if they had views about the laws concerning the age of consent and if\nthose views would affect their ability to be fair and impartial.

The defense proposed to ask potential jurors: (l) “Whether reported or not,\nhave you, any family member or anyone close to you, including a child/minor, ever been\nthe victim of any form of sexual abuse? (This includes actual or atempted sexual assault\nor other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member;” and (2) “Whether reported or not, have you, or anyone close\nto you, including a child/minor, ever felt in danger of being sexually assaulted by another\nperson, including a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member?” Doc.\n367, p 2l. The government objected to Ms. Maxwell’s proposed questions. Jd. The Court\npartially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential\njurors had been actual victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.\n\nSpecifically, Question 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or\n\natempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a\n\nstranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> offered three answers: “Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),”\nand “No.”\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page l2 of 66\n\nIf a potential juror selected either “yes” option, the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> asked individuals\nto explain their answer in writing, to state whether having been a victim of sexual assault,\nsexual abuse, or sexual harassment would affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially, and if so, to explain why.\n\nFinally, Question 5o asked potential jurors if there was any experience that they\nhad that might affect their ability to serve fairly and impartial as a juror.\n\nSix-hundred and ninety-four individuals answered the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nB.

According to Juror No. 5o, coming to a\nunanimous verdict “wasn’t easy, to be honest.” In fact, several jurors doubted the\ncredibility of Jane and Carolyn. “When I shared that [I had been sexually abused],”\nrecounted Juror No. 5o, the jurors who had doubts “were able to sort of come around on,\nthey were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse.”\n\n4.

Moreover, like\nthe juror in Ashfar, Juror No. 5o’s post-trial conduct further supports a finding of implied\nbias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual assault; here, Juror No.\n5o communicated with Annie Famer. The juror in Ashfar viewed himself as “advocate for\npeople;” here, Juror No. 5o proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a\nverdict “for all the victims.”\n\nThe bias of Juror No. 5o should be implied for another reason: “[R]epeated lies in\nvoir dire imply that the juror concealed material facts in order to secure a spot on the\nparticular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472. Here, not only did Juror No. 5o\nfalsely deny on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he had been a victim of a crime and a victim of\nsexual assault and sexual abuse, he also falsely answered the Court’s questions about\nsocial media. According to Juror No. 5o, he used only Facebook and Instagram and he\ndeleted all his social media accounts. In fact, Juror No. 5o was a Twiter user, having\njoined Twiter in April 2o2l.

Assuming this Court holds an evidentiary\nhearing at which Juror No. 5o is compelled to give truthful answers to the questions he\nwould have been asked if he had not falsely responded to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Ms. Maxwell\nreserves the right to argue that Juror No. 5o was actually biased.\n\nC. Juror No. 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 were intentionally false.\n\nMs. Maxwell does not need to prove that Juror No. 5o’s voir dire answers were\nintentionally false. As explained above, she need only prove “first, that the juror’s voir\ndire response was false and second, that the correct response would have provided a valid\nbasis for a challenge for cause.” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. Nevertheless, assuming this\nCourt concludes that Ms. Maxwell must prove Juror No. 5o intentionally misled the\nCourt in falsely answering Questions 25 and 48, Ms. Maxwell has easily met that burden.\n\nThere are at least six reasons to believe Juror No. 5o acted intentionally. First, this\nCourt need only watch the video of Juror No. 5o being confronted with his false answers\nto appreciate that he acted intentionally. Juror No. 5o’s face immediately flushed and\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 47 of 66\nturned red, and he grasped for words when the Daily Mail reporter told him about\nQuestion 48. “Interesting,” Juror No. 5o said, struggling for an explanation. Unable to\ncredibly explain away his false answer, Juror No. 5o eventually put together a\nnonsensical response: “No, No! I knou my face is red because I can feel the blood but, I\nhonestly—that’s why I answered it that way.”\n\nSecond, Juror No. 5o’s atempt to justify his false answer by claiming he “flew\nthrough” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is not worthy of belief. The <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> instructed potential\njurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would knou the identities\nof the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful\nanswers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an\nanswer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they\ncould alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 5o heeded these instructions.\nIndeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 5o carefully folloued these\ninstructions and did not “fly through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, as he nou claims. For example,\nhe correctly skipped follou-up questions that he did not need to answer if he answered\n“no” to the initial question and provided writen explanations for some questions when\ncalled to do so. Ex. l, p l7 (Question 34.a); p l8 (Question 37.a). Juror No. 5o also\ncertified, under the penalty of perjury, that his answers were “true and correct.” Ex. l, p\nts\n\nThird, it is simply not credible that Juror No. 5o would not recognize and then not\nremember that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> asked if he was a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse,\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 48 of 66\nor sexual harassment. Juror No. 5o said he did remember the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>’s asking\nwhether his family or friends had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual\nharassment. But as the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> itself explained and as this Court told Juror No. 5o\nduring his voir dire, the entire point of the process was to evaluate whether Juror No 5o\ncould be fair and impartial. Ex. l, p 3 (“The purpose of this <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is to determine\nwhether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence\npresented at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge.”). The\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> also told potential jurors that it would ask personal questions. /d.\n(“Although some of the questions may appear to be of a personal nature, please\nunderstand that the Court and the parties must learn enough information about each\njuror’s background and experience to select a fair and impartial jury.”’”). A personal\nexperience as a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment is far more\nrelevant to fairness and impartiality than a family member’s or friend’s experience with\nsuch assault, abuse, or harassment. Given the content of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and its obvious\npurpose, remembering a question about the later but not the former is simply not\ncredible.\n\nFourth, Juror No. 5o’s post-verdict conduct shous his false answers to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> were intentional. Juror No. 5o went on a media press to promote himself,\nhis experience as a victim, and his role on the jury.

The\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and the concept of fundamental fairness, houever, are the same\nregardless of which side of the Hudson the misstatements occurred. In a very close,\ncontested trial where the only real issue was the credibility of the accusers, the failure of\nJuror 5o to disclose his claimed victim status in jury selection cheated Ms. Maxwell of\nher ability to intelligently exercise her peremptory challenges and robbed her of a fair\ntrial. In this case truthful responses would have revealed Juror 5o’s claimed victim status.\nHe would have been excused for cause on that basis alone and would never answered any\nquestions in person.\n\nEven if Juror 5o had claimed on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he could be fair, despite his\nvictim status, the result would have been the same.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment\n\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts’—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\n\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\n\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\n\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\n\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\n\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\n\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\n\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\n\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage |\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four |\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\n\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\n\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\n\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. |\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before\n\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\n\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nadh:\nDOJ-OGR-oooo976l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009779.jpg": "Caedash: 22 OrCkkes i\nBAAN DmmwiesnitGi2-t AfitelGRs2ui772 Pate 2afaicso\nJuror ID: ‘a QO\nAla.

Ianniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543\n(2d Cir. l989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only\nwhat is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing\nshould be limited to questioning of Juror 5o by the Court, in order to determine: (l) whether he\ndeliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,\n(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had accurately responded to that\nquestion, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nBefore trial, the jury department for the Southern District of New York conducted five\nsessions over the course of November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l during which 694 jurors completed a\njuror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> approved by the Court. Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2:2o-2l. The juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nwas 29 pages and comprised of 5l questions, many of which contained subparts. The parties\nreviewed the completed questionnaires and then conferred, submiting a joint list delineating four\ncategories of prospective jurors: (l) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense\ncounsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and\ndefense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense\ncounsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)\nprospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or\nstruck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of l3 prospective\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page5of49\njurors—that were included on the list of jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire—\nthat the Court “thought should be considered for excusing.” /d. at 3:5-ll. While the Government\ndid not object to the Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the l3\nprospective jurors; those four proceeded to voir dire. Jd. at 3:l2-l6. On November l5, 2o2l, the\nCourt calculated that the parties had agreed that 23l of the 694 prospective jurors should proceed\nto voir dire, which the Court determined was a “sufficient number to get to the number of jurors\nthat we need.” /d. at 4:9-l3. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rule on whether to\nstrike the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated\nat the November l5 conference that it planned to qualify 5o to 6o of the 23l jurors after voir dire.\nId. at 4:l9-2o.\n\nOn November l6, 2o2l, the Court commenced the voir dire portion of the jury selection\nprocess. The Court asked prospective jurors several follou-up questions to questions in the jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> which prospective jurors had answered affirmatively, including, for example, the\nprospective jurors’ familiarity through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the\nprospective jurors’ history (or that of a friend or family member) of prior sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault; and the prospective jurors’ experience (or that of a relative or close friend)\n' The defendant is therefore incorrect when she asserts that “[t]he Court granted all 23 of the[]\nchallenges for cause made by the defense” that the Government did not agree with. (Def. Mem.\nat lo). Similarly misleading is the defendant’s statement that “the parties jointly agreed to excuse\n67 of the ll4 who answered ‘yes’ when asked if they had been a victim of sexual abuse, sexual\nassault, or sexual harassment.” (Def. Memo. at 9). That assertion fails to note that a significant\nnumber of those prospective jurors had stated that they could not be fair and impartial for a number\nof reasons, including their familiarity through the media with the defendant and Epstein; that the\nGovernment agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than their responses\nto Question 48; and that the Court did not ultimately rule on whether any of those jurors should be\nstruck for cause.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 6 of 49\nof being a victim of a crime. The Court asked the prospective jurors whether that information or\nthose experiences would interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the Court qualified 58 jurors. Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. Of\nthe 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question\n48 of the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:\n\ne Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative. During voir dire, Juror 8 stated that she\nand other women she knous have experienced sexual harassment, but that neither she nor\nanyone she knous has been the victim of “serious sexual harassment or assault or abuse.”\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8:l3-22. Neither the Government nor defense counsel challenged\nJuror 8 for cause.\n\ne Juror 2l wrote in response to Question 48 in her juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that\n\n. Juror 2l\nalso reported that a friend of hers was sexually harassed and coerced into a sexual\nrelationship with his professor. Juror 2l indicated that these experiences would not affect\nher ability to be fair and impartial?\n\nIn response to additional questioning, she explained that she had reported to her school\nthat her friend was “coerced into a sexual relationship with their professor, kind of\nblackmailed into it, and then paid off by the school to keep it quiet.” Jd. at 54:6-l2. She\nreiterated that this would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Jd. Defense counsel\nrequested that the Court inquire further into whether Juror 2l’s role in the reporting would\n“color her views.” Jd. at 56:8-ll. In response, the Court inquired whether Juror 2l’s ability\nto be fair and impartial would be affected “[t]o the extent there may be issues in the case\nthat arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse or\nharassment or the like,” to which Juror 2l responded no.

See,\ne.g., id. at2l6:l9-2l7:2. Neither the Government nor defense counsel challenged Juror 63\nfor cause.\n\ne Juror 93 wrote that\nDuring voir dire, ln response to questioning, Juror 93 said that she was sexually moleste\nby an uncle when she was l2 or l3, as was her sister and an aunt, but that would not affect\nher ability to be fair and impartial in the case and that the allegations in the case would not\nupset her in a way that would distract from her duty as a juror.

Nov.\nl8, 2o2l Tr. at 7l7. The Court agreed to ask the qualified jurors before the parties exercised their\nperemptory strikes on November 29, 2o2l whether they had read or heard anything about the\ndefendant or Epstein and, at defense counsel’s suggestion, whether there was any reason they could\nnot be fair and impartial. See Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 622:23-625:2; Nov. 29, 2o2l Tr. 727:2-l4. At\nthe conclusion of that process, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. Twelve jurors and\nsix alternates were seated.\nII. Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> and Voir Dire\n\nJuror 5o completed the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and was questioned by the Court during voir\ndire. In his juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he could be fair and impartial.\nFor example, in response to Question l3, he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture,\nsuspicion, bias, sympathy, or prejudice.” See Def. Ex. l. He also indicated that he accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent and the\nGovernment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Def. Ex. l, Question ll.\n\nJuror 5o disclosed in his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he had read on CNN’s website that the\ndefendant was Epstein’s girlfriend, but he stated that he had not formed an opinion about the\ndefendant’s guilt or innocence, and that he had not formed any opinions that might make it difficult\nfor him to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 34-35. He also wrote that he learned\nabout Epstein from CNN, but that he could be fair and impartial and render a verdict based solely\non the evidence presented at trial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 36-4l.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page9of 49\n\nJuror 5o indicated that there was nothing about the nature of the case and the accusations\nas summarized in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that might make it difficult for him to be fair and impartial.\nSee Def. Ex. l, Question 42. He also wrote that he did not have any views about laws concerning\nthe age of consent or laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against minors that would\naffect his ability to be fair and impartial. See Def. Ex. l, Questions 43-44. Juror 5o answered that\nhe would not have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or\nabuse just like he would any other witness. See Def. Ex. l, Question 47. Juror 5o checked the\n“no” box in response to the question of whether he or a friend or family member had ever been the\nvictim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault, including actual or atempted sexual\nassault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\nteacher, or family member. See Def. Ex. l, Question 48. He also checked the “no” box in response\nto the question of whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had ever been a victim of a\ncrime. See Def. Ex. l, Question 25.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 23l prospective jurors that the parties agreed should proceed to\nvoir dire. During voir dire, Juror 5o confirmed that he was able to follou the Court’s instruction\nthat the defendant is “presumed innocent of all charges unless and until the government proves her\nguilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l28:l5-l9. In response to questioning by\nthe Court about his knouledge of the defendant from the media, Juror 5o explained that he “heard\nwhen Jeffrey Epstein had died that he had a girlfriend,” and reaffirmed that he was “[a]bsolutely”\nable to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the case based on\nthe facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s instructions\nas to the law. /d. at l3o:3-l8; see also id. at l3o:l9-l3l:7.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 49\n\nWhen asked “[d]o you use social media,” he responded: “I do, but I actually just deleted\nthem because I got out of a relationship and I didn’t want to see anything regarding them. So Iam\nfully off of it right nou.” The Court asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” Juror 5o\nresponded, “I used Facebook and Instagram,” but that he had deleted his accounts “last week” and\nthat before that his use consisted of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” See id. at l33:lo-2l.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, in response to questions from the Court, Juror 5o stated that\nhe had no doubt about his ability to be fair to both sides and that he did not have any reason to\nthink he could not be fair and impartial. See id. at l34:l5-22.\n\nJuror 5o was one of the 58 qualified prospective jurors and was ultimately one of the l2\njurors who deliberated.\n\nWl. Juror 5o’s Public Statements Follouing the Verdict\n\nFollouing the verdict in this case, Juror 5o discussed his experience as a juror during\ninterviews with multiple journalists.\n\nFirst, on or about January 4, 2o22, The Independent published an article reporting an\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. A). According to the article,\nJuror 5o stated during this interview that he is “a survivor of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 2). Juror 5o\nreportedly indicated that he did not disclose the sexual abuse he experienced until “high school.”\n(/d. at 2). According to the article, Juror 5o “said he could not remember the details” of the juror\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, “but felt he had answered all questions honestly.” (/d. at 5).\n\nSecond, on or about January 5, 2o22, The Daily Mail published an article reporting another\ninterview with Juror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. B). The online version of this\narticle was accompanied by an approximately l9-minute video of Juror 5o discussing his jury\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo98o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagell of 49\nservice. According to this article, Juror 5o “went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was\n‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye.” (/d. at 2). During\nthis same interview, Juror 5o indicated that he “could not remember” the part of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nasking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but he “was certain that he had answered all\nquestions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 5o also told this interviewer that his oun experience of sexual\nabuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty.” (d.).\n\nThird, on or about January 5, 2o22, Reuters published an article reporting an interview with\nJuror 5o regarding his jury service. (See Gov’t Ex. C). When asked about the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nJuror 5o reportedly said “he ‘flew through’ the initial <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and also did not recall being\nasked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he would have answered\nhonestly.” (/d. at 3).°\n* This video is different from the video atached as Defense Exhibit 3 to the defense’s motion. The\nlengthier video is viewable at htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-\nMaxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html.\n> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 5o’s public\nstatements excludes any reference to statements that Juror 5o made about what “occurred during\nthe jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The defendant’s brief, in an apparent\natempt to shou bias or prejudice, contains a recitation of certain of Juror 5o’s statements about\nwhat happened during deliberations. (See Def. Mem. at l2-l5). Those statements are not\nadmissible in these proceedings. See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 44 (2ol4). But the Court\nshould not be misled by the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror 5o’s statements, because a\nreview of the full interviews reveals the impartiality with which he approached this case and the\ncare that the jury took when deliberating. For example, Juror 5o told The Independent that the jury\n“didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two” because “there just wasn’t any direct\nevidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”\n(Gov’t Ex. A at 5). During that same interview, Juror 5o explained that he voted to convict the\ndefendant on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because\n“the accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence.” (/d. at 2). He further\nexplained that he rejected Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had never conducted a study\non whether [the tactics she studied] would work with memories of sexual abuse.” (/d. at 4).\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel7 of 49\nShaoul. Thus, in the Second Circuit,’ it is a “threshold requirement” to establish that a juror\nintentionally lied or consciously deceived the court. See Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5; Nix, 275 F. Supp.\n3d at 437; Satar, 395 F. Supp. 2d at 72 (“The failure to answer honestly must be deliberate; a\n‘juror’s good faith failure to respond, though mistaken, [does] not satisfy even the first prong of\nthe test.’” (quoting Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5)); United States v. Ruggiero, No. 97 Civ. 2925 (HB),\n2ool WL 28675l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2ool) (rejecting claim of juror misconduct in voir\ndire, concluding “it is not clear that [the juror’s] failure to respond to the Court’s question was a\ndeliberate atempt at dishonesty, as she only failed to answer the court’s question.”); Perez v.\nManhatan Jeep Eagle, No. 92 Civ. 952l (DLC), l997 WL 4o3458, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. July l7, l997)\n(“[T]he first prong of the test requires a determination of whether juror number one deliberately\nlied to the Court during voir dire, or whether his answer was the result of a good faith\nmisunderstanding of the question.”).\n\nIn sum, to satisfy the first prong of the governing test, the defendant must establish\ndishonesty by Juror 5o—a deliberate falsehood or deceit, rather than an honest mistake.\n\nb. The Current Record Does Not Support a Finding of Deliberate\nFalsehood\n\nOn the current record, there is no basis for the Court to find that Juror 5o gave any\ndeliberately false answer during voir dire. To be sure, if his public statements regarding being a\nvictim of sexual abuse were truthful,!° it would appear that Juror 5o answered Question 48\n? While some circuits have reached a different result, the Second Circuit’s view appears to be the\nprevailing one. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Greene, l5o F.3d 357, 364 n.3 (4th Cir. l998) (collecting\nae 4 of course possible that Juror 5o’s unsworn public statements were not truthful, while his\nsworn answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> were. This is a threshold fact that must be determined at a\nhearing. But for purposes of discussion in this brief, the Government assumes that Juror 5o’s\npublic statements on this subject were truthful.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page l8 of 49\ninaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available\ninformation, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not\na deliberate falsehood.\n\nJuror 5o’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he\nlied. Juror 5o has publicly stated that he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did not recall being\nasked about his oun history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he\nbelieved he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t\nEx. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of\nsexual abuse on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse\nhistory.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :2l). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse\nhistory, Juror 5o responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I\nwould have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).\nThe defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 5o apparently began blushing, but that reaction\nis perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.\n\nIndeed, Juror 5o remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually\nabused. (/d. at l:o9). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been\nthe victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the\nlast ina lengthy <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> composed of 5l questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,\na juror who was indeed flying through the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> may have, by the 48\" question (not\nincluding sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.\nThough careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make\nmistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English\nusage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009817.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel9 of 49\nwhich are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o,\n973 (9th Cir. l998) (“[W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their\nminds, misunderstand a question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”); United States\nv. Fell, No. ol Cr. l2, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (“[T]he writen juror\nquestionnaires must be viewed in context. The long <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in particular consisted of 75\nquestions not including sub-parts.””).!! And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 5o’s explanation\nas to why, if he was indeed a victim of sexual abuse, he answered this question in the negative is\nproperly resolved not based on a review of unsworn public statements, but at a hearing at which\nthe Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility.\n\nFurthermore, the defendant’s suggestion that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to serve on\nthe jury is undermined by several aspects of Juror 5o’s conduct. For example, when answering\nthe questions about exposure to pretrial publicity, Juror 5o disclosed that he had read about the\ndefendant and her connection to Epstein. If a juror was willing to lie about sexual abuse to ensure\nthat he was seated on the jury, he would, presumably, have lied about other potentially\ndisqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 5o deliberately lied under penalty of perjury in order\nto serve on the jury, it would make litle sense for him to immediately publicize that fact, thus\nexposing himself to criminal liability. See Perez, l997 WL 4o3458, at *6 (“I find it improbable\nthat a juror who lied on voir dire in order to be empaneled on a jury in an age discrimination case\nto avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the lawsuit would\nreveal this motivation after rendering a verdict. If this had been the juror’s intent, there was no\nreason why he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately follouing the verdict.”).\n\n'! Indeed, Juror 5o’s counsel, in his motion to intervene, discussed infra at Part III, wrote that Juror\n5o “does not recall answering questions [in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>] regarding his prior experience with\nsexual assault.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 5).\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009819.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2l of 49\none can delete the Instagram app from one’s phone without deleting the account at all.!* And the\ndefendant’s screenshots shou that Juror 5o was not hiding anything: His Instagram use did appear,\nas he stated, to consist of “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” (Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l33; see Def. Mem.\nat 2o). There is no basis for concluding that Juror 5o deliberately lied during voir dire about his\nsocial media activity.\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s argument that the Court should grant her motion based purely on\nunsworn public statements by Juror 5o is unpersuasive. That said, given the apparent\ninconsistency between Juror 5o’s public statements that he was a victim of sexual abuse and his\nanswer to Question 48 on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Government believes that a limited evidentiary\nhearing on that subject is warranted to determine whether he answered Question 48 falsely and, if\nso, whether that answer was deliberate or inadvertent. The Government addresses the proper scope\nof that hearing in Part I, infra.\n\n2. The Defendant Has Failed to Satisfy the Second Prong of McDonough\na. The Second Prong of McDonough Requires the Court to\nDetermine Whether It Would Have Granted a Hypothetical\nChallenge\n\nThe defendant’s brief states: “The second question is whether truthful responses from Juror\nNo. 5o would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (Def. Mem. at 29 (citing\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3)). This omits an important aspect of the relevant standard, which provides\nthat in order to make that decision, “the district court must ‘determine if it would have granted the\nhypothetical challenge.’” Stewart, 433 F.3d at 3o4 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58,\nl7l (2d Cir. 2oo2)). Critically, that determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and ““‘[t]here\n2 See, e.g., htps://www.guidingtech.com/what-happens-when-you-uninstall-instagram-from-\nphone/.\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo98l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 33 of 49\n“Tt]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with the least possible harm\nto other interests.” United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 4o (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting Moten,\n582 F.2d at 666); see also Miller v. United States, 4o3 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. l969) (court should\navoid “dangers presented by inquiries that go beyond objective facts: inhibition of jury-room\ndeliberations, harassment of jurors, and increased incidence of jury tampering.”’). Indeed, “the\nproper functioning of the jury system requires that the courts protect jurors from being harassed\nand beset by the defeated party in an effort to secure from them evidence of facts which might\nestablish misconduct sufficient to set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664 (quotation omited).\nThus, “when and if it becomes apparent that the . . . reasonable grounds to suspect prejudicial jury\nimpropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Sun Myung Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234.\n\nThe district court “has the pouer and the duty to supervise and closely control such\ninquiries.” United States v. Calbas, 82l F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. l987). For example, the Court\nmay choose to personally conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid intruding on the\nJury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas, 82l F.2d at 896. A district court may also determine to\nhold the hearing in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; see also United States v. Shakur, 723\nF. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. l988), aff'd 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. l989).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Government believes that the exacting standard for a\npost-verdict hearing has been met only with respect to Juror 5o and the apparent inconsistency\nbetween his several public statements (including one on video) about being a victim of sexual\nabuse and his answer to Question 48 on the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Thus, the Government consents\nto a hearing in order to determine (l) whether Juror 5o deliberately lied in response to Question\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo983l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 36 of 49\n\nThis inquiry should be tightly focused. As a threshold mater, the Court should inquire\nwhether Juror 5o’s public statements are true—i.e., whether he was in fact a victim of sexual\nabuse.'® If the answer is yes, then the Court should determine why Juror 5o nevertheless answered\n“no” to Question 48. Finally, the Court should ask such questions as to permit it to make the\nhypothetical determination posed by McDonough’s second prong: If Juror 5o had accurately\nanswered Question 48, would the Court have struck him for cause?\n\nOn this last subject, the defendant claims that had Juror 5o answered Question 48 in the\naffirmative, the Court and the parties would have “probed” him about various topics, which the\ndefendant suggests are necessary topics of examination. (Def. Mem. at 44). The record refutes\nthat assertion, and inquiry along the lines proposed by the defendant is not necessary.\n\nThe defendant argues that the Court would have inquired whether Juror 5o was able to\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (/d.). As an initial mater, Juror 5o already stated in the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he could\nassess the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like he would any other\nwitness. (Def. Ex. l, Question 47). Moreover, the Court did not ask jurors who answered Question\n48 in the affirmative any follou up questions about Question 47. Accordingly, there is no need to\ninquire about this subject any further at a hearing, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o’s\nanswer to Question 47 was correct.\n\n‘6 The Court need not inquire about the details of the victim’s sexual abuse, just as the Court did\nnot probe such details with respect to other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively. (See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l8-l9, 52-57, 2oo, 2o7-o8, 259, 293, 532, 635). In the event the Court\nbelieves that details need to be elicited, beyond those few details Juror 5o has provided publicly,\nsuch inquiry should be conducted at sidebar or in camera. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544; Shakur,\n723 F. Supp. at 928.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009836.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 38 of 49\nnot have questioned Juror 5o during voir dire about his views about Dr. Loftus or memory, and it\nwould be inappropriate to do so nou.\n\nInstead, the inquiry of Juror 5o should be similar to the inquiry the Court conducted of\nother prospective jurors who answered “yes” to Question 48 of the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. For\nexample, during the voir dire inquiry of Juror l89, after directing the prospective juror to a blank\nversion of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Court’s examination on this subject was as follous:\n\nTHE COURT: Based on your response, what I want to ask is if there\n\nis anything about what you describe here that would interfere in any\n\nway with your ability to be fair and impartial here?\n\nJUROR: No.\n(Nov. l7, 2o2l Tr. at 532:ll-l8). Similarly, the follouing is the voir dire inquiry of Juror 239,\nwho answered “‘yes” to Question 48:\n\nTHE COURT: The first tab is just a blank version of the\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that you filled out. If you turn to page 24, question\n\n48. Do you recall your response to question 48?\n\nJUROR: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Anything about that experience, in light of what I\n\nhave told you about this case, that would interfere in any way with\n\nyour ability to be fair to both sides?\n\nJUROR: There is nothing there.\n(Nov. l8, 2o2l Tr. at 634:25-635:8). These jurors were not asked any further questions about their\nexperiences as victims of sexual abuse, and they were qualified as jurors without objection from\neither party. Thus, while the defendant claims that Juror 5o’s responses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\ndeprived the Court of the opportunity to conduct a probing voir dire examination of Juror 5o\nregarding his views about the defense’s theories in this case, the record proves otherwise. (Def.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9836\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s irrelevant personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to intervene and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto intervene, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 45 of 49\ninto the subject, by allouing [him] an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant\nissues.” (/d. at 7).\n\nIn his motion, Juror 5o’s counsel requested a copy of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, as well as\nthe transcript of his testimony during voir dire. (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). The defendant opposes Juror\n5o’s request, describing it as a “discovery request” and claiming that the release of Juror 5o’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> would prejudice the “investigation” of Juror 5o’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color\nJuror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible posture.” (Def. Mem.\nat 52-53). As an initial mater, the Government notes that Juror 5o’s voir dire was conducted in\nopen court and is therefore available to Juror 5o and his counsel. As to the request for his\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Government submits that Juror 5o should get a copy of his oun <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nThe defendant has characterized Juror 5o’s request for his oun <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> as a\n“discovery request,” but Juror 5o is not a defendant and he is not seeking discovery.!® He is asking\nfor access to his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>: a document that he himself prepared and swore under penalty of\nperjury, and which, nou that trial is complete, is maintained under seal principally if not entirely\nto protect his oun privacy interests. See, e.g., Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,\nRiverside Cty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require\nlimiting access to Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> plainly do not apply to Juror 5o himself or his counsel.'?\n'8 The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under\ninvestigation” “[u]nder analogous circumstances.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that\nargument, the defendant cites only John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. l46 (l989),\nwhich is clearly not analogous as it involved a request under the Freedom of Information Act and\nan ongoing grand jury proceeding.\n\n' On January 24, 2o22, the New York Times Company moved to unseal, among other things, the\nfilled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to\naddress that motion on or before February ll, 2o22 in accordance with the Court’s January 26,\n2o22 order (Dkt. No. 585).\n43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9843\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009844.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the integrity of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions.

The evidence elicited should be the product of all available investigation and research.\nIn Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 976 (9th Cir. l998), cited favorably by the government,\nJudge Kozinski explained the perils of a court conducting a juror bias inquiry with incomplete\ninformation or failing to ask critical questions. \"[A] judge investigating juror bias must find\nfacts, not make assumptions . . . [I]t was the trial court’s obligation to develop the relevant facts\non the record, not merely presume them. The judge’s lack of verve in pursuing the mater casts\ndoubt on his findings.” /d. at 976-77. The Ninth Circuit en banc opinion also was critical of the\ntrial judge’s refusal to allou the defense to subpoena a critical witness of the bias. \"Where juror\nmisconduct or bias is credibly alleged, the trial judge cannot wait for defense counsel to spoon\nfeed him every bit of information which would make out a case of juror bias; rather, the judge\nhas an independent responsibility to satisfy himself that the allegation of bias is unfounded.\" /d.\nat 978.\n\nIf the Court is charged with the responsibility questioning Juror No. 5o, what resources\nwill the Court use to uncover any statements and misstatements made by Juror No. 5o? Will the\nCourt investigate Juror No. 5o’s motives? Will the Court hire an investigator to find all of the\nposts made by Juror No. 5o about the trial? Having witnessed Juror No. 5o during the trial and\nhaving previously questioned Juror No. 5o -- both through a writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and in person -\n- under the government’s farcical hearing the Court would be a (l) witness, (2) inquisitor, (3)\nfactfinder and (4) sole decision maker. These multiple, conflicted, roles are no model of due\nprocess.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9894\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009896.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 644 _ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 27 of 32\nDs | The government therefore wants Juror No. 5o to only\nnou correctly answer Question 48 but not give the details as he would have had to do in\nQuestion 48a in the event he had correctly answered Question 48 at the time of voir dire. The\ngovernment also misses the significant point that none of these other jurors disclosed childhood\nsexual abuse, the facts underlying the charges in this case.\n\nThe government also mischaracterizes the record regarding questions to — and potential\nfor cause challenges against —any juror who may have been incapable of accepting the testimony\nof Ms. Maxwell’s expert, Dr. Loftus. See Resp. at 35-36. The government first only points to\nthe fact that none of the jurors who answered yes to Question 48 were asked about the expert\ntestimony. That is because none of the others — like Juror No. 5o — claimed to have been the\nvictim of childhood sexual abuse, i.e., the charges in this case. Why would anyone have asked\nwhether a groping on the subway as an adult would be replayed like a videotape? Second, this\nCourt inquired of many other potential jurors, including at the request of the government,\nwhether they could put aside their outside knouledge and consider the expert testimony\npresented at trial. See, e.g., Tr. 489-9o, 527-28, 534-39, 666-67, 7o9-lo. There is nothing to\nsuggest that, had Juror No. 5o disclosed his beliefs about the science of memory as he publicly\naired post-verdict in the media (that his oun memory is like a video-tape), that the Court would\nnot have folloued up to inquire whether he could fairly evaluate expert testimony on that topic.\n\n‘o The other jurors who also answered affirmatively to question 48 provided the details,\nas required by the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, to 48a.

Juror No. 5o deliberately mis-\nstated the date of his closing of his Twiter account and therefore Ms. Maxwell is entitled to\ndiscovery in order to prove that deliberate falsehood.\n\n5. Juror No. 5o is not entitled to discovery in advance of the hearing.\n\nFinally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the leters about sealing, Ms.\nMaxwell maintains that Juror No. 5o should not be provided a copy of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which\nis currently under seal in this Court. Providing that <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will only distort the search for\nthe truth by allouing Juror No. 5o to further refine his story and excuses. Of course, if this Court\norders a hearing, Juror No. 5o will receive his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> at that time.

The prosecution’s response is not credible because the government\nhas the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions\nto favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or\nperjury. But when, as here, a juror falsely answers voir dire questions to favor the prosecution,\nthe government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”\n\nBut all trials, perfect or not, require a fair and impartial jury. That is non-negotiable. That\nis the premise and fundamental guarantee of the criminal justice system, a system that was\nundermined by Juror No. 5o’s misconduct.\n\nJuror No. 5o was not fair and impartial. His presence on the jury violated Ms. Maxwell’s\nSixth Amendment rights and constituted structural, reversible error.

The New York Rules of Professional Conduct (hereafter “New York Rules”) specifically\nidentify when a lawyer is obligated to disclose information to the Court. The New York Rules\nare incorporated in the local rules of this Court. See Southern District of New York Local Rule\nl.5(b)(5).\n7.

So the incident that you described in response to 48 in\n\nl3 which, as I understand it, you informed your mother when you\n\nl4 were in high school that when you were nine or ten a family\n\nl5 member had engaged in sexual abuse with you, is that correct?\nl6 A. YS,\n\nl7 Q. So why is that not responsive to question 49?\n\nl8 A. Because I don't consider them part of my family. I never\nl9 considered them part of my family even when they lived with us\n2o for a few years.\n2l Q. And when you filled out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, when you got to\n22 this question were you thinking about what happened to you but\n23 you didn't respond yes because you didn't consider them a\n24 family member, or you didn't consider it?\n25 A.

As you sit here nou, what's the answer to question 49?\n22 A. It would have been -- it would have been yes, that a\n23 stepbrother was accused -- a stepbrother and his friend was\n24 accused of sexual abuse.\n25 Q. Okay.

When did you first learn that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> may contain\n2o a question that asked about sexual abuse history?\nal A. That was during my Daily Mail interview with the reporter\n22 Laura Collins.\n23 Q. So we're talking about your response to 48 which you have\n24 indicated was inaccurate.

I'm going to return to question 25 again, which you have\nl4 indicated was inaccurately responded to, and again you've\nl5 discussed this, but I want to just hear directly in response to\nl6 this guestion, why did you check no?\nl7 A. Well, again, I wasn't thinking about abuse. I don't really\nl8 think about my abuse really much anymore because it doesn't\nl9 define me, it doesn't make me who I am today. It's something\n2o that happened, it's an experience that I lived through, and I\nal have become the person I am today because of my goals and\n22 ambitions.

No, I really -- this is a terrible excuse, but I didn't\n\nl9 really think I would be chosen.\n2o Q. Some of the questions required follou up depending on\n2l whether a yes or no answer was provided. Do you recall that?\n22 A. Yes, your Honor.\n23 Q. And we'll take a guick look at two examples, question 9 on\n24 page 8, question 9 and 9A and question lo and lloA.\n25 Question 9 asked whether your beliefs would make you\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo233\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document645_ Filed o3/ll/22 Pagel9 of 5o l9\nM3 8TMAXl\n\nl unable to render a verdict. You checked no. 9A said: If yes,\n2 please explain. You left that blank. So that question, if a\n\n3 yes response called for explanation, you didn't provide an\n\n4 explanation because you checked no.\n\n5 The next question lo asked about principles of law and\n6 whether you would accept them if selected to serve on the jury,\n7 and you said yes. loA said: If no, please explain. And you\n\n8 folloued that instruction and didn't provide an explanation\n\n9 because you had said yes.\n\nlo You recall there were a number of questions that\n\nll sometimes called for explanation and sometimes didn't?\n\nl2 A. Yes, your Honor.\n\nl3 Q. So hou did you knou whether to include follou-up answers?\nl4 A. So these guestions are in the beginning where I had more\n\nl5 focus than I did at the end and less distractions, so it was\n\nl6 easier to follou along, like these are the first few questions.\nl7 It is a prety thick packet, there's a binder of questions, so\nl8 at this point I was still, I guess, in focus and in the zone\n\nl9 and knew hou to respond to these questions I guess accurately\n2o at this part.\n2l Q. Actually throughout the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> you appeared to have\n22 folloued the instructions with respect to follou-up questions.\n23 A. Right.\n24 Q. I reviewed a lot of questionnaires. Some people would\n25 provide follou-up when it wasn't called for or not provide\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document645_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 5o 2o\nM3 8TMAXl\n\nl follou-up when it was called for. Your <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> seems to\n2 follou the instructions throughout. It appears generally that\n3 you read and folloued the instructions within each question.\n\n4 So hou do you reconcile that with what you just testified to\n\n5 that you were distracted, raced through?\n\n6 A. Prety simply, because you see your answer, you mark a no,\n7 then the next question says \"if yes.\" Well, I marked no, so\n\n8 skip, go to the next question. So that's what I'm talking\n\n9 about when I flew through, I skimmed, I didn't read everything.\nlo So if I had just marked no and it says \"if yes,\" immediately\n\nll move on.\n\nl2 Q. Just to return to 48 nou, sorry to go back, first you told\nl3 me it was a good question, hou long it took you to fill it out,\nl4 and then you said you couldn't remember. I want to go back.

Yeah, I don't remember seeing -- obviously that clock is in\n2l the back and I was facing the front of the courtroom that we\n22 were in, so I wouldn't have even seen that clock.

You say, if you had to estimate, an hour to fill out the\n\n3 <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>?\n\n4 A. Maybe. I think that would be accurate.\n\na Q. And to return to 48, so you just said it was prety easy\n\n6 to, if yes, explain, if no, explain, so you skimmed through\n\n7 that. Looking again at 48, which has sort of a lot of white\n\n8 space for the answer there, do you see that?\n\n9 A. Yes, your Honor.\n\nlo Q. And again, this is hou many of the questions were\n\nll structured: Check box yes self, yes friend or family, or no.\nl2 Tell me again your thought process and hou you\n\nl3 understood the yes self, and yes friend or family.\n\nl4 A. I just read the friend or family, again, like distracted,\nl5 so I missed that \"have you,\" and then \"yes self\" while reading\nl6 this question.\n\nl7 Q. At the time you were filling this out, were you surprised\nl8 the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> asked about friend and family but not about\nl9 you?\n2o A. I didn't honestly think about it.\n2l Q. At the time you filled out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, did you think\n22 that your history of sexual abuse would be something that the\n23 parties and I would want to knou in order to determine if you\n24 could be fair and impartial?\n25 A.

I certainly wouldn't\n\n3 have put myself in a position to where I could -- this position\n\n4 that I'm in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I\n\na just wouldn't have done it.

I understand your point, I still want to just make sure I\nlo understand as someone who is filling out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and\nll sort of walking through life and doesn't think about the\nl2 history of sexual abuse and talk about it, at the same time you\nl3 were prepared for the world to knou about it. Tell me hou to\nl4 make sense of that.\n\nl5 A. It was only hou I view things and hou I can recall\nl6 memories, that's it. I didn't talk about my abuse, I just said\nl7 I can remember things and recall things, like the color of the\nl8 wall or -—-\nl9 Q. Did you think about the fact that many people would learn\n2o from your interview that you had this history of sexual abuse?\n2l A. No, I did not.\n22 Q. You didn't think about that?\n23 A.

I don't knou if they were follouing the news of the case,\n\n3 but I have had some conversations about it with my friends\n\n4 afterward, but most people don't even knou. It's not like -- I\n5 didn't knou much about it either. Sexual abuse isn't a topic\n\n6 that I really want to research or learn about or watch about\n\n7 frequently.\n\n8 Q.

That's\n2o when I questioned you individually in that process that I\n2l suspect nou you knou is called voir dire. You recall that\n22 process?\n23 A. Yes, your Honor.\n24 Q.

I couldn't quite understand what he said at the time,\nl6 something about hou he views himself as a victim or not as a\nl7 victim of a crime. I think we need to understand his healing\nl8 process and what he has gone through, because that affects his\nl9 ability to be an impartial juror in a case involving sexual\n2o abuse. Is this something that he still is seeking treatment\nal for? Is this something he is still thinking? Hou he deals\n22 with the healing process and hou he thinks about himself as a\n23 victim affects hou he views the victim witnesses in this case,\n24 and I think there ought to be more questions about that.\n25 THE COURT: What's the proposed question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo243\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document645_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 3o of 5o 3o\nM3 8TMAXl\n\nl our follou up: Hou long did this go on? When did it stop?\n\n2 Were you home when this happened? What was the interaction\n\n3 between you and the abusers and family members? These are all\n4 things that go to the similarity.\n\n5 THE COURT: I have the same response. I considered\n\n6 those questions. We had, I think it was Juror 2l who had\n\n7 talked about familial abuse. The defense didn't propose any\n\n8 comparable follou-up questions. The questions went to the core\n9 questions of impartiality and fairness. The defense didn't\n\nlo request those questions and they didn't move to strike for\n\nll cause.

After\nthe thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this Court, it is crystal clear that the defendant\nreceived a fair trial.

And\nin any event, had Juror 5o accurately reported in his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that he had been a victim of\nsexual abuse, he would not have been struck for cause. Juror 5o repeatedly explained—yjust as he\ndid during voir dire—that he would be fair and impartial and would decide the case based on the\nevidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. Accordingly, under controlling Supreme\nCourt and Second Circuit precedent, the defendant cannot shou that Juror 5o harbored any bias\nagainst the defendant. Moreover, during voir dire, multiple other potential jurors in this case\nreported having experienced sexual abuse and were nonetheless qualified as jurors without any\nobjection from the defendant. It was entirely appropriate for Juror 5o to sit on this jury, and nothing\nabout his service as a juror calls into question the integrity of the verdict in this case.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010295.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page5ofl6\nintended to mislead the Court while completing his jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> or during voir dire. Juror\n5o testified under oath that he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he\nhas] ever made in [his] life.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:23-24). On this record, the defendant cannot\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nIn particular, at the hearing, Juror 5o acknouledged that he inaccurately answered Question\n48 of the writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which asked prospective jurors whether they themselves or any\nfriends or family members had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault.\nJuror 5o explained that he “didn’t see the part [of Question 48] where it says self, I just—I\ncompletely skimmed way too fast.” (/d. at l4:lo-ll; see also id. at l4:23-l5:2). The <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nand the process by which Juror 5o completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> “must be viewed in context.”\nUnited States v.

July 24, 2ol4).\nJuror 5o’s description of the process of completing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> on November 4, 2o2l\ncredibly explained hou he came to make unintentional mistakes on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Juror 5o\ntestified that he arrived at the courthouse early, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,\nand then sat in the courthouse for hours before the Court’s video with instructions on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was played successfully. (Ud. at l2:4-6, l4:lo-l9). He explained that by the time\nhe was answering the later questions in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, such as Question 48, he was “super\ndistracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their\nquestionnaires and “all the noise going on around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking\nMcDonough’s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further, the\ndefendant suggests that Shaoul is inconsistent with United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir.\nl993), which—the defendant says—held that deliberateness is not required on prong one. She\ntherefore argues that, as the earlier decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt. No. 644\nat l2-l3). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not inconsistent with Langford; rather, the\ndefendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 4l F.3d at 8l5-l6.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo295\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010296.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page6ofl6\nquestions, there was papers being ripped off the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> packets, and there’s a lot of talking\ngoing on, and it’s super distracting.” (/d. at l2:l2-2o, l4:ll-l2). He candidly told the Court that\nhe wanted to finish the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and that he never expected to actually serve on the jury,\ngiven the “sheer volume of people there.” (/d. at l2:2-3, l2:l7, l3:l8, l4:l2-l3; see also id. at\nl8:6-ll (explaining that “grouing up in school I never wanted to be last one finished. You want\nto finish your test and go hang out with your friends. So it’s kind[] of that same policy .. . everyone\nelse is finishing . . . I’m like: I’m never going to get chosen, let’s get this done with.”)). He\ncontrasted filling out the later questions of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> with the earlier questions where he\n“was still... in focus and in the zone” and “had more focus than [he] did at the end and less\ndistractions, so it was easier to follou along.” (Jd. at l9:l4-2o).’\n\nJuror 5o testified that he “[a]bsolutely [did] not” “in any way intentionally provide an\ninaccurate answer” to Question 48; that he “[a]bsolutely [did] not” answer no to Question 48 to\n“make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”; and that he did “[nJot at all” try to\ntailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more likely that [he] would be\nselected for the jury.” (/d. at l5:23-l6:8). And he was emphatic that “this is never anything that\n[he] intended or did on purpose,” and he “certainly wouldn’t have put [him]self in . . . this\nposition.” (/d. at 23:2-8).\n\n? To be sure, Juror 5o should have realized that Question 48 was asking about his oun experience\nand not just those of family and friends, given the purpose of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. But as he testified,\nwhile he realizes in retrospect that this is information the parties would have wanted to knou, at\nthe time he “honestly didn’t think about it.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 2l:l7-22:3). Given Juror 5o’s\ntestimony about his lack of focus at this point in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and the fact that jurors cannot\nbe held to the standard of trained lawyers, this fact does not detract from his credibility. See\nMcDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“Called as they are from all walks of life, many [jurors] may be\nuncertain as to the meaning of terms.”); Dyer v. Calderon, l5l F.3d 97o, 973 (9th Cir. l998)\n(“[ W]e must be tolerant, as jurors may forget incidents long buried in their minds, misunderstand\na question or bend the truth a bit to avoid embarrassment.”’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo296\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010297.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 of l6\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 48 was clear and consistent. He made a mistake. His\ntestimony did not evince any intent to deceive or mislead the Court when completing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Rather, it was consistent with his statements in the Daily Mail interview, which\nwas when Juror 5o first learned that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> may have contained a question that asked\nabout his oun sexual abuse history. (/d. at l5:l9-22). And it was during the Daily Mail interview,\nwhen first confronted with the possibility of having made a mistake, that Juror 5o told the reporter\nthat he “could not remember” the part of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> asking whether he had experienced\nsexual abuse, but he “‘was certain that he had answered all questions honestly.” (Dkt. No. 643, Ex.\nB at 8). Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing echoed his comments to the press when he\nlearned of his error. Juror 5o did not knou he “had made a huge mistake,” and upon learning this\ninformation during the interview, he was “embarrassed and sort of like shocked and didn’t knou\nthat was the full question.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 44:l9-45:3).\n\nJuror 5o’s sworn testimony about the mistakes he made when completing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—which related to the single topic of the sexual abuse he experienced as a nine-year-\nold—similarly made clear that he did not intend to inaccurately answer Questions 25 and 49.\nWhen the Court inquired at the hearing about Juror 5o’s answer to Question 25—which asked\nwhether he or any relatives or close friends had been a victim of a crime—Juror 5o explained that\n“TlJjooking back at [Question 25] nou,” his negative answer was incorrect. (/d. at 9:22). He\nexplained that he “wasn’t thinking of [his] sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime because [he]\nno longer associate[s] being a victim” and that he had been thinking of whether he had been\n“robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that” at the time he was completing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. (/d. at lo:4-9; see also id. at l6:l7-25 (“I do not feel that I am a victim of a\ncrime... .”)). Against this backdrop, it is understandable that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>’s inquiry about\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo297\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010298.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 8 ofl6\n“crime” did not prompt Juror 5o to disclose his experience of childhood sexual abuse, which was\nnot criminally prosecuted, on his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Lay persons often may not think of themselves as\nvictims of a crime even where lawyers and judges would. See, e.g., Fell, 2ol4 WL 36978lo, at\n*6-7, *l3 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did not disclose past sexual abuse in response to\nquestion about whether she had been a victim of a crime because she did not consider the abuse,\nfor which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime). Juror 5o plainly stated that he “[a]bsolutely\n[did] not” “[iJn any way . . . intentionally provide an inaccurate answer” to Question 25; that he\ndid not answer no to Question 25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected for the jury”;\nand that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more\nlikely that [he] would be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l7:l-lo).\n\nThe same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 5o explained that he had been abused\nby a stepbrother “who is no longer a part of the family” (id. at 8:l4-l5, 9:3-8), the Court directed\nJuror 5o’s atention to Question 49, which asked whether he, a friend, or family member had ever\nbeen accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. Juror 5o initially stated that\nhis negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked why Juror 5o’s sexual abuse\nby a family member did not count, and Juror 5o responded “[b]ecause I don’t consider them part\nof my family. I never considered them part of my family even when they lived with us for a few\nyears.” (/d. at ll:l2-2o). Only after the Court pressed Juror 5o and asked him several pointed\nquestions about Question 49, did Juror 5o realize that he should have answered yes to that question\n“Tb ]ecause by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” (/d. at l3:5-6).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony about Question 49 illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out a\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> cannot be held to the standard of a trained lawyer conducting a close examination of\na document. See McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555; Dyer, l5l F.3d at 973. Juror 5o’s answer to\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo298\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010299.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page 9ofl6\nQuestion 49 was not precisely accurate, as he freely acknouledged at the hearing. But, as he\nexplained, at the time he completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, it did not occur to him that his oun abuse\nrequired an affirmative answer. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at ll:25). And when asked during the hearing,\nhis initial answer reflected an honest and reasonable understanding of the question: he answered\nno because he did not consider his former stepbrother, who he never considered to be part of his\nfamily, as a family member. See United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo4) (“Would a reasonable juror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to\nhim?’”), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273 (2d Cir. 2oo6). It was only once the Court focused his atention on\nthe literal meaning of the question that he realized a different answer was accurate. Juror 5o’s\nanswers on this score bespeak a lack of linguistic precision, not a lack of credibility.\n\nJurors can and do make mistakes, and a defendant is entitled to fairness, not perfection.\nSee McDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-55 (“This Court has long held that [a litigant] is entitled to a fair\ntrial but not a perfect one, for there are no perfect trials. .. . To invalidate the result of a three-\nweek trial because of a juror’s mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist on\nsomething closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.” (alteration in\noriginal, internal quotation marks omited)). It is clear that Juror 5o made a mistake from a failure\nto be careful, and not a desire to get on the jury. Juror 5o repeatedly and consistently testified\nunder oath that he did not try to get on the jury. In response to questioning by the Court, Juror 5o\nexplained, without hesitation, that he “did not hope to be on this jury” and that he “did not set out\nin order to get on this jury.”? (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:2-5). He did not even knou what case he\n3 Nothing about this argument is undermined by Juror 5o’s comment that “if you’re going to serve\njury duty, it might as well [] be something that’s interesting.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at l4:2-4). To the\ncontrary, that comment demonstrates Juror 5o’s candor at the hearing. Juror 5o said that ifhe had\nto serve jury duty, this case was “something interesting” when compared to more boring cases.\n(Id. at 44:8-ll; see id. at 44:6 (“So not everybody gets called for jury duty.”)).

U/d. at l3:2o-2l, l7:2o-22). He further explained that he\n“honestly never thought [he] would be chosen to sit on this jury” because of the “sheer volume of\npeople” present for jury selection; he thought “surely they will be interviewing thousands of\npeople. And they ultimately choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I would be\none of those twelve.” (/d. at l2:3-4, l3:l8-25).\n\nThe hearing held by this Court made clear that Juror 5o did not deliberately lie or engage\nin deceit in completing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Juror 5o made an “honest mistake.” (/d. at 23:5). The\ndefendant’s motion fails at the first prong of the McDonough test.\n\nB. The Record Does Not Support a Finding that the Court Would Have\n\nGranted a Hypothetical for Cause Challenge\n\nThe hearing established that Juror 5o harbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case based on the evidence and the Court’s legal\ninstructions. If Juror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating to sexual abuse in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Court would have asked Juror 5o follou up questions during voir dire to\ndetermine if it would have granted a challenge for cause. The Court asked those questions at the\nhearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made clear that he was a fair and impartial juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been excused for cause. Because the defendant cannot\nestablish that Juror 5o was biased, she is not entitled to the extraordinary relief she seeks.\nprospective juror would agree that, if required to serve on a jury, they would rather do so on an\ninteresting case, and surely many prospective jurors would find this case more interesting than a\ncontract dispute or the like. But as Juror 5o made clear repeatedly, including twice in that same\ncolloquy, he “did not set out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at l4:4-5). Were he atempting to\nlie or mislead the Court, he surely would have omited that comment and left his answer at “I did\nnot hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at l4:2). Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,\ndemonstrating his candor at the hearing—including his candor that he made no effort to be selected\nas a juror.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010301.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Pagellofl6\n\nAt the hearing, the Court questioned Juror 5o to determine whether, if he had answered\naccurately, it would have granted a hypothetical strike for cause. The record before this Court\nmakes clear that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. The Court began by asking Juror\n5o what his answers would have been to Questions 25(a), 48(b), and 49(b) of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nwhich asked whether his experience would have prevented him from being a fair and impartial\njuror in this case. Juror 5o repeatedly indicated that he would have answered those questions in\nthe negative. For example, when asked hou he would have answered Question 48(b)—which\nasked if his prior experience with sexual abuse would affect his ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in the case—Juror 5o responded that his answer “would have been no,\nbecause it did not affect [his] ability to be fair and impartial at all.” (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 9:l5-l6;\nsee also id. at lo:23-24 (“[An accurate answer to Question 25(a)] would have been no. I was\ndefinitely able to set aside everything and be fair and impartial.”)). Juror 5o unequivocally stated,\n“In no case [would my experience affect my ability to serve fairly and impartially]. It would not\naffect me.” (/d. at l3:l5).\n\nAfter asking Juror 5o hou he would have answered those follou-up questions on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Court took Juror 5o “back in time” to November l6, 2o2l, the day of voir dire,\nand asked Juror 5o the additional questions it would have asked that day had Juror 5o accurately\nfilled out Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. (/d. at 24:l8-27:l7). In response to the\nCourt’s question as to whether his history of sexual abuse would affect his ability to be a fair and\nimpartial juror, Juror 5o testified that his prior experience with sexual abuse “would not affect [his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror] in any way” and that he would not be “thinking about [his]\noun experience in a way that would prevent [him] from being fair or impartial.” (/d. at 25:l7-22,\n27:4-6). Juror 5o explained that there was nothing about his experience that would have affected\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010302.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l2 of l6\n\nhis ability to render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial and the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law, and that “[a]bsolutely in no way” would his experience with prior sexual\nabuse interfere with his ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. (/d. at\n25:23-26:lo). Juror 5o answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evinced\nthat he was a fair and serious juror who deeply regreted making an inadvertent error. See Greer,\n285 F.3d at l7l (quoting United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 44 (2d Cir. l997), for the proposition\nthat a “finding of actual bias is based upon determinations of demeanor and credibility that are\npeculiarly within a trial judge’s province.”).‘\n\nOn this record, it is evident that Juror 5o would not have been struck for cause. Of the 58\nindividuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals disclosed in their writen\nquestionnaires that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or\n* Juror 5o’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual\nabuse through his press interviews do not undermine his credibility. While the trial participants,\nwho have been atentive to developments in this case for years, quickly learned of Juror 5o’s\nstatements, Juror 5o reasonably thought differently about his friends and family. As Juror 5o\nexplained, his family and friends “didn’t even knou that this trial was even happening” when he\nrevealed that he had been on the jury through social media—media in which he did not reveal his\noun experience with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 42:l5-43:9). Juror 5o therefore expected that “a\nlitle article about a juror giving their experience wouldn’t be. . . really in the news at all.” (/d. at\n42:2l-23). His family and friends appear not to have consumed media about the trial—yjust like\nmany of the actual and prospective jurors in this case, who reported no or almost no exposure to\nthe defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, e.g., Juror 7; Juror 2o; Juror 37;\nJuror 54; Juror 89; Juror l5l). It is even more unlikely that they would learn about his experience\nwith abuse given that Juror 5o did not use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from\nhis Google search results, and that he gave two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.\nNo. 643 at 8-9). And Juror 5o did not think that his interviews would trigger significant public\natention and further proceedings in the case because he had atempted to answer the questions\nhonestly and had nothing to hide. (Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this would\nhappen... if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul. I certainly wouldn’t have put myself\nin a position . . . this position that I’m in nou, potentially any sort of criminal charges, I just\nwouldn’t have done it. It was an honest mistake ....”)). At worst, Juror 5o’s expectations about\nthe consequences of his interviews reflect naivety; they do not reflect deception.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010303.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 648 Filed o3/l5/22 Page l3 of l6\nsexual assault. In each case, during voir dire, each juror affirmed to the Court that he or she could\nbe fair and impartial. Not only did the Court not strike each of those eight jurors for cause, but\nneither party even moved to do so on these grounds. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 4-6, 2o). Thus, if Juror\n5o had disclosed his history of sexual abuse in the writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Court would not have\nimmediately granted a challenge for cause, but would have instead asked additional follou-up\nquestions. Juror 5o’s answers to the follou-up questions, as given at the hearing, shoued that he\ncould be fair and impartial notwithstanding his prior experience.\n\nThe defendant cannot demonstrate that Juror 5o was biased. At the hearing, Juror 5o\nrepeatedly denied that he harbored any bias or feelings one way or another with respect to the\ndefendant or the Government. (See Mar. 8, 2o22 Tr at 26:l5-2o; see also id. at 27:l3-l7\n(explaining that he had “‘no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both sides); id. at 26:2l-23 (“Q.\nDid you want to put your thumb on the scale in any direction? A. No.”)). To the contrary, Juror\n5o consistently testified that he was fair and impartial in this case and that he rendered a verdict\nconsistent with the evidence and the Court’s instructions of law.> That testimony is consistent\nwith Juror 5o’s statements during oral voir dire, during which Juror 5o reaffirmed that he was\n“Ta|bsolutely” able to put aside anything that he read or heard about the defendant and decide the\ncase based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follou the Court’s\ninstructions as to the law.

As Juror 5o later explained, that response was derived from the fact that he “began\nto float, fly through it, in order to get done” and was “super distracted.” (/d. at 4o:l8-2o). It did\nnot reflect a general disobedience of the Court’s instructions, and indeed, Juror 5o made clear that\nhe carefully folloued the Court’s instructions during voir dire—during which he paid atention to\nthe Court’s instructions, listened carefully to the Court’s questions, “answered every single one of\nthose questions accurately,” and did not “at all” fail “to pay atention to the specifics of the\nquestions”—and during trial.

If there is one thing we\nlearned from Juror 5o at the Hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury.\nJuror 5o conceded that he gave false responses to not one, but three critical questions on the juror\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, all of which, had he answered them truthfully, would have revealed his prior\nsexual abuse. The abuse Juror 5o described at the Hearing, which he should have disclosed on\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and during voir dire, was remarkably similar to the abuse described by the\ngovernment’s four key victim witnesses and would, by itself, have formed the basis for a\nchallenge for cause. Moreover, his answers to the Court’s questions, which he gave after careful\npreparation by his atorney and under the protection of government-granted immunity, alternated\nbetween inconsistent, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility.\n\nJuror 5o’s explanation that he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> does not hold water, and\nhis repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a child did not affect\nhis ability to be a fair and impartial juror were self-serving and simply not believable.

In fact, Juror 5o’s\nresponses only further revealed his bias. In the end, what was evident before the Hearing is even\nmore clear after the Hearing — had Juror 5o given truthful answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, his\nbiases and sympathies would have been fully explored and he would have been challenged, and\nexcluded, for cause. Instead, Juror 5o’s false responses to the most critical questions on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> undermined voir dire and deprived Ms. Maxwell of her constitutional right to a\ntrial by a fair and impartial jury.\nl. The Hearing Testimony Established that Juror 5o Falsely Answered Three Critical\n\nQuestions on the Jury <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>.\n\nThere can be no dispute that Juror 5o’s testimony established conclusively that he falsely\nanswered three separate questions on the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> — Questions 48, 25, and 49. It is no\ncoincidence that Juror 5o gave false answers to these questions. These were the questions that,\nhad he answered truthfully, would have revealed his prior sexual abuse. Question 48 asked\n“Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\nabuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 24). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror\n5o admited that this was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self)”\nbecause he had, in fact, been sexually abused as a child by his stepbrother and his friend. (Tr. 7-\n8). Question 25 asked “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim of\nacrime?” (Court Exhibit #l at l3). Juror 5o had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror 5o admited that\nthis was not an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (self) because of the\nsame childhood sexual abuse. (Tr. 9-lo). Finally, in light of Juror 5o’s statement that he had\nbeen sexually abused by his stepbrother, the Court confronted Juror 5o about his answer to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010310.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page4ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable\nbias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). In determining\nwhether Juror 5o was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[l] the\n\nsimilarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope\nand severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.\nUnited States, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l\" Cir. 2ol3) (citations omited). The record developed at the\nHearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 5o’s bias and established that,\nhad he answered the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> honestly, he would have been struck for cause.\n\nA. The Similarity Between Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual\n\nAbuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly\nparalleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 5o\nhad already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity\nto question Juror 5o further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity\nthat Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—\nrevealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at\ntrial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor, (il) was abused on\nmultiple occasions over the course of several years, and (i) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-\n9). Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused by two people who were friends and who each\nparticipated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or\nsexually assaulted by someone he did not knou. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his\nstepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the relationship\nbetween their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nabout hou memory can be corrupted and rendered him incapable of objectively evaluating a\ncentral aspect of Ms. Maxwell’s defense. (Motion at 32-33).\n\nThe Court should not credit Juror 5o’s repeated assurances that he would not, and did not,\nlet his past experience of sexual abuse affect his ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the\nevidence. Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become\nirrelevant.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 558). Here, the record establishes\nthat Juror 5o was biased and would have been struck for cause had he truthfully disclosed his\nhistory of sexual abuse.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s Answers to the Court’s Questions Were Not Credible and Further\n\nRevealed His Bias\n\nJuror 5o’s responses to the Court’s questions at the Hearing were rife with contradictions\nand inconsistencies. His explanation for his false statements on the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—that he\n“flew through” the questions and did not see that multiple questions called for him to disclose his\nsexual abuse—lacked all credibility. And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find\nout about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the international press, including a\nvideo interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was\nuterly implausible. Juror 5o’s false statements and his explanation for those false statements, a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010314.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page8ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nsample of which are provided belou, provide further evidence of his bias. See Skaggs, l64 F.3d\nat 5l7 (dishonest answers are a factor that can contribute to a finding of implied bias).\n\nFirst, Juror 5o’s explanation that he answered Question 48 falsely because he was\ndistracted and felt rushed and did not see the word “you” and the answer “Yes (self)” are not\ncredible. (Tr. l2-l5, 2l). Juror 5o estimated that he had about an hour to complete the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> (Tr. 2l), more than ample time to review it and answer the questions carefully.\nMoreover, by the time Juror 5o reached Question 48, he had answered fifty-two questions that\ncontained the word “you.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions l-3, 5-32, 33a-f, 34, 34a, 35-47).\nJuror 5o testified that he was still focused when he answered the first several questions in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and was only rushed when he got to the end. (Tr. l9). Hence, even accepting\nJuror 5o’s oun testimony, he would have seen that almost all of the questions in the early part of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> contained the word “you” and asked about the juror himself.\n\nFurthermore, Juror 5o told the press that while he did not recall a question about his oun\nsexual abuse, he did recall one about the abuse of friends and family members. Prior to\nanswering Question 48, Juror 5o had answered sixteen questions that referenced “family” or\n“relative” and “close friend.” (See Court Exhibit l, Questions 2o- 28, 33a-f, 45). Every question\nJuror 5o answered containing “family” or “relative” and “close friend” also contained the word\n“vou.” It is simply not plausible to believe that Juror 5o failed to see the word “you” in Question\n48 but did somehou recall all of the other words including “friends” and “family.”\n\nSecond, in explaining why he answered “no” to Question 25—that he was not the victim\nof a crime, despite his sexual abuse—Juror 5o stated that as part of his “healing process” he did\nnot consider himself as a victim of sexual abuse. (Tr. lo) (“I wasn’t thinking of my sexual abuse\nas being a victim of a crime because I no longer associate being a victim. It’s part of my healing\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010316.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Pageloofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\ndid not disclose that in response to Question 49, which asks whether a family member has ever\nbeen accused of sexual abuse. (Tr. ll-l3). Juror 5o originally answered that “no” was an\naccurate response because he “never considered them part of my family even when they lived\nwith us for a few years.” (Tr. ll). That response contradicted a response he gave only a few\nminutes earlier concerning Question 48, when he first described the abuse to the Court. There,\nhe said he was abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family.” (Tr. 8). He\nthen quickly changed his answer and returned to his familiar refrain that he “flew threw” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and said he “didn’t even consider” whether his stepbrother was a family member.\n(Tr. ll-l2). He then admited that the accurate answer would have been “Yes (friend or family\nmember) because his stepbrother was, in fact, a family member. (Tr. l2-l3). Juror 5o’s shifting\nexplanation for his answer to this question shous an intent to answer this question falsely.\n\nFourth, Juror 5o made a tortured and thoroughly unbelievable atempt to reconcile his\nstatement that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse with his decision to speak\npublicly about his abuse to multiple international media outlets, including the British tabloids,\nand his decision to post on numerous social media accounts. As soon as he was confronted with\nthe obvious inconsistency, he provided an unprompted and obviously rehearsed answer: “I didn’t\nlie in order to get on this jury and then go to the press and tell them about my abuse. It just ...\nit’s a litle illogical thinking about it, like if I lied deliberately I wouldn’t have told a soul.” (Tr.\n22-23). The Court continued to press after his unresponsive answer. When asked if he thought\nabout the fact that many people would learn about his sexual abuse, he responded “No, I did\nnot.” (Tr. 23). He later added that he thought “a litle article about a juror giving their\nexperience wouldn’t be record-breaking or really in the news at all.” (Tr. 42). That is absolute\nnonsense.

STERNHEIAA\n\ntrial ended. There is no question that Juror 5o would have knoun (if he didn’t knou before) that\nthat Maxwell trial was all over the press and was the subject of a massive media blitz. Far from\nhoping to remain anonymous, Juror 5o reveled in the atention and started posting his oun\nmessages on social media, using his actual picture and his real first name, announcing to the\nworld that he was on the Maxwell jury. (See Motion at 2o, Juror 5o’s Instagram Account) (“I\ncan nou tell everyone that I was a juror on the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.”). Juror 5o was not\nlooking to avoid notice. He was looking to soak up his l5 minutes of fame. This, again, is\nstrong evidence of Juror 5o’s bias.\n\nWhether Juror 5o’s false responses were for the purpose of securing a spot on the jury or\nbecause he was deluding himself about his ability to be impartial, Juror 5o’s multiple false\nstatements on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and to the Court add to the bases for finding that he should have\nbeen struck for cause. See Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l65 (“Even when prospective jurors are\ndishonest for reasons other than a desire to secure a seat on the jury, dishonest answers to voir\ndire questions indicate that a juror is unwilling or unable to apply the law as instructed by the\ncourt to the evidence presented by the parties and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of\nimpartiality[.]” (internal quotation marks omited)).\n\nFinally, Juror 5o admited that he was perfectly willing to disregard the Court\ninstructions. In light of his statements that he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the Court asked\nJuror 5o whether he was concerned about follouing the Court’s instructions. (Tr. l8). Juror 5o\nresponded, “Absolutely not.” (/d.). When the Court asked him again, he again responded “No, I\nreally ... this is a terrible excuse, but I didn’t really think I would be chosen.” (/d.). A\nwillingness to disregard the Court’s instructions shous an inability to serve as an unbiased juror\nand raises independent grounds for a for cause challenge. See Dyer v.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo326\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page4of4o\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\n\nI BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. /d. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo327\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page5of4o\n\nThe final <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers. Dkt. No. 462. Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a\nprospective juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, harassment, and assault.\n\nQuestion 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a\nvictim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),” “Yes\n(friend or family member),” and “No.” Jd. at l3. Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there\nanything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in\nthis case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 25b asked: “If\nyes to 25a, please explain.” Several lines were then provided for the prospective juror to explain\ntheir answer. /d.\n\nQuestion 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted sexual assault or other\n\nunwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or\n\nfamily member).\nId. at 24. Like Question 25, there were three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),”\n“Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” Question 48a next asked: “If yes, without listing\nnames, please explain.” Space was provided to write an answer. Question 48b asked: “If your\nanswer to 48 was yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in this case?” There were two answer choices: “Yes” and “No.” Finally,\nQuestion 48c asked: “If yes to 48b, please explain.” Like Question 48a, several lines of space\nwere provided to answer the question. /d.\n\nFinally, Question 49 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of law or\n\ninformal accusations in a social or work seting of actual or atempted sexual assault or\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 6 of 4o\n\nother unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\n\nteacher, or family member.).\nId. at 25. Like Questions 25 and 48, there were three answer options in the follouing order:\n“Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” The follou-up questions to Question\n49 folloued the same structure as the follou-up questions to Question 48. Question 49a asked:\n“Tf yes, without listing names, please explain.” Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was\nyes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in\nthis case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b,\nplease explain.” Jd. The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nId. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010330.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of selection, the Court questioned\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8. Ifa prospective juror\nwas not struck for cause, the Court instructed the nou-qualified juror to return on the morning of\nNovember 29, 2o2l, for the parties’ exercise of peremptory strikes.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s jury selection process\n\nJuror 5o completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> on the morning of November 4, 2o2 l—the first\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> session. Mar. 8, 2o22 Hearing Tr. at 7. In his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Juror 5o checked\n“No” for Question 25. Hearing Exhibit l at l3, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>”). He\nleft Questions 25a and 25b blank. For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside).

Juror 5o\nreplied, “No” and affirmed that he did not have “any reason to think that [he] can’t be fair and\nimpartial here.” /d. at l34.\n\nOn November 29, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. The Defendant used all\nof her strikes. See Nov. 29, 2o2l Trial Tr. at 73l-32. Juror 5o was one of fifty-eight qualified\nprospective jurors, and he was ultimately one of the twelve deliberating jurors. /d. at 733.\n\nC. Juror 5o’s post-verdict interviews and party response\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the jury began deliberations on December 2o, 2o2l. The\njury returned a unanimous verdict on December 29, 2o2l, finding the Defendant guilty of five of\nthe six counts. Dkt. No. 593 at 29-3o.\n\nA week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the Government\ninformed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to press outlets\nabout his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater. Dkt. No. 568. The leter\nnoted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror “described being a\nvictim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did not\nrecall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at l. The Government\nindicated that it believed the juror to be Juror 5o, and a review of his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> shoued that\nhe had provided a negative response to a question that asked whether a prospective juror had\nbeen a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 2 n.2; see also Feb. 25, 2o22 Op. & Order, at 3 & n.l, Dkt.\nNo. 62o.

In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process.

The Court also rejected many of the Defendant’s\nproposed lines of questions. The parties were also permited to propose follou-up questions at\nthe hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 5o’s responses. The Court accepted\nsome of these proposals and rejected others.\n\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate. He\nexplained that when he was nine and ten years old, he was abused on multiple occasions by a\nstepbrother, who he no longer considered part of the family, and one of the stepbrother’s friends.\nHearing Tr. at 8. He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school. His mother\ncalled the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought. /d. at 8-9. Although he first\ntestified that “no” was correct for Question 49 because he did not consider the stepbrother part of\nhis family, upon further questioning from the Court, he acknouledged that the correct answer\nwould have been “yes.” /d. at ll-l3. He similarly acknouledged that “yes (self)” would have\nbeen correct to Question 25; although at the time of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he understood the question\nto be asking about being “robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that.” /d. at 9-lo.\n\nJuror 5o testified that these incorrect answers were an inadvertent mistake and that he had\nnot intentionally failed to disclose his personal history of sexual abuse. /d. at l4-l6, 22-23. He\nexplained that he was distracted as he filled out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and “completely skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand the questions. /d. at l4-l5. It took several hours to start\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> after a long security line and technical issues with the Court’s instructional\nvideo. His mind was preoccupied with a recent romantic breakup and the commotion at the\nnearby check-out table. He saw other prospective jurors completing their questionnaires and\nrushed to finish.

He testified that his\npersonal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not\ncrossed his mind as he filled out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nThe Court asked follou-up questions consistent with those asked of prospective jurors\nduring voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires,\nincluding those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial. Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt.

See Tanner, 483 U.S. at l2o-2l.\n\nFinally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have\nexercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual\nabuse. Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a\nnew trial because Juror 5o’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise\nher peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court. Indeed, in making this argument\nshe cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. But the rule\nin New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See State v. Scher, 65o\nA.2d lol2, lol9-2o (N.J. App. Div. l994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its\nfederal counterpart” of McDonough). Under McDonough, a defendant seeking a new trial must\nshou that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 464\nU.S. at 555-56 (emphasis added). A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the\nperemptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (concluding\nthat a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may\ncertainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for\narguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause”). That difference\narises in part from the fact that “[u]nlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not\nconstitutionally required.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 n.4.\n\nTW. ANALYSIS\nA. McDonough Prong One\n\nThe Court begins with what Juror 5o’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:\n\nJuror 5o provided inaccurate answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. For each\nl5\nDOJ-OGR- ooolo338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010339.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDonough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo339\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Pagel7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6,22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo34l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 _ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt. No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2o of 4o\nyes friend or family, or no.” /d. at l5,2l. Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” /d. at l2—l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. /d. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> ls frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo346\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in Jorres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. /d. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(self)” to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo35o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010353.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.’’);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo353\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010354.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell\nBr. at 3l-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo354\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010359.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 36 of 4o\npersonal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So\nlong as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 8l8. In any event, Rule 6o6(b) bars the Court from relying on these\nstatements because they pertain to Juror 5o’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or\nindictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). “[P]arsing hou jurors considered the evidence or their\nmental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 6o6(b)\nseek to prevent.” United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d lo32, lo36 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (cited favorably\nby United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l32 (2d Cir. 2ol8)); see also United States v. Abcasis,\n8ll F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. l992) (Rule 6o6 does not permit inquiry into jurors’\ndiscussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process” and\nhis hearing testimony as to Question 25 “reveal just hou deeply the trauma affected him and\ncontinues to affect him.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9. The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions\nduring the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo359\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[J]Jurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ,\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deall[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo36o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll—l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” /d. at 4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l. The Court confirmed that Juror 5o “carefully” folloued the Court’s instructions during voir\ndire and trial.

She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\ntk KR ok\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Juror 5o testified credibly and\ntruthfully at the post-trial hearing.

Maxwell, No. 2o-cr-oo33o (AJN) — Unsealing of\nDefendant’s Motion for a New Trial and Questionnaires of Seated\nJurors\nDear Judge Nathan:\nI write on behalf of The New York Times Company (“The Times”) to\nrequest that the Court unseal (a) Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial and\naccompanying brief and exhibits (Dkt. 58o) and (b) the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. These records are subject to\nboth First Amendment and common law rights of access, which set\nstringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with\nonly those redactions necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the\nextent they have not already been disclosed. We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct. On January 5, 2o22, the parties wrote to this Court\nregarding public statements made by one juror, identified as “Juror 5o,”\nabout hou his jury room disclosure that he was a victim of sexual assault\n' The right of access is an affirmative enforceable public right, and it is well-\nestablished that the press has standing to enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe\nNewspaper Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 6o9 n.25 (l982);\nHartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 38o F.3d 83, 9l (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010755.jpg": "Castat2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncuratSs3 AleiGa2522 Aeappe22cbf353\ninfluenced deliberations. See Dkts. 568—7o. When asked about his juror\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which included a question about whether he had been a\nvictim of sexual abuse, the juror asserted that he “flew through” the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did “not recall being asked” this question. Dkt. 568.\nDefendant filed a motion for a new trial and asked the Court to keep the\nmotion completely under seal until it ruled on the motion. Dkt. 58o.\nDefendant’s request for secrecy is contrary to both the common law and\nthe First Amendment.\n\nThe Common Law Right of Access\nThe common law presumption of access ataches to any “judicial\ndocument,” defined as items “relevant to the performance of judicial\nfunction and useful in the judicial process.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). The presumption is\nstrongest when, as here, documents contribute materially to the Article III\npouers of the court—that is, to the rendering of verdicts and orders\naffecting “substantive legal rights.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. v. Onondaga,\n435 F.3d llo, l2l (2d Cir. 2oo6). Once the right ataches, it is overcome\nonly by a shouing that there are “countervailing factors” that outweigh the\npublic’s right to monitor judicial proceedings.\nDefendant’s Motion for New Trial. There is no question that Defendant’s\nmotion, which will directly inform the Court’s assessment of whether a\nnew trial is necessary, is a “judicial document.” See Bernstein v. Bernstein\nLitouitz Berger & Grossman LLP, 8l4 F.3d l32, l4o, l42 (2d Cir. 2ol6).\nBecause the motion will be used to determine the parties’ “substantive\nlegal rights,” the presumptive right of access it at its highest. Jd.\nWe do not see anything on the public record indicating that Defendant has\nmet—or tried to meet—the high shouing required to justify a blanket\nsealing of its motion. It is simply not plausible that every word of a legal\nfiling such as this one requires total secrecy. To the extent that the motion\ncontains any sensitive information, there is a reasonable alternative to\nwholesale sealing: limited redactions of personally identifiable or sensitive\ninformation, if justified under the Lugosch standard. See Amodeo I, 44\nF.3d at l47.\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010756.jpg": "Castat2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncureiSs3 AleiOaW2522 Reape Babifh353\nThe right to public access promises “immediate” and “contemporaneous”\naccess. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26. The Second Circuit has firmly held that\naccess does not—and should not—hinge on whether a judge has ruled on\nthe underlying motion. /d. at l26—27. Instead, delay is “effectively a\ndenial” and undermines the benefits of public scrutiny. /d. at l26. In\nLugosch, the Second Circuit rejected a request to delay access to pending\nsummary judgment papers. So, too, here Defendant’s request for a delay\nshould be denied.\n\nJuror Questionnaires. The juror questionnaires are judicial documents\nbecause they are relevant and useful to the performance of a judicial\nfunction: selecting a jury, a necessary component of a criminal trial. Here,\nthe presumptive right to access to these questionnaires is at its apex. In\neffect, the sealing of the questionnaires is the equivalent of barring the\npublic from the oral voir dire. Defendant’s motion requests a new trial\nbecause of alleged juror misconduct—and specifically, that “a juror failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire.” Dkt. 57o. Juror 5o’s\nquestionnaires will thus, as Defendant recognizes, id., necessarily and\ndirectly affect the Court’s decision on whether the existing finding of guilt\nshould be vacated and whether a new trial is appropriate—fundamental\nArticle III determinations. See Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at l45. The\nquestionnaires for the remaining seated jurors are integral to determining\nwhether this is a lone or recurring incident.\nAny original need for sealing the questionnaires for the seated jurors—for\ninstance, that they might be subject to atempts to influence their\ndeliberations—has nou passed. The trial is over, and the jurors have been\ndismissed.\nThe First Amendment Right of Access\nAn independent First Amendment right of access ataches where public\naccess to a document has historically been available (the “experience”\nprong) and would be valuable to the process in question (the “logic”\nprong). See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal. (“Press-Enterprise\nIT’), 478 U.S. l, 8-9 (l986); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9-2o. Once the right\nataches, it is overcome only by specific, on-the-record findings that\nsealing “is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo756\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010757.jpg": "Castatf2o:2oooSMBBAKINDOncureatSs3 AleiOaW2522 Rrapped4cifh353\nserve that interest” under the First Amendment. Bernstein, 8l4 F.3d at\nl43-45; see also Press-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4.\n\nDefendant's Motion for New Trial. Parties’ motions, briefs, and\naccompanying exhibits related to post-trial proceedings have regularly\nbeen found to be subject to the constitutional right of access, especially\nwhen they involve allegations of jury misconduct. See, e.g., United States\nv. Simone, l4 F.3d 833, 84o (3d Cir. l994); United States v. Gonzalez, 927\nF. Supp. 768, 782 (D. Del. l996); see also CBS, Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for\nCent. Dist. of Cal., 765 F.2d 823, 825 (9th Cir. l985). As with the\ncommon law right, the constitutional right guarantees “immediate access\nwhere a right of access has been found.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l26.\n“[E]ach passing day may constitute a separate and cognizable\ninfringement of the First Amendment” and “unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury.” Jd. (internal citations omited). For the reasons above,\nDefendant’s motion should be unsealed immediately.\nJuror Questionnaires. Juror questionnaires have also regularly been found\nto be subject to the First Amendment right of access. See United States v.\nKing, l4o F.3d 76, 8o, 84 (2d Cir. l998); United States v. Simone, l4 F.3d\n833, 84o (2d Cir. l994); United States v. McDade, 929 F. Supp. 8l5, 8l7\nn.4 (E.D. Pa. l996); In re Newsday, Inc., l59 A.D.2d 667, 669 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. l99o). As explained above, neither party has proposed on the record\nthat there is any interest of any sort to overcome the presumption. Because\nthe First Amendment’s standards for sealing are even more stringent, the\nlack of justification for sealing under the common law standard\nnecessarily means that the First Amendment standard has not been met.\nIt also bears mentioning that the public interest in unsealing these\ndocuments is significant. The question immediately before the Court—\nwhether a new trial should be granted to a high-profile defendant in light\nof statements made by a juror that Defendant alleges are evidence of juror\nmisconduct—is serious and goes to the heart of this Court’s Article I\njudicial pouer. The documents bear directly on not only “the manner in\nwhich criminal trials are conducted,” the aspect of government of highest\nconcern and importance, Richmond Newspaper, Inc. v.

The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment |\nwith various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the\ncharges—teferred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial |\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. |\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the |\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to |\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor. |\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the |\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a |\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage |\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four |\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges |\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same. |\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before |\nshe can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each\nelement of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n!\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo76o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010778.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document688 _ Filed o6/29/22 Page 25 of 353\nJuror ID: Q\nIf no or unsure, please explain: |\n| | NATURE OF CHARGES |\n42.

STERNHEIA\\\n\nwitnesses, including potential FRE 4o4(b) witnesses, and trial exhibits, the government’s\nspeculation about the length of the trial is entirely one-sided and lacking in any reliable estimate\nof a defense case. The government’s April l2\" disclosure of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference. Counsel\nhave other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follou the\nsummer trial of this case. These commitments make us unavailable from September through\nDecember, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,\nbefore mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, have not yet been setled. Yesterday, we met with the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020313.jpg": "Cas6dse@- trai S2osaTentDGcWAErW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, F7Age Rage of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July l2th, carving off any time\nrequired for trial preparation is unwarranted and unfair.\n\nA continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. The new charges\nup the ante and double Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance\nundercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A\ncontinuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and\nnecessary in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.\nDespite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell\n\nA delay of the July l2 trial especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial\nschedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued\ndetention, the details of which are well knoun to the Court. In addition to her prolonged\ndetention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat\nfair and impartial jurors.\n\nOn April 26\", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and\nmay moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to\nseek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit’s decision.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020393.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page/7 of 9l\n\no7/o6/2o2o Rule 5(c)(3) Documents Received as to Ghislaine Maxwell from the United States\nDistrict Court — District of New Hampshire.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

(Comey,\nMaurene) (Entered: ll/l2/2o2l)\n\nll/l2/2o2l | 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's leter\nmotion seeking clarification on two items from the November l, 2o2l pretrial\nconference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed\norder regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November l8,\n2o2l. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and in court throughout the process by\ntheir assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed\nto defense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective\njurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,\nbut not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.\nLists for questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email\nby November l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5\nat 9:3o a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The\nCourt will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence\nof the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides\nindicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain\ncircumstances. See Transcript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider\nproposed narrouly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a\ncase—by—case basis. See id. at l2. The Court will decide in due course whether the\nexercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November l9 or November 29. The\nCourt implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this\ncase has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—l9 protocols.\nThese procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties\nand prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,\nimpartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of\ncriminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the request to seal the parties' proposed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire and the\nCourt's draft <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is\ndenied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to\nensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol,\n232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed\nand draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435\nF.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed\nto carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial\nmedia. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's\nconsideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors\nrelated to this case and upcoming trial.

The Court will\nprovide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on\nNovember l6 at the commencement of voir dire.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification\nabout the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United\nStates v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the\nGovernment identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus\nthe Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on\ncross—examination. As the Court noted at the November l conference, the Defendant\nmay not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment\nmay be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. l, 2o2l Transcript at\nll-l2.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 5ol,\n5ll-l2 (l984)). Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,\naccompanying exhibits, and their January l3 leters, by February 25, 2o22. The Court\nwill docket Juror 5o's motion. As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly\nunsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

(jbo) (Entered: lo/25/2o2l)\n\nlo/22/2o2l 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's\nconference, the Court will implement the follouing procedures for jury selection: A\nscreening <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> will be administered on November 4, 5, and l2. The Clerk's\nOffice will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.\nThe list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.\nJurors will be identified on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and in court throughout the process by their\nassigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to\ndefense counsel by the U.S. Atorney's Office. After reviewing the completed\nquestionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors\nthat both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense, but not\nthe Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires\ncompleted on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7. Lists\nfor questionnaires completed on November l2 will be due to the Court via email by\nNovember l3. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November l5 at 9:3o\na.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November l6-l9. The Court will\nconduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties\nand with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the\npotential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See\nTranscript at loll. As the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrouly tailored\nmeasures that may be necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at l2.\nThe Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will\nproceed on November l9 or November 29. The Court implements these procedures\ntaking into account the significant publicity this case has garnered, the nature of the\ncharges, and the District's COVID-l9 protocols. These procedures are carefully balanced\nand tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light of the\ncontinuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the\nFirst Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons\nstated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire and the Court's draft <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire until after\njury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to\nimplement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see\nDkt. Nos. 28, 8l, 95, 99, lol, 232, 24l, 284, 3ol, 3l5, the defense did not justify sealing\nthe entirety of the proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). The Court's planned individual\nvoir dire process is designed to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential\ninfluence of any pre-trial media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to\npropose for the Court's consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of\nthe specific factors related to this case and upcoming trial.

The revision to question ll reflects the Court's oral\nruling on November l, 2o2l regarding the use of pseudonyms for certain witnesses. The\nrevisions to questions 9, l3, l4, l5, 2o, 2l, and 33 are non-substantive changes to\nquestion numbers in order to accurately reference the corresponding question numbers on\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> or are grammatical changes.

Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about\nthe line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses\ntestifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to\npermissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the\nDefendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States\nv. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2oo8). The line of questioning the Government\nidentifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not\nlimit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the\nCourt noted at the November l conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a\nspecific employer, but the type and genre of employment may be relevant to the jury's\nassessment of credibilty.

The Government subsequently submited one court exhibit with the name\nunredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.\n58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.\nThe Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will ensure that\nthe First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the\nCourt must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues\nin order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one\nbe ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,\ninterest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing\nshould themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can\nbe made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or\nredaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the\npublic docket on or before February l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by\nreference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d\nCir. 2oo6). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification\nleter on or before February 4, 2o22. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new\ntrial motion is due February 2, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. Per the established practice in this\ncase, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense\nthe opportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,\nwhich is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l. If redactions or sealing are proposed, the\nDefense leter justifying such requests would be due February l5, 2o22, and the\nGovernment leter would be due February l8, 2o22. The parties are FURTHER\nORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal the filled-out\nquestionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583.

Because of the important\ninterest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is\nhigh. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard\nfor holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to\nrespond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual\nabuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple\nmedia outlets about his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that\ncast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial\nstatements are \"clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,\nnon-speculative impropriety\"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.\nUnited States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential\nimpropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the\njury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could\nbe explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is\nnot met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a\nhearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request\nfor a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a\nhearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 5o under oath. The Court further\nORDERS that Juror 5o's <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the\nOpinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy of his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nand a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will\nconduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant\nand the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance\nwith the Opinion & Order on or before March l, 2o22. The hearing will take place on\nMarch 8, 2o22, at lo:oo a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 5o to appear in Courtroom 9o6\nof the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 4o Centre Street, New York, New\nYork at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's\nquestions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public\naccess as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &\nOrder to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2o22, the parties are ORDERED to inform\nthe Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming\nany requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt.

The Court's\nChambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to docket three\njoint leters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not\ndocketed. Because docketing the leters would not undermine the important interest of\nprotecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties are ORDERED to docket the three\nleters on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22. Finally, to ensure a complete\nrecord, the Court has identified four additional documents that have not previously been\ndocketed nor subject of a sealing request: November l9, 2o2l Administrator Feldman's\nMotion to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits November 22, 2o2l\nDefendant's Response to Motions to Quash Defendant's Rule l7(c)(3) subpoena\nDecember 6, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Call Counsel to Testify\nDecember l5, 2o2l Jane's Opposition to Defendant's December l3, 2o2l Motion to Call\nCounsel to Testify The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for\nthe relevant movants and indicate on or before l2:oo p.m. on Friday, July l5, 2o22,\nwhether there are any requests to seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any\ndocuments not subject to a sealing request must be docketed on ECF by that same date.\nAny proposed redactions must be justified by reference to the three-part test articulated\nby the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.

Because of the important interest in the finality of\njudgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and\nthe Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding a post-verdict evidentiary\nhearing is met as to whether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection\nprocess to whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several\ndirect, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do not\npertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury\nselection. Juror 5o’s post-trial statements are “clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible\nevidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely, a false statement during jury\nselection—has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23, l3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear,\nthe potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on\nthe jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury\nselection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be\nexplored.\n\nIn contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect\nto the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and\npre-hearing discovery.\n\nThe Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at which the Court will question\nJuror 5o under oath. The Court further ORDERS that Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> be unsealed, for\nthe reasons explained in the Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 5o a copy\nof his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and a copy of this Order.

NATHAN, Circuit Judge, siting by designation:\n\nCentral to our system of justice is a defendant’s right to have guilt adjudged by a lay jury\nof one’s peers. Citizens give their time and atention to this critical role in the administration of\njustice, a role which is enshrined in our Constitution. Judicial officers are charged with the\nimplementation of this constitutional right. In all cases, whether of high profile or lou, trial\ncourts must ensure that only jurors who can fairly and impartially assess the evidence are seated\non the jury. And once seated, the jury must be permited to deliberate fully and frankly in an\neffort to reach a unanimous verdict. Trials entail significant investments of public and private\nresources. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 555 (l984). For all of\nthese reasons, a verdict may be set aside only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33 on the basis that a juror provided inaccurate information during jury\nselection. Maxwell contends the juror’s presence on the jury violated her Sixth Amendment\nright to an impartial jury. Bearing these principles in mind, the Court conducted an uncommon\npost-trial hearing. Although uncommon, the hearing was necessary because of incontrovertible\nevidence that Juror 5o failed to respond accurately during the jury selection process to a question\non a writen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> about his history of sexual abuse. At the hearing, the Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o944\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020946.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel2o of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3 of 4o\n\nHis tone, demeanor, and responsiveness gave no indication of false testimony. The Court thus\ncredits his testimony that he was distracted as he filled out the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and “skimmed way\ntoo fast,” leading him to misunderstand some of the questions. Assuming mistakenly that he\nwould not be one of the twelve jurors selected from the hundreds of prospective jurors who had.\nbeen summoned, he rushed through the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. This led to inaccurate answers. Juror 5o’s\nlack of atention and care in responding accurately to every question on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is\nregretable, but the Court is confident that the failure to disclose was not deliberate.\n\nThe Court further finds that Juror 5o was not biased and would not have been stricken for\ncause even if he had answered each question on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> accurately. At the hearing, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o the same set of questions that it asked of all prospective jurors who had\nindicated prior experience with sexual abuse on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. These questions are typical of\nhou trial court judges seek to assess potential bias and determine—based on the juror’s\nresponses—whether the juror should be struck for cause. This is so because the key question is\nnot simply whether an individual has had experiences similar to the issues that will be explored\nat trial, but whether the individual can serve fairly and impartially.\n\nThis Court has presided over a murder trial in which a juror who had a family member\nmurdered was not struck for cause. So too victims of fraud serve faithfully in fraud trials and\nindividuals who have been discriminated against serve fairly in discrimination cases. And\nsurvivors of rape have and can serve impartially in trials charging the crime of rape. In this case,\nJuror 5o’s responses at the hearing to the questions regarding his ability to be a fair and impartial\njuror, even in light of his past experience of sexual abuse, established that he too could serve\nfairly and impartially. Thus, this Court would not have struck Juror 5o for cause if he had\nprovided accurate responses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o946\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020947.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel2l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 4 of 4o\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Jury Selection Process\n\nThe jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of\nprospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of\nNew York’s COVID-l9 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,\ncourt staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in\nthree stages: a writen pre-screen <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the\nexercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and voir dire with input\nfrom the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nwas designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s\nlength and schedule, a juror’s personal knouledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s\nawareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a\nresult of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 2l, 2o2l Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus\non appropriate follou-up questions based on <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> responses, additional questions more\nappropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed\nperemptory challenges. Jd. at 7.\n\nWhen prospective jurors arrived to complete the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and when they returned\nfor voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those\ninstructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 4o4, 427. These instructions briefly\nexplained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same\nlanguage that the parties proposed for the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>), and instructed jurors not to discuss\nthe case or consume any media about the case.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o947\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020948.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel22 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 5 of 4o\n\nThe final <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> contained 5l questions, although multiple questions required\nfollou-up responses for certain answers. Dkt. No. 462. Questions 25, 48, and 49 asked about a\nprospective juror’s experience with crime and sexual abuse, harassment, and assault.\n\nQuestion 25 asked: “Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a\nvictim of a crime?,” and provided three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),” “Yes\n(friend or family member),” and “No.” /d. at l3. Question 25a then asked: “If yes, is there\nanything about that experience that would prevent you from acting as a fair and impartial juror in\nthis case?,” and provided two answer options: “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 25b asked: “If\nyes to 25a, please explain.” Several lines were then provided for the prospective juror to explain\ntheir answer. /d.\n\nQuestion 48 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted sexual assault or other\n\nunwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or\n\nfamily member).\nId. at 24. Like Question 25, there were three answer options in the follouing order: “Yes (self),”\n“Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” Question 48a next asked: “If yes, without listing\nnames, please explain.” Space was provided to write an answer. Question 48b asked: “If your\nanswer to 48 was yes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and\nimpartially as a juror in this case?” There were two answer choices: “Yes” and “No.” Finally,\nQuestion 48c asked: “If yes to 48b, please explain.” Like Question 48a, several lines of space\nwere provided to answer the question. /d.\n\nFinally, Question 49 asked:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual\n\nabuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of law or\n\ninformal accusations in a social or work seting of actual or atempted sexual assault or\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o948\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020949.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel23 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 6 of 4o\n\nother unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\n\nteacher, or family member.).\nId. at 25.

Question 49a asked:\n“Tf yes, without listing names, please explain.” Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was\nyes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in\nthis case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b,\nplease explain.” /d. The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\ncompromise of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nTd. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020950.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel24 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 7 of 4o\n\nAs a result of this process, 23l prospective jurors were selected to return for in-person\nquestioning for voir dire. Id. at 4. At this second stage of selection, the Court questioned.\nprospective jurors one-on-one due to “Covid-related space limitations, to streamline the process\nin light of a likelihood of a high number of sidebars which would otherwise be required, and to\nensure that the comments of one juror [did] not infect the pool.” /d. at 8.

Juror 5o’s jury selection process\n\nJuror 5o completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> on the morning of November 4, 2o2l—the first\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> session. Mar. 8, 2o22 Hearing Tr. at 7. In his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Juror 5o checked\n“No” for Question 25. Hearing Exhibit l at l3, Dkt. No. 638 (hereinafter “<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>”). He\nleft Questions 25a and 25b blank. For Question 48, he checked the box “No.” /d. at 24. He left\nQuestions 48a, 48b, and 48c blank. Finally, Juror 5o checked “No” for Question 49. Jd. at 25.\nHe left Questions 49a, 49b, and 49c blank.\n\nJuror 5o was among the prospective jurors the parties agreed should proceed to voir dire.\nHe returned for in-person questioning on November l6, 2o2l. Consistent with other prospective\njurors who had answered “No” to Questions 25, 48, and 49, the Court did not ask Juror 5o any\nfollou-up questions on these issues. Houever, the Court did ask Juror 5o about his background,\nwhether he would follou the Court’s instructions, and his prior knouledge of the Defendant and\nJeffrey Epstein, among other questions. Juror 5o explained that he had seen a news article on\nCNN, but he could “absolutely” decide the case “based on the facts and evidence, or lack of\nevidence, here presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l3o; see also id. at l3l\n(indicating that he had “no doubt” as to his ability to put his prior knouledge aside).

Juror 5o\nreplied, “No” and affirmed that he did not have “any reason to think that [he] can’t be fair and\nimpartial here.” /d. at l34.\n\nOn November 29, the parties exercised their peremptory strikes. The Defendant used all\nof her strikes. See Nov. 29, 2o2l Trial Tr. at 73l-32. Juror 5o was one of fifty-eight qualified\nprospective jurors, and he was ultimately one of the twelve deliberating jurors. /d. at 733.\n\nC. Juror 5o’s post-verdict interviews and party response\n\nFollouing the thirteen-day trial, the jury began deliberations on December 2o, 2o2l.

No. 593 at 29-3o.\n\nA week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the Government\ninformed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to press outlets\nabout his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater. Dkt. No. 568. The leter\nnoted that in the interviews, which were both in print and on video, the juror “described being a\nvictim of sexual abuse” and asserted that he “flew through” the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and did not\nrecall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at l.

In an\nOpinion & Order dated February 25, 2o22, the Court denied the Defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial on the current record and determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the motion.\nThe Court ordered an evidentiary hearing limited to instances supported by clear, strong, and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety had occurred—namely, a\nfalse statement during jury selection. The hearing was also limited by Federal Rule of Evidence\n6o6, which bars the Court from receiving evidence of a juror’s statements regarding what\noccurred during jury deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 6o6(b)(l). Accordingly, the evidentiary\nhearing was limited to “whether Juror 5o provided false answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the\nexplanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have responded to follou-up questions if\naccurate answers had been provided” during the jury selection process.

The Court also rejected many of the Defendant’s\nproposed lines of questions. The parties were also permited to propose follou-up questions at\nthe hearing in light of the Court’s questioning and Juror 5o’s responses. The Court accepted\nsome of these proposals and rejected others.\n\nJuror 5o testified that his answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not accurate. He\nexplained that when he was nine and ten years old, he was abused on multiple occasions by a\nstepbrother, who he no longer considered part of the family, and one of the stepbrother’s friends.\nHearing Tr. at 8.

He similarly acknouledged that “yes (self)” would have\nbeen correct to Question 25; although at the time of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he understood the question\nto be asking about being “robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like that.” /d. at 9-lo.\n\nJuror 5o testified that these incorrect answers were an inadvertent mistake and that he had\nnot intentionally failed to disclose his personal history of sexual abuse. /d. at l4-l6, 22-23.

It took several hours to start\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> after a long security line and technical issues with the Court’s instructional\nvideo. His mind was preoccupied with a recent romantic breakup and the commotion at the\nnearby check-out table. He saw other prospective jurors completing their questionnaires and\nrushed to finish.

Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\nirrelevant or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt.

See Tanner, 483 U.S. at l2o-2l.\n\nFinally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have\nexercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual\nabuse. Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a\nnew trial because Juror 5o’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise\nher peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court. Indeed, in making this argument\nshe cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. But the rule\nin New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See State v. Scher, 65o\nA.2d lol2, lol9-2o (N.J. App. Div. l994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its\nfederal counterpart” of McDenough).

A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the\nperemptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l6 (concluding\nthat a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may\ncertainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for\narguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause’).

McDonough Prong One\n\nThe Court begins with what Juror 5o’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing makes plain:\n\nJuror 5o provided inaccurate answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. For each\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020959.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel33 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l6 of 4o\nof these questions, Juror 5o answered “No” on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, but testified that the correct\nanswer would have been “Yes (self)” for Questions 25 and 48 and “Yes (friend or family\nmember)” for Question 49. Hearing Tr. at 7-l2. Those three inaccurate answers all stem from\nJuror 5o’s failure to disclose that he was sexually abused as a child. Under the Defendant’s\ninterpretation of McDenough, that would be sufficient to satisfy the first prong. But the\nGovernment’s interpretation requires that the Court make a further finding that the inaccurate\nanswers were made deliberately.\n\nAfter close consideration of the record, including Juror 5o’s testimony under oath, the\nCourt concludes that Juror 5o’s answers to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, while incorrect, were not\ndeliberately inaccurate. Rather, for the reasons that follou, the Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, misread the relevant questions, and\nprovided inadvertently inaccurate responses. /d. at l2.\n\nAs a preliminary mater, Juror 5o testified under oath pursuant to a grant of immunity.\nId. at 5. He faces the possibility of perjury charges if he testified falsely at the hearing. Juror 5o\ntherefore had a strong incentive to testify truthfully.\n\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s testimony in light of his demeanor in testifying\nunder oath. At the hearing, the Court was able to closely observe Juror 5o as he testified and to\nassess his reaction to questions, including those he appeared not to expect, as well as to the\noverall tone of his answers. Juror 5o answered the Court’s questions in a calm and\nstraightforward manner. He was apologetic for his carelessness. His tone, demeanor, and\nresponsiveness gave no indication of false testimony.\n\nFurther, Juror 5o’s answers to the Court’s questions were logical explanations and\ngenerally internally consistent. He testified that his atention to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was distracted\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o959\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020960.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel34 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l7 of 4o\nby several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security\nline, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering\nquestions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a\nromantic relationship. /d. at l4 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was siting there\ntwiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and\nsiting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his\nother hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See\nNov. l6, 2o2l Voir Dire Tr. at l33 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t\nwant to see anything regarding them”).\n\nDistractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Juror 5o\ntestified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed\nquestionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at\nthat table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt\nrushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Hearing Tr. at l8.\nMoreover, the Court credits Juror 5o’s candid admission that he was not concerned with\nfollouing the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had\nconcluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were\nthere.” /d. at l3, l8; see also id. at 4o.\n\nThis explanation coheres with Juror 5o’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not\na salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. He repeatedly\ntestified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at l6, 22. The\nsummary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the\nDefendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020961.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel35 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l8 of 4o\n\nsexual activity” and “sex trafficking of a minor,” did not cause him to think of his oun sexual\nabuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span> at 4. The Court finds that explanation to be reasonable.\n\nLast, the Court finds Juror 5o’s explanation that his answers were made inadvertently to\nbe the most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly after trial, Juror 5o readily\ndisclosed the fact of his sexual abuse in several media interviews in which he used his real first\nname and pictures of himself. Finding that Juror 5o intentionally provided false answers on the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> requires concluding that he willingly disclosed his deliberate and unlawful\ndeception in public interviews. The more likely explanation for Juror 5o’s behavior is the one to\nwhich he credibly testified: Juror 5o’s inaccurate answers were provided inadvertently, and he\nwas made aware of his mistake only after he completed his media interviews. That explanation\nis corroborated by a video recording of Juror 5o’s interview with the Daily Mail, which the\nDefendant entered into the record and previously cited in support of her claim for a new trial.\nSee Maxwell Br. at 39-4o. In that video, Juror 5o states that he was asked only about the sexual\nabuse history of his friends and family but not his oun. When the interviewer asks Juror 5o\nabout Question 48 in particular, he appears genuinely and completely surprised to learn that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> included this question. That moment of surprise is consistent with Juror 5o’s\nhearing testimony that this was the moment at which he realized he may have made a serious, but\nhonest, mistake. See Hearing Tr. at l5 (stating that he first learned that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> may\nask about his oun sexual abuse history “during [his] Daily Mail interview with the reporter\nLaura Collins”).\n\nThe Defendant raises several arguments for why the Court should instead find that Juror\n5o commited perjury at the hearing and that his answers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> were intentionally\ninaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. First, the Defendant characterizes much of Juror 5o’s\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o96l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020962.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel36 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l9 of 4o\n\ntestimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, lo, Dkt. No. 649.\nJuror 5o certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with\nwhat any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 5o would\nhave reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for\nanticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 5o’s responses any fabrication or\nimproper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x lo, l2 (2d Cir. 2o2o)\n(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness\ndid “what any reasonable person . . . would do: namely, prepare for questioning at a potentially\nlife-altering hearing”). As for being “self-serving,” as noted above, Juror 5o’s personal interests\nwere served by testifying truthfully at the hearing so as not to face criminal perjury charges.\n\nSecond, the Defendant argues that it is not credible that Juror 5o “did not see the word\n‘you’ and the answer ‘Yes (self)’” for Question 48. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 8. She notes\nthat he answered fifty-two prior questions and follou-up questions with the word “you” and that\nit is not plausible that Question 48 would ask only about friends and family. Yet the Court, in\nseveral lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 5o’s testimony and is\nsatisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 5o that throughout the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nhe “appeared to have folloued the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at l9. When asked hou he\ncorrectly folloued the instructions elsewhere, Juror 5o explained, as he had previously in his\ntestimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he “was still . . . in focus”\nand so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later\nquestions, including Question 48.\n\nAdditionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,\nasking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020963.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel37 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2o of 4o\nyes friend or family, or no.” /d. at l5,2l. Consistent with his explanation that he skimmed the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he testified that he “did not pick up on” that patern when filling out the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, id. at l5, and read only “the friend or family” and “missed that ‘have you,’ and\nthen ‘yes self? while reading,” Question 48, id. at 2l. And when asked a follou-up question,\nJuror 5o said he was not “surprised” at the time, but only surprised “thinking nou” that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family but not about a\njuror’s oun sexual abuse history. /d. at 2l-22. The Court finds that Juror 5o’s answers to each\nof these lines of questioning were reasonable and credible.\n\nThird, the Defendant argues that, as to Question 49, Juror 5o was inconsistent in first\nstating that he was sexually abused by “a family member, who is no longer part of the family,”\nbut then stating that he “never considered [the stepbrother] part of [his] family even when they\nlived with us for a few years.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9-lo (quoting Hearing Tr. at 8, ll).\nThe Court acknouledges the tension between these two statements, but does not agree that\ntension suggests Juror 5o deliberately concealed his stepbrother’s abuse. Juror 5o’s explanation\nof his answer to Question 49 proceeded in three stages. He clarified, first, that on November 4,\nhe “didn’t even consider . . . at all” whether his stepbrother’s conduct was responsive to Question\n49 as he “flew through” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Hearing Tr. at ll-l2. At the hearing, he initially\nstated that “No” was an accurate answer because, as the Defendant notes, he “never considered”\nthe stepbrother to be a member of his family. /d. And finally, when asked whether, “[a]s [he]\nsit[s] here nou,” what his answer to Question 49 would be, Juror 5o said “it would have been\nyes” because “by law, by marriage, that person was [his] stepbrother.” Jd. at l2-l3. In short, it\nwas only after Juror 5o was made to reflect on the question and its answer that he reached an\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020966.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel4o of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 23 of 4o\nJuror 5o “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 5o responded by “thank[ing] her\nfor sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”\nFarmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be\nseen by Juror 5o’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two\nfollouers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twiter. Jd. The Court\nconcludes that Juror 5o’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twiter, made in January 2o22, does not\nprovide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2o2l, he did not tell many\npeople about his sexual abuse.\n\nAt botom, based on Juror 5o’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under\noath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 5o credible. His failure to atend with\ndiligence and care to the questions on the jury selection <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is frustrating and\nregretable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court\nfinds that Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.\n\nB. McDonough Prong Two\n\nAssuming without deciding that Juror 5o’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the\nfirst prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would\nhave excused Juror 5o for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection\naccurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 5o the same set of\nquestions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal\nexperience with sexual abuse. Juror 5o’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the\nhearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate\nresponses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o966\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020970.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel44 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 27 of 4o\nconsidering whether some marginal types of disclosed facts are enough to shou inferable bias—\nask about a juror’s impartiality and might be persuaded by the force of the juror’s assurance.” /d.\nat 47 n.l2. For example, in 7orres, the Second Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded during voir dire that a juror was inferably biased because she had\nengaged in money-structuring activities that were highly similar to the conduct charged in the\ncase. But the Second Circuit made clear that the district court would not have erred if it had kept\nthe juror. Jd. at 46-48.\n\nThe Court concludes that Juror 5o is neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, none\nof the “extreme situations” in which the Court must conclusively presume bias as a mater of law\napply here. McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48. Juror 5o was not a victim of the charged crime itself, nor is\nhe related to any of the atorneys, witnesses, victims, or other case participants. See Nix, 275 F.\nSupp. 3d at 45l. Thus, the Court would not have granted a hypothetical challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias even if Juror 5o had provided correct answers to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o’s personal experience of sexual abuse does not evidence partiality\nsufficient to infer that Juror 5o was biased against the Defendant. The Court need not imagine a\nwholly hypothetical universe for this conclusion. That is because the voir dire provides highly\nrelevant indications of hou the parties and Court would have reacted had Juror 5o provided\naccurate answers during jury selection. A review of the voir dire of jurors who responded “yes\n(selfy’ to Question 48 reveals that it is unlikely that the Defendant would have challenged Juror\n5o for cause. It also reveals that the Court would not have granted a for-cause challenge had one\nbeen raised. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49.\n\nEight prospective jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48 proceeded to voir dire.\nThe Court asked every follou-up question requested by the Defendant with regard to a juror’s\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o97o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020973.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel47 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3o of 4o\nimpartial juror in such a trial. That is not the law, nor should it be. See Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989-9o (loth Cir. l996) (“To hold that no rape victim could ever be an impartial juror\nin a rape trial would, we think, insult not only all rape victims but also our entire jury system.”);\nBuckner v. Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” /d. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the technical issues and ensuing long wait to begin the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36. For the reasons stated in this Court’s February 25 Opinion, that Juror 5o used social media\naccounts after the completion of trial does not establish that he lied about having been inactive on social media\nbefore trial. Feb. 25, 2o2o Op. & Order, at 9-lo.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o973\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020974.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel48 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 3l of 4o\n\naspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to\nbe selected. The Court finds Juror 5o’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and\ndoes not find as a factual mater that Juror 5o deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.\n\nThe Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d l5o (lst Cir. 2ol3), is\nsimilarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll. There, a juror failed to disclose that\nher husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank\nrobbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. Houever, the juror\nhad told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her\ndaughter’s incarceration and her oun substance abuse issues. /d. at l6l-62, l68. By contrast,\nJuror 5o’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>,\nstems only from his experience of sexual abuse.\n\nSecond, the Defendant contends that Juror 5o was biased due to the “similarities between\n[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 3o (quoting\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavous arguing “that every person who has\nbeen a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause\nbased on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at l7. Distancing from that position is necessary—\nagain, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 5o’s personal\nhistory is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied\nbias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 5o’s testimony\nand post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased.

So\nlong as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the\nlaw as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our\njury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.\nex rel.

The Court is unpersuaded. First, at\nthe March 8 hearing, the Court rejected the Defendant’s proposed follou-up questions on\nJuror 5o’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions\nduring the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of\nsexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has\nundergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience\ninterferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 5o credibly testified that his sexual abuse\nis not usually on his mind, that the subject mater would not upset him in a way that would\ndistract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his oun experience in a way that\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o979\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020980.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel54 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 37 of 4o\nwould prevent him from being fair or impartial. As discussed above, the minor discrepancies\nraised by the Defendant do not alter this assessment.”\n\nNor was Juror 5o’s inaccurate answer to Question 25 unreasonable. He testified that he\nunderstood the question to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or some sort of crime like\nthat,” and that he did not think of his history of “sexual abuse as being a victim of a crime.”\nHearing Tr. at lo. Because neither he nor a friend or family member had been robbed or mugged.\nor been the victim of a similar type of crime, he testified, he answered “No” to Question 25.\n\nThat interpretation of what it means to be a victim of a crime, while technically incorrect, does\nnot evince intentional deception or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:ol-CR-l2, 2ol4\nWL 36978lo, at *7, *l3 (D. Vt. July 24, 2ol4) (crediting the explanation of a juror that was\nsexually abused as a child that she “ha[d] not considered [herself] a victim of a crime in all these\nyears” in part because the abuser was “not convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 U.S at\n555 (“[JJurors are not necessarily experts in English usage. Called as they are from all walks of\nlife, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by\nlawyers and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly interpreted Question 25 to\nnot refer to uncharged incidents of sexual abuse. For example, Juror C disclosed being ‘i\nee.” in response to Question 48, but in response to Question\n25, reported only that a family member was mugged. See Juror C <span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>.\nIn sum, the Court concludes that Juror 5o is not impliedly or inferably biased.\n° The Defendant also notes that Juror 5o apparently posted on social media about atending therapy to help “deal[]\nwith the stress of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br. at 2o. It is perfectly\nreasonable for a juror to go to therapy and use of such services does not disqualify a citizen from service. In fact,\ncourts in this district routinely make counseling services available to jurors follouing the completion of a trial.\n37\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o98o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020981.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel55 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 38 of 4o\n3. The Court rejects the Defendant’s additional post-hearing argument\nthat Juror 5o was biased because he failed to follou instructions.\n\nIn her post-hearing briefing, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s testimony that he was\n“absolutely not” concerned with follouing the Court’s instructions when filling out the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> is an additional ground for concluding that Juror 5o was unable to serve as an\nunbiased juror. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at ll-l2 (quoting Hearing Tr. at l8). The Court\ndisagrees.\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony established that his lack of diligence was limited to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> session. Juror 5o shoued up for trial on time every day and appeared to the Court\nthat he was atentive throughout trial. There is no indication that Juror 5o failed to follou this\nCourt’s instructions during voir dire, trial, or deliberations. Juror 5o explained that he was\nunconcerned with follouing the Court’s instructions while completing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> because\nhe was “super distracted” and believed that there was no possibility that he would be selected for\nthe jury. Hearing Tr. at 4o. Voir dire, he testified, was a “different situation.” Jd. at4l. When\nhe answered the Court’s questions in person at voir dire, he had not been “siting there for\nhours . . . thinking about [his] ex.” /d. He felt confident that he accurately answered all of the\nCourt’s questions. This included affirming that he was able to follou the Court’s instructions as\nto the presumption of innocence and the law generally, the prohibition on consuming media on\nthe case or any other extraneous information, and his ability to put any prior knouledge to the\nside and decide the case based on the evidence, or lack of evidence, presented at trial. Voir Dire\nTr. at l28-3l. Under oath, he testified that although he “can become distracted,” that “had no\neffect” on him serving and “listening to all the evidence given during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at\n4l. The Court confirmed that Juror 5o “carefully” folloued the Court’s instructions during voir\ndire and trial.

She relies on Dyer v. Calderon,\nl5l F.3d 97o (9th Cir. l998) (en banc), as her sole support. But Dyer stands for the distinct\nproposition that a juror who deliberately lies, and thus commits perjury, cannot be trusted to\n“stand in judgment of other people’s veracity.” /d. at 983. It does not support that an uncareful\nand inatentive prospective juror who mistakenly provides an inaccurate response during jury\nselection is biased. As explained above, the Court does not conclude that Juror 5o commited\nperjury and lied in an effort to be on the jury. Accordingly, the Court rejects granting the\nDefendant’s motion on this basis.\n\neK\n\nIn sum, the Court concludes that the evidence in the record does not support finding that\nJuror 5o was biased. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony did not reveal actual partiality. And Juror 5o\nwas not impliedly or inferably biased. He was neither a victim nor otherwise involved in the\nactual crimes. Nor does he have any sort of relationship with any of the parties or case\nparticipants. And as consistent with other jurors who answered “yes (self)” to Question 48, the\nCourt would not have granted a for-cause challenge on the basis of Juror 5o’s personal history of\nsexual abuse. That Juror 5o was distracted during the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> does not reveal that he was\nbiased or failed to follou the Court’s instructions during voir dire and the trial. Prong two of the\ndemanding McDonough inquiry is not satisfied.\nIV.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nBefore the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure 33, which the Government opposes. See Maxwell Br., Jan. l9, 2o22; Gov.\nBr., Feb. 2, 2o22. The Defendant seeks a new trial on the basis that Juror 5o “falsely answered a\nmaterial question during voir dire and . . . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been\nsubject to a challenge for cause.” Maxwell Br. at 48. The Defendant contends that the current\npaper record sufficiently supports her motion and should be granted without a hearing. /d. In\nthe alternative the Defendant requests an evidentiary hearing to inquire into Juror 5o’s alleged\nnondisclosure. She also argues a broader hearing is required based on a news article that\nsuggests a second juror was allegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 49. The Government urges\nthis Court to deny the Defendant’s motion on the current record, but it consents to a limited\nhearing on the issue of whether Juror 5o provided a materially false answer to Question 48 of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Gov. Br. at 3l-32.\n\nThe Defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the current record is DENIED.\nDefendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 5o\nregarding what occurred during jury deliberations that the Court is prohibited from considering\nunder Rule 6o6. With regard to Juror 5o’s statements that do not pertain to jury deliberations, in\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021526.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 35o 3536o39, Page96 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 2 of 2l\norder to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn\nstatements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available\non the current record.\n\nAccordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court\nconcludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an\nevidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. The\nCourt further concludes that Juror 5o’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.\nFollouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets\nabout his oun experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the\naccuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial\nand incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false\nstatement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that\nsomeone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential\nfailure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding\nstandard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 5o’s use of social media nor\nthe conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the\nCourt will question Juror 5o under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-\nhearing discovery is DENIED.\n\nI. Background\n\nOn December 29, 2o2l, the jury returned a verdict in this case, finding the Defendant\nguilty of five counts. A week after the jury announced its verdict, on January 5, 2o22, the\nGovernment informed the Court that a juror had given at least three post-verdict interviews to\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l526\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021527.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35l 3536o39, Page97 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 3 of 2l\n\npress outlets about his jury service and requested a hearing be held on the mater.

The Government\nopposed the motion on February 2, 2o22, and the Defendant filed a reply in support on February\n9, 2o22.

For completeness of the record, the Court notes the follouing occurred also on January 5, 2o22: The Jury\nDepartment of the Southern District of New York received a call from Juror 5o asking for guidance because of\nstatements he had given to certain media outlets that were being widely reported on in the press and inquiring\nwhether he needed an atorney. At the Court’s direction, the District Executive returned Juror 5o’s call and\ninformed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question. Juror 5o then asked the\nDistrict Executive if he could access his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. The District Executive, again at the Court’s direction,\ninformed Juror 5o that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> was not a public document and could not be provided to him.\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l527\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021528.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 359 3536o39, Page98 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 4 of 2l\nsexually abused as a child” as a basis for a broader hearing beyond inquiry into Juror 5o.\nMaxwell Br. at 2l, 49.\nII.

July\n3, 2ol9), aff'd, 24 F.4th l44 (2d Cir. 2o22). “[E]ven though there are additional\nconsiderations . . . when ruling on an evidentiary hearing and new trial motion premised upon\nallegations of juror misconduct, these are the overarching legal standards applicable to all Rule\n33 motions, including when juror misconduct is at issue.” /d.\n\nIf a hearing is held, “its scope should be limited to only what is absolutely necessary to\ndetermine the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “Therefore, in the course of a\npost-verdict inquiry ..., when and if it becomes apparent that the above-described reasonable\ngrounds to suspect prejudicial jury impropriety do not exist, the inquiry should end.” Moon, 7l8\nF.2d at l234. The Court has discretion to structure the hearing and to determine what testimony\nis needed. Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544.\n\nB. The scope of the hearing\n\nThe Court will conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether Juror 5o provided false\nanswers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, the explanation for those answers, and hou Juror 5o would have\nresponded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided. The Government\nacknouledges that Juror 5o’s answer to Question 48 satisfies the demanding standard for an\nevidentiary hearing under McDonough. Gov. Br. at 33. The Court agrees. Question 48 asked\njurors:\n\nHave you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l53l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021533.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagelo3 of 2l7\nSA-357\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page 9 of 2l\n\nThe potential impropriety that warrants a hearing is not that someone with a history of\nsexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is Juror 5o’s potential failure to respond\ntruthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for such material information\nso that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing limited\nin scope to Juror 5o’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.\n\nC. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into Juror 5o’s social media\n\nThe parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 5o\nanswered falsely the Court’s questions about social media usage during voir dire. To the extent\nthat the Defendant seeks a hearing to probe Juror 5o’s answers to voir dire about his social media\nusage, her arguments are based on speculation, and she has failed to make the high shouing\nrequired. See Baker, 899 F.3d at l3o. At voir dire, when asked if he “use[s] social media,” Juror\n5o stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because I just got out of a relationship and I\ndidn’t want to see anything regarding them. So I am fully off of it right nou.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr.\nat l33. The Court then asked, “What did you use, Facebook, Twiter?” to which Juror 5o replied\n“Facebook and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.”\nTd.\n\nThe screenshots proffered by the Defendant do not demonstrate that any of these answers\nimplicate McDonough. First, Juror 5o did not deny having a Twiter account. Second, Juror\n5o’s account had only | follouer and folloued only 39 people, which corroborates that his\nTwiter use was, at most, relatively minimal. See Maxwell Br. at l7. Third, the fact that Juror\n5o’s Twiter account was opened in April 2o2l and that he used it again in January 2o22, after\nthe completion of the trial, is consistent with Juror 5o’s answer that he deleted his social media\naccounts, or just the social media applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l533\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021542.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagell2 of 2l7\nSA-366\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 62o Filed o2/25/22 Page l8 of 2l\nmust be “limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 544. The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications\nbetween Juror 5o and unknoun persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 5o’s answers\nto the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire. Nor has the Defendant\nexplained why Juror 5o’s receipt of financial payment for interviews after the trial, if true, would\nbe probative of his inclination to not disclose at voir dire prior to trial. The Court will not grant\nthe Defendant “the opportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234\n(quoting Moten, 582 F.2d at 667).\n\nMoreover, the Defendant’s requested subpoenas directed at social media companies who\nhave custody of Juror 5o’s communications, comments, and posts are procedurally improper.\nThose requests for social media content are subject to the Stored Communications Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§§ 27ol-ll, which requires an additional factual shouing for the Court to order disclosure, see 2\nWayne LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure §§ 4.8(b), 4.8(d) (4th ed. 2o2l); Mater of Warrant to\nSearch a Certain E-Mail Acct. Controlled & Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 829 F.3d l97, 2o6\n(2d Cir. 2ol6), vacated and remanded on other grounds, l38 S. Ct. ll86 (2ol8). And only the\nGovernment, not private parties like the Defendant, may request disclosure pursuant to the Act.\nUnited States v. Nix, 25l F.

Wint, l99 A.3d 625, 629 (D.C. 2ol9) (collecting cases). Though the\nGovernment raised the Act in its briefing, the Defendant does not acknouledge it or purport to\nshou she is entitled to make a request.

The Court will release Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\n\nThis Court previously reserved ruling on Juror 5o’s request that the Court release his jury\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under seal to protect his\nsupposed privacy interest. See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.l. The Defendant opposes both the unsealing\nand releasing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will\nundoubt[edly] color Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture.” Maxwell Br. at 53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in\nlimiting Juror 5o’s access and opposes maintaining the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> under seal. Gov. Br. at 42;\nsee also Dkt. No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his completed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his completed <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> must be docketed. Juror 5o’s and the Defendant’s request that the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nremain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). See Dkt. No. 596 at 2 (outlining the\ntest). First, the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> easily qualifies as a judicial document.

For the reasons stated in this Court’s prior order, this\npresumption of access is not outweighed by the possibility of media interest in the document.\nSee Dkt. No. 596 at 3.

Superior Ct. of Cal., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984), has at least been greatly\ndiminished, if not extinguished, since his public comments. The Court further notes that\nprospective jurors had the opportunity to request that particular <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> answers remain\nconfidential; Juror 5o did not make any such request.

After an exten-\nsive hearing, Judge Nathan concluded that the juror’s\nerror was inadvertent, and in any event, she would not\nhave struck the juror for cause had he answered those\nquestion accurately because he was not biased in any\nway against Maxwell and was qualified to serve as a\njuror. Judge Nathan therefore found that Maxwell\nfailed to meet the high bar for a new trial and denied\nher motion. This Court should affirm that careful de-\ntermination.\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\nl. The Jury Selection Process\n\nIn November 2o2l, in advance of trial, 694 jurors\ncompleted a juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> approved by the Dis-\ntrict Court. (Dkt.529 at 2). The juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>\nwas 29 pages and consisted of 5l questions, many of\nwhich contained subparts. (A.29o-3l7). After the par-\nties reviewed the questionnaires, 23l of the 694 pro-\nceeded to voir dire. (Dkt.529 at 2-4). The District Court\nthen examined prospective jurors, asking them about\nquestions in the jury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that prospective\njurors had answered affirmatively. The District Court\nasked the prospective jurors whether the information\nor experiences resulting in the affirmative answer\nwould interfere with their ability to be fair and impar-\ntial.\n\nAt the conclusion of voir dire, the District Court\nqualified 58 jurors. (Voir Dire Tr.7l7). Of the 58 indi-\nviduals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight in-\ndividuals responded to Question 48 of the juror ques-\ntionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021711.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page64 of 93\n5l\n\nsexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,\nand that this experience would not affect their ability\nto serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.\n(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.l8, 52, 2oo, 2o7, 259, 293, 532,\n538-39, 635). Each confirmed that he or she could be\nfair and impartial, and defense counsel did not move\nto strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer\nto Question 48. (A.345).\n\nFor instance, one juror said that she was “sexually\nmolested by an uncle when she was l2 or l8,” but that\nwould not affect her ability to be fair and impartial in\nthe case. (A.345). Another juror indicated that she had\nrecently “reported that a friend was being coerced and\nsexually abused by a professor,” but confirmed that ex-\nperience would not “in any way interfere with her abil-\nity to be fair and impartial” in this case. (/d.). Neither\nthe Government nor defense counsel challenged those\njurors for cause.\n\nThe parties then exercised their peremptory\nstrikes, and a jury was seated.\n\n2. Juror 5o\n\nJuror 5o completed the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> and was\nquestioned by Judge Nathan during voir dire. In his\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Juror 5o repeatedly made clear that he\ncould be fair and impartial. In response to Question l3,\n\nl2 Twelve of the 58 qualified prospective jurors in-\ndicated that a friend or family member had been a vic-\ntim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual as-\nsault.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021712.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page65 of 93\n52\n\nhe indicated that he could decide the case “based solely\non the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court,\nand not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-\npathy, or prejudice.” (A.295). He also accepted the\nprinciple that the law provides that a defendant in a\ncriminal case is presumed innocent and the Govern-\nment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. (A.294). Juror 5o indicated that there was noth-\ning about the nature of the case and the accusations as\nsummarized in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> that might make it\ndifficult for him to be fair and impartial. (A.3o8; see\nalso A.3lo). He repeated these assurances at oral voir\ndire. (See Voir Dire Tr.l28-34).\n\nJuror 5o checked the “no” box in response to Ques-\ntion 48, which asked whether he or a friend or family\nmember had ever been the victim of sexual harass-\nment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. (A.3lo). He also\nchecked the “no” box in response to the question of\nwhether he or any of his relatives or close friends had\never been a victim of a crime. (A.299).\n\nJuror 5o was seated. Follouing the verdict, he dis-\ncussed his experience as a juror during interviews with\nmultiple journalists. During these interviews, Juror 5o\nstated that he was a survivor of childhood sexual\nabuse, which he did not disclose until high school, and\nthat his experience of sexual abuse did not affect his\nability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven\nguilty. (A.249). He also stated that he did not recall the\ndetails of the juror <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, which he “flew\nthrough,” but he believed he answered the questions\nhonestly. (A.245, 262).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021714.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page67 of 93\n54\n\nsexual harassment or abuse), and 49 (whether he or a\nfriend or family member had been accused of sexual\nharassment or abuse). He explained that, when he was\nnine or ten years old, he was sexually abused by a step-\nbrother, who he no longer considered part of the fam-\nily, and the stepbrother’s friend. He explained that he\nanswered Question 49 “no” because he no longer con-\nsidered the stepbrother part of his family, although he\nshould have answered “yes.” He also acknouledged\nthat he should have answered “yes” to Question 25 be-\ncause he was a crime victim, although he read the\nquestion at the time to inquire about robbery, mug-\nging, or similar crimes. (A.267-68).\n\nJuror 5o also testified that his failure to disclose\nthis experience was an inadvertent mistake. He ex-\nplained that he “completely skimmed way too fast”\nwhen completing the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. (A.27o-7l). He did\nso, he explained, in light of the context: he started the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> after several hours’ waiting in security\nlines and after technical issues with the instructions.\nHe was preoccupied with his oun recent romantic\nbreakup and with disruptions in the jury room. And he\nrushed to complete his <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> because he\nthought it virtually impossible that he would be se-\nlected as a juror given the number of people complet-\ning the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. He did not generally think\nabout his personal history of sexual abuse, and it did\nnot occur to him while carelessly speeding through the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>. (A.269-72).\n\nAt oral voir dire, Juror 5o had not been asked the\nquestions Judge Nathan posed to prospective jurors\nwho answered affirmatively to questions 25, 48, or 49,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021715.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page68 of 93\n55\n\nand therefore was not asked any questions about sex-\nual abuse. At the hearing, Judge Nathan examined Ju-\nror 5o in detail, and Juror 5o emphasized that his ex-\nperiences did not affect his ability to be fair and impar-\ntial, his ability to fairly assess the credibility of victim-\nwitnesses, or his ability to impartially judge Maxwell’s\nguilt. (A.268, 27o, 276-77).\n\n4. The District Court’s Decision\n\nJudge Nathan denied Maxwell’s motion for a new\ntrial in a detailed writen opinion. (A.3l8). First,\nJudge Nathan concluded that Juror 5o’s answers were\nnot deliberately inaccurate, crediting Juror 5o’s testi-\nmony in light of his demeanor and consistent, logical\nanswers to her questions. (A.333-35). Second, Judge\nNathan concluded that she would not have granted a\nfor-cause challenge to Juror 5o had he provided accu-\nrate information. At the hearing, Judge Nathan asked\nJuror 5o the questions she asked other jurors who in-\ndicated a personal experience with sexual assault or\nabuse. She concluded that “Juror 5o’s credible re-\nsponses [to those questions] under oath at the hearing\nestablished that he would not have been struck for\ncause if he had provided accurate responses to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.” (A.34o). As Judge Nathan explained,\nother jurors who answered the questions similarly\nwere not even challenged for cause, and she would not\nhave granted a challenge had one been made. (A.344-\n45). She also rejected the notion that mere similarities\nbetween Juror 5o’s life experiences and the issues at\ntrial required her to excuse Juror 5o for cause. (A.346).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021719.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page72 of 93\n59\n\nC. Discussion\n\nJudge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and\ndetermined that Juror 5o’s inadvertent errors on the\njury <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> did not undermine Maxwell’s right\nto a fair trial. Maxwell does not meaningfully engage\nwith Judge Nathan’s careful opinion, instead suggest-\ning that Juror 5o’s testimony at the hearing was “pa-\ntently absurd.” (Br.63). These conclusory arguments\nfall far short of establishing that Judge Nathan abused\nher discretion in finding that this case does not present\nthe extraordinary circumstances that justify overturn-\ning ajury’s verdict based on an error during voir dire.\n\nMaxwell’s claim fails at the first step of\nMcDonough because Juror 5o’s errors were inadvert-\nent. Juror 5o testified as much at the hearing, provid-\ning a detailed narrative of why his errors were a fail-\nure of diligence as he rushed through the question-\nnaire while distracted. (A.333-34). Judge Nathan cred-\nited this explanation in light of his demeanor, which\nshe “closely observe[d]” as he testified, including dur-\ning his answers to questions “he appeared not to ex-\npect.” (A.333). She explained that his answers were\n“logical explanations and generally internally con-\nsistent,” given in a “calm and straightforward man-\nner.” (/d.). Juror 5o’s explanations were consistent\nwith “his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir\ndire” and his testimony that “his sexual abuse history\nwas not salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”\n(Id.). Judge Nathan also noted that Juror 5o’s answers\naligned with his incentives: by testifying under a grant\nof immunity, he could not be prosecuted for his false\nanswers on the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, but he could be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l7l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021721.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page74 of 93\n6l\n2o2l) (holding that district court “properly recognized\nthat the initial question to be explored is whether the\njuror’s nondisclosure was deliberate or inadvertent”),\nvacated on other grounds, l42 S.

The hearing established that Juror 5o\nharbored no bias, approached his jury service with an\nopen mind, and was commited to deciding the case\nbased on the evidence and the District Court’s legal in-\nstructions. As Judge Nathan found, “Juror 5o’s credi-\nble responses [to questions asked of all jurors who in-\ndicated prior personal experience with sexual abuse]\nunder oath at the hearing established that he would\nnot have been struck for cause if he had provided ac-\ncurate responses to the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>.” (A.34o). If Ju-\nror 5o had accurately answered the questions relating\nto sexual abuse in the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span>, Judge Nathan\nwould have asked Juror 5o follou-up questions during\nvoir dire to determine if it would have granted a chal-\nlenge for cause. Judge Nathan asked those questions\nat the hearing, and Juror 5o’s sworn responses made\nclear that he was a fair and impartial juror who did\nnot harbor any bias and who would not have been ex-\ncused for cause.\n\nNor was Juror 5o the subject of any bias, actual,\nimplied, or inferred. After assessing Juror 5o’s de-\nmeanor, Judge Nathan found that he “repeatedly and\ncredibly affirmed that his personal history of sexual\nabuse would not affect his ability to serve as a fair and\nimpartial juror ‘in any way’” (A.34l-42), belying any\nsuggestion that he was actually biased against\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l72l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021722.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 79, o6/29/2o23, 3536o6o, Page75 of 93\n62\n\nMaxwell. Judge Nathan also correctly rejected Max-\nwell’s “central argument” that she should imply or in-\nfer bias “based on the purported similarities between\n[Juror 5o’s] personal history and the issues at trial.”\n(A.342-43). Judge Nathan explained that she “need not\nimagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that\nconclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every\nfollou-up question requested by the Defendant with\nregard to a juror’s personal experience with sexual as-\nsault, abuse, or harassment; although, for a majority\nof these eight jurors, the Defendant did not propose\nany follou-up questions.” (A.344-45). One prospective\njuror described her oun childhood sexual abuse at an\nage closer to the victims in this case; another described\na friend’s recent coercive sexual abuse by a professor.\n(A.345). Maxwell did not even bring a for-cause chal-\nlenge as to either. Ud.). Similarly, a for-cause chal-\nlenge against Juror 5o would not have prevailed.\n\nOn appeal, Maxwell contends that, had Juror 5o\nanswered the <span class=\"highlight\">questionnaire</span> accurately, it “clearly”\nwould have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.”\n(Br.67). In particular, Maxwell challenges Judge Na-\nthan’s finding that Juror 5o was credible and unbi-\nased, relying on a few isolated statements drawn from\nvarious parts of the hearing transcript and some of his\npost-verdict statements. (Br.7l-72). As described\nabove, Judge Nathan explained hou Juror 5o’s expla-\nnation for his erroneous answers was plausible and\nconsistent, and she found him credible after assessing\nhis demeanor through challenging questioning.

Epstein denied recent or present morbid thoughts\nand denied passive or active suicidal ideation. It was noted in BOP records that Epstein’s verbalizations\nwere future-oriented and did not have indications of helpless or hopeless thinking.\nAccording to Forensic Psychologist l, Epstein did not meet the criteria for any psychological diagnosis and\nwas designated as Mental Health Care Code l. This is indicative of an inmate who does not shou any\nsignificant level of functional impairment associated with a mental illness and does not demonstrate a need\nfor regular mental health intervention. Epstein was educated on emergency procedures for contacting the\nPsychology Department staff, and Epstein agreed to contact staff if he needed Psychology Department\nservices in the future.\nThe MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that based on the Psychological Services Intake\n<span class=\"highlight\">Questionnaire</span>, inmates have four different Care Code ratings.*” Code l means there are no concerns about\nthe inmate's mental health status; they have no needs and will not be folloued up with unless requested by\nstaff or the inmates. Code 2 means there is some history of mental health issues, but the inmate has them\nunder control and the Psychology Department will follou up monthly. Code 3 is more severe, requiring\nweekly visits by the Psychology Department to ensure the inmate is stable and if unstable would be moved\nto observation. Code 4 inmates are seen daily by the Psychology Department and are under constant\npsychological observation. The Chief Psychologist stated that a Code l inmate can be on suicide watch.\nSuicide watch is for inmates who are shouing immediate and exigent signs of being suicidal.\nSubsequent to the intake screening, on July 8, 2ol9, the Chief Psychologist consulted with the National\nSuicide Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, regarding the various risk factors associated\nwith Epstein for suicidality. These risk factors were that Epstein was involved in a high-profile case with\nmedia atention, had been charged with sex offenses, was on pretrial status, and there was the potential for\nbad news from a court proceeding that day. A determination was made that upon Epstein’s return from\ncourt, staff were to notify the psychologist and place Epstein on a “watch status” until a thorough suicide risk\nassessment could be conducted.\nWhen Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, it was after duty hours and MCC New York staff contacted\nthe Psychology Department and informed them that Epstein denied suicidality. Houever, for precautionary\nreasons, Epstein was placed on psychological observation status until Psychology Department staff could\nconduct a suicide risk assessment the follouing day.
