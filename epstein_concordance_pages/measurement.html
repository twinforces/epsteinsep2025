These bebaviors, com-\n\nmonly knoun as “grooming,” are understood as methods child\n\nmolesters use to gain access to and prepare future victims to be com-\n\npliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished\nfrom normal adult-child interactions.

Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span> strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5873", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005875.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 8 of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span> process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5875", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005883.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span> processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006293.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll9\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

It is important to devise an\naccurate definition of grooming for scientific, clinical, and forensic\npurposes. We critically evaluate the various definitions and reveal\nproblematic beterogeneity. Furthermore, there are no methods of\nknoun psychometrics to validly assess grooming. We review tbe\nempirical literature regarding the occurrence of grooming and\npropose future directions for research.\n\nKEYWORDS grooming, child sexual abuse, <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span>\nUnderstanding the process of child sexual abuse (CSA) is important for both\nits prevention and treatment. Some clinicians and researchers (e.g., Budin &\nJohnson, l989; Burgess & Holmstrom, l98o; Conte, Wolf, & Smith, l989,\nElliot, Broune, & Kilcoyne, l995) agree that a type of seduction stage,\ncommonly called “grooming” but also variously knoun as “entrapment,”\n“engagement,” or “subjection” often precedes the actual sexual abuse.\nOffenders have admited that they use techniques such as identifying a par-\nticularly vulnerable child, gift giving, and sexual desensitization to prepare\nthe child for the abuse (Seto, 2oo8).\n\nUnderstanding grooming has both important clinical and legal implica-\ntions. First, it is possible that if professionals were able to identify grooming\n\nReceived 23 May 2ol3; revised 28 January 2ol4; accepted lo April 2ol4.\nAddress correspondence to William O’Donohue, Department of Psychology, University\nof Nevada, Reno, Mail Stop 298, Reno, NV 89557.

Intrafamilial\ndefinitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as\ngrooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-\nilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse\n(Brackenridge, 2ool; Craven, Broun, & Gilchrist, 2oo6; Gallagher, l999),\ngaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nSalter, l995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the\nabuse (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Gallagher, l999; Gillespie, 2oo2;\nKnoll, 2olo; Leberg, l997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to\ngroom the child (Berson, 2oo3; Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982).\n\nFurthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-\nposed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, l995) while\nanother references “courtship” (Houit, l995). Some proposed definitions\ngive concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, l999; Sgroi, l982), while\nothers try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be\nthe essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2oo3; Spiegel, 2oo3). Some\ndefinitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2ool; Houit, l995;\nSpiegel, 2oo3), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about\nwhat grooming looks like (Berson, 2oo3; Craven et al., 2oo6; Sgroi, l982).\nObviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and\nclinical work.\n\nSome of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms\nused to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems\nthemselves. For example, Salter (l995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-\ntion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what\nexactly emotional seduction entails as well as a <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span> strategy to\nvalidly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2oo3)\ndefinition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-\nfusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and\nthus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of\nthe grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6798", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8of 43\n\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963\nwhich makes the definitional and <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span> process even more complex\nas each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this\nmust be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s\n(l987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved l3 separate steps,\nthe first lo of which according to the author can be identified as groom-\ning behaviors. As Houit (l995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle\nmakes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which\ncertainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.\n\nGROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS\nPart of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-\ning is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar\nto behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-\ndren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors\nto sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2oo9)\nwrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such\n‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that\nare, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male\nsports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to\nnormative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected\nand thus wants to disguise what he is seting out to accomplish. In addition,\nit must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.\nGroth, Hobson, and Gary (l982) differentiated between “child molesters”\nand “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their\nobservation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,\nwhereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors\nalso pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child\nrapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors\nas mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting\nadults. For example, Herman (l98l) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make\nan atempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flouers or presents (e.g.,\nexpensive jewelry or lingerie).\nTHE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING\nBecause the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there\nis no way to knou precisely hou prevalent grooming is because each study\nemploys some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several\nempirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific\nmethods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and\nkeep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l6 of 43\nGrooming in Child Sexual Abuse 97l\n4, Having age-appropriate and relationship-appropriate discussions of body\nparts.\n\n5. A care-giving figure saying “I love you” without the goal of manipulation\n(not using the phrase to get the child to do something inappropriate).\nTHE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING\nBecause grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-\ners (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),\nit should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are\nindicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-\nlished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly\nassess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly\nreduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition\nis seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid <span class=\"highlight\">measurement</span> processes.\nIt is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection\nof grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse\noccurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming\nprocess. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate\nat the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop\nfuture abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition\nand a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the\n\nnumber of false positives and false negatives.\n\nWe are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-\nician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors\ncan be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in\nour proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining\nthat the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling\nis excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;\nand (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior\nis to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.\n\nWhat is “inappropriate” admitedly is somewhat of a vague term that\nrequires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior\nfrom normal adult-child relationships. Houever, this judgment requirement\ncurrently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,\nthe diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician\njudges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these\njudgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear\nargument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must\nbe explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a\nnonproblematic judgment of the behavior.\n\nTo illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would\ngenerally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page9ofl58 9\nLBAAMAXlps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A.
