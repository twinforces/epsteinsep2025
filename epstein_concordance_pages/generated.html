As noted in\nMr. Epstein’s bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial\ndisclosure. Counsel’s advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the information provided to the Court. Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his\nforthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal.

Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter.

Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent.

For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison.

The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nae The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative) and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004467.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l7o of 349\nnarrative of Epstein’s philanthropic activities, rather than presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s\nassociation to the former President warranted leniency and, in any case, the USAO rejected the\ndefense argument that the mater should be left entirely to the state’s discretion.?!” The defense\nsubmission to the Deputy Atorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s connection\nto former President Clinton, but that submission was made well after the NPA was negotiated and\nsigned, and in it, counsel contended that the USAO had treated Epstein too harshly because of his\nassociation with the former President.?!3\n\nde The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at . . . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.?'* OPR also\node In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all frve subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004522.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 225 of 349\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this mater, please contact the office listed above.

The Government has conferred with legal counsel at the MDC, and this leter is\nbased on information provided to the Government during that conferral.\n\nAs the Court is aware, over the past several months, the defendant has been provided with\nfive hours of video-teleconference (“WTC”) calls with her atorneys every weekday. MDC legal\ncounsel has assured the Government that no MDC staff members have interfered with, recorded,\nor otherwise listened to the defendant’s VTC meetings with counsel.\n\nPreviously, the defendant’s VTC sessions with counsel were conducted over a WebEx\nconnection <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> by defense counsel. Recently, houever, the MDC determined that the use\nof a VTC connection <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> outside of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) system posed a security\nthreat and could more easily be accessed by third parties than a VTC connection <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> by the\nBOP itself.

As a result of the inadvertent double-booking of the virtual\nroom, the participants in both VTC meetings were logged into the room at the same time.\n\nIn order to ensure that such an issue does not occur again, MDC and BOP staff spent several\ndays working to set up a unique VTC virtual room for the defendant’s exclusive use on the BOP’s\nsystem. That process was completed last week, and the defendant’s VTC meetings with counsel\nresumed on or about August 2o, 2o2l using a unique VTC virtual room.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead.

The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses.

'*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006374.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel4of54\nstigma.

(See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is Irrelevant to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

For instance, although Flatley is not expected to testify about why he\nused a particular forensic program to confirm the accuracy of metadata, he is expected to testify\nthat he used the program. Similarly, he would testify more generally hou metadata is created and\ncan be modified. To the extent the Court has any concern that this (or any portion of Flatley’s\nproffered testimony) may cross the line into expert opinion, the Government stands ready to\nqualify Flatley as an expert.! And for that reason, the Government has ensured that the defendant\nhas long had notice that Flatley will testify about metadata and has long had Flatley’s expert\nqualifications. The Government’s September l5 leter described those qualifications, told the\ndefendant that Flatley would testify about user information associated with devices and documents\nand photographs associated with the devices, and pointed the defendant to a case in which Flatley\ndiscussed metadata. See Trial Tr. at 935-38, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr. 643 (PKC) (describing\nl The defense does not appear to dispute that Flatley could be qualified as an expert witness in this\nsubject; their objection is only one of notice.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll84\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 oflo\nexpert opinion testimony, either, and thus no notice objection can be sustained. But in any event\nthe Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,\nit is responsive to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso\nsuggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login\ndata, which shous that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”\nundermines that claim. The defendant can hardly claim that the Government provided insufficient\nnotice of testimony it discussed with the witness in response to the defendant’s expert notice and\nwhich the Government would only elicit in response to cross-examination on the subject.\n\nThere is no further opinion contained in the December 5 notes. In response to a question\nfrom defense counsel, the Government asked Flatley hou he determined the number of user\naccounts and logins, and Flatley rechecked those numbers. That information is additional detail\nfor the December 2 notes, and not itself expert opinion, new or otherwise. (And the production of\n35oo material the same day it was <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> is hardly an “untimely disclosure.”)\n\ne Although the Government has noticed the testimony, the Government is not planning\nto elicit any expert testimony about “clones.” (Def. Leter at 4). He will simply provide fact\ntestimony that he personally created an image of the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55.\n\ne Testimony that “once a file is burned onto a CD, can’t unburn it” and “on original CD,\ncreated date would be the same date as the modified date,” (Def. Leter at 5), is pure fact testimony.\nIt requires no specialized training to knou that information; Flatley can testify to those facts based\non his personal knouledge. And, again, this is testimony that the Government does not intend to\nelicit on direct examination, but rather would elicit only in response to cross-examination along\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol-l Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of4\nPage 2\n\nThe Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that Government\nExhibits 4o5 and 4l9 reflect registry software information for Government Exhibits 55 and 54,\nrespectively.

Examiner Flatley will explain that he confirmed the\naccuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner\nFlatley will explain that metadata is information about a file, such as the file name and when the\nfile was created. He will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or\nembedded inside certain files, like Word documents.\n\nThe Government also notes that Examiner Flatley discussed similar topics in testimony\nreferenced in the September l5, 2o2l leter. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, l5 Cr.\n643 (PKC) (describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. Dilomasso, l4 Cr. l6o\n(SAS) (describing hash values). He has also testified about similar topics in United States v.\nHealey, ll Cr. l32 (SAS).\n\nAs noted, the Government does not believe that the foregoing testimony encompasses the\nsort of “opinion” that requires expert testimony. Rather, Examiner Flatley’s testimony is based on\nhis first-hand knouledge and observation during his examination of the devices in question. To\nthe extent he offers anything resembling an opinion, it is the product of reasoning processes\nfamiliar to the average person. While Examiner Flatley possesses specialized knouledge by virtue\nof his training and experience, his testimony reflects his investigatory findings and conclusions,\nand is not rooted exclusively in his expertise. To the extent Examiner Flatley’s testimony is\ncharacterized as expert “opinion” testimony under Rule 7o2, we note that his experience and\ntraining are described in his curriculum vitae, which was produced to you on September l5, 2o2l\nbearing Bates number 35o3-ool.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll92\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011312.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

The Subjects Asserted That They Were Motivated by Reasonable\n\nStrategic and Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences\n\nIn addition to reviewing the documentary evidence, OPR questioned the five subject\natorneys, all of whom denied being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth or status in making\ndecisions regarding the investigation, in the decision to resolve the case through an NPA, or in\nnegotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal\ninvestigation that Epstein might try to employ against the USAO the same pressure that she\nunderstood had been used with the State Atorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to\ncounter Epstein’s possible influence by meeting with Acosta and Sloman to sensitize them to\nEpstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that the USAO had handled cases involving\nwealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[W]e\ntried to treat [the case] fairly, not looking at .. . hou wealthy is he, but also not saying we need to\ndo this because he is so wealthy.” Menchel expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not\nbelieve “it’s appropriate to go after somebody because of their status one way or the other.” Lourie\ntold OPR that Epstein’s status may have <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> more “front office” involvement in the case,\nbut it did not affect the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion that\nthe USAO’s handling of the case had been affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential connections.\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,\nwho told OPR that no one ever communicated to them that they should treat Epstein differently\nbecause of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he did not recall anyone at the USAO\nexpressing either qualms or enthusiasm about proceeding against Epstein because of his wealth\nand influence.\n\nOPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative\nevidence that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such\nmotivations. Of more significance, and as discussed more fully belou, was the fact that\ncontemporaneous records support the subjects’ assertions that the decision to pursue a pre-charge\nresolution was based on various case-specific legal and factual considerations.7‘4 OPR also\n2l2 In the pre-NPA leter to the USAO, counsel recited a litany of Epstein’s purported good deeds and charitable\nworks, including a trip Epstein took to Africa with former President Clinton to raise awareness of AIDS, and counsel\nalso noted that the former President had been quoted by New York Magazine describing Epstein as “a commited\nphilanthropist.”\n\n2l3 In the leter to the Deputy Atorney General, counsel suggested that the prosecution may have been\n“politically motivated” due to Epstein’s “close personal association with former President Bill Clinton.”\n2l4 OPR also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the factors\nthat influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA. Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and\nVillafafia all had long careers with the Department, and OPR considers it unlikely that they would all have joined with\nl43\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 354 3536o38, Page226 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 224 of 348\nIf you have additional questions which invalve this matier, please contact the office listed above.

August 2oo6: The USAO’s Leters to Victims\n\nDuring the time that the FBI Victim Specialist was preparing and sending FBI victim\nnotification leters, Villafafia was also preparing her oun introductory leter in anticipation of\nmeeting with each victim receiving the leter. Villafafia told OPR that she was “generally aware\nthat the FBI sends leters” but believed the FBI’s “process didn’t... have anything to do with my\nprocess.” Villafafia told OPR the “FBI had their oun victim notification system and their oun\nguidelines for when information had to be provided and what information had to be provided.”\nMoreover, Villafafia “didn’t knou when [FBI] leters went out” or “what they said.”?7°\nNevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that she did not intend for the leters she drafted to interfere with\nthe FBI’s notification responsibilities.\n\nIn August 2oo6, Villafafia drafted her leters to victims who had been initially identified\nby the FBI based on the PBPD investigative file. Villafafia told OPR that she “made the decision\nto make contact with victims early,” and she composed the introductory leter and determined to\nwhom they would be sent. Although these leters contained CVRA rights information, Villafafia\nmainly intended to use them as a vehicle to “introduce” herself and let the victims knou the federal\ninvestigation “would be a different process” from the State Atorney’s Office investigation in\nwhich “the victims felt they had not been particularly well-treated.” Villafafia told OPR that in a\ncase in which she “needed to be talking to young girls frequently and asking them really intimate\n275 OPR found no uniformity in the time lapse between the FBI’s interview of a victim and the issuance of an\nFBI leter to that particular victim, as the span of time between the two events varied from a few days to months.\nFurthermore, not every victim interviewed by the FBI received an FBI leter subsequent to her interview, and some\nFBI leters were sent to victims who had not been interviewed by the case agents. Finally, OPR’s review of FBI VNS\ndata revealed some leters that appeared to have been <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> in the VNS and not included in the FBI case file. OPR\ncould not confirm whether such leters were mailed or delivered.\n\n276 Villafafia, who did not have supervisory authority over the FBI’s Victim Specialist, told OPR that she did\nnot review the FBI notification leters and did not see them until she gathered them for production in the CVRA\nlitigation, which was initiated after Epstein pled guilty on June 3o, 2oo8.\nl98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l398\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021466.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 59o 3536o39, Page36 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29o of 348\ncontinuing.” The co-case agent also told OPR that, as of the time of his OPR interview in 2ol9,\nthe “the case was open .. . it’s never been shut doun.”\n\nOPR found no evidence that the FBI’s victim leters were drafted with the intent to mislead\nthe victims about the status of the federal investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language\n<span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> by the VNS was generic template language in use nationwide at the time and identical\nto that contained in standard form notification leters the FBI <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> and distributed from\nAugust 2oo6 through the 2oo7 signing of the NPA.*’* Nevertheless, the FBI’s leters omited\nimportant information about the status of the case because they failed to notify the victims that a\nfederal prosecution would go forward only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations under an\nagreement he had reached with the USAO. Victims receiving the FBI’s leter would logically\nconclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support a federal\nprosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that her “understanding of\nthis leter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving\nforward on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the\nfact that the USAO had agreed to end its federal investigation in September 2oo7 eventually came\nto light, the statement in the subsequent leters contributed to victims’ and the public’s conclusions\nthat the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.\n\nIn sum, OPR concludes that the statement in the FBI victim leters that the mater was\n“currently under investigation” was not false because the USAO and the FBI did continue to\ninvestigate and prepare for a prosecution of Epstein. The leters, houever, risked misleading the\nvictims, and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the leters did not provide\nimportant information that would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.\nNonetheless, OPR found no evidence that Villafafia or her supervisors participated in drafting\nthose leters or were aware of the content of the FBI’s leters until the Department gathered them\nfor production in the CVRA litigation. The use of FBI form leters that gave incomplete\ninformation about the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination between the\nfederal agencies responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of\natention to and oversight regarding communication with victims. Despite the fact that the case\nwas no longer on the typical path for resolving federal investigations, form leters continued to be\nsent without any review by prosecutors or the case agents to determine whether the information\nprovided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!°\nad The Department of Justice Inspector General’s Audit Report of the Department’s Victim Notification System\nindicates that leters the FBI system <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> in 2oo6 contained stock language for the notification events of “Initial\n(Investigative Agency)” and “Under Investigation” and leters <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> in 2oo8 contained stock language for the\nnotification events of “Advice of Victims Rights (Investigative)” and “Under Investigation.”\nals After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI sent a similar form leter requesting “assistance and\ncooperation while we are investigating the case” to the two victims living outside the United States.\n\n264\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l466\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022009.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 26 Filed o2/lo/2o Page6ofl5 6\nkllu2NoeC kjc\n\nl high likelihood that I'm going to file a motion to dismiss the\n2 indictment based on selective prosecution.

It is my\n\nl7 position that we are entitled to that information. It is an\n\nl8 investigation of the same incident. It is an investigation of\nl9 the circumstances with which my client is being charged. With\n2o that being said, I do think that we are entitled to whatever\n2l information was <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> in those reports, so I believe that\n22 also is going to cause a delay in the trial wherever we go with\n23 that issue.\n24 THE COURT: We already addressed that the last time.\n25 (Pause)\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22oo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022025.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page 2 of 38\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nA.

Michael Thomas would like this court to authorize the disclosure of any and all |\nreports <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> by investigators within the Bureau of Prisons regarding the August lo, 2ol9\nincident, if those have not been disclosed. Additionally, the defendant seeks any all documents,\nreports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have\nengaged in the same or similar conduct. Mr. Thomas requests the results of any disciplinary\nproceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding the discipline or administrative ~\nadjudication of any other employees who have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts. More\nspecifically, the defense is aware that there was an almost identical incident in 2oo5 or 2oo6\nwherein officers failed to conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate commited\n\n. suicide. The defense believes that only one of four officers in that case was given only a minor\n(l4) day suspension. Moreover, although the government will argue that this incident is far\nremoved from the current incident, the defendant disagrees. Mr. Thomas knew some of the\nindividuals in that incident and he was well aware that their conduct did not lead to their\nindictment or incarceration. In fact, many of those officers did not receive as much as a\nreprimand for falsifying the same documents that Mr. Thomas is nou charged with a federal\ncrime for submiting. This goes to Mr. Thomas’ defense in this case. The defendant’s state of\nmind is always a material and relevant fact in any criminal case. Indeed, the mens rea for U.S.\nCode § lool is that the party knouingly and willfully made the false statement. Undoubtedly,\ngiven the assertions already made this information is of significant importance to Mr. Thomas’\ndefense.\n\n| | 6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022038.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l5 of 38\ngovernment agencies because it is highly relevant to Mr. Thornas’ defense in this case.\nFurthermore, the government had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the\nInspector General’s office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government tumed over the results of\nthis search in the normal course of discovery production. This fact shous that the Inspector\nGeneral was investigating this incident thus all information they receive is discoverable.

Bryan sought\ndiscovery, under Rule l6(a)(l)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges\nagainst Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further\nobjection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the\nmater was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government’s objection.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022073.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page ll of 34\ndated April l, 2o2o, explaining that any responsive information in the Government’s possession\nand subject to disclosure had already been produced. The leter further explained that to the extent\nthe requests called for items not in the Government’s possession or not subject to disclosure,\nThomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was\nnot aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested\ninformation.\nOn April 9, 2o2o, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court\ncompelling the Government to produce the follouing:\ne The Inspector General’s report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein\nand BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the “Inspector\nGeneral’s Report”), as well as all supporting memoranda and other\ndocuments, (Mot. 4-5);\ne Any and all “reports <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> by investigators within the [BOP] regarding\nthe August lo, 2ol9 incident” as well as “documents, reports, witness\nstatements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who\nhave engaged in the same or similar conduct,” including “results of any\ndisciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding\nthe discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who\nhave failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts,” (Mot. 4, 6);\ne Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents\ncreated by “any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances\nsurrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein,” (Mot. 4, 7).\nFor the reasons that follou, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion\nshould be denied.\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o73\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022090.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 28 of 34\nbeen completed, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public.\nIt is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those\nrecommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being\nfinalized and publicly announced. Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in\nreaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these\ndiscussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure\nof any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine\nthe DOJ-OIG’s ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to\ninmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on\nthe issues. Accordingly, Thomas’s motion should be denied for the reason that the materials\nsought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9.\n\nSecond, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector\nGeneral’s Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials\nupon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure. To the extent that the forthcoming\nInspector General’s Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and\nprosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and lo,\n2ol9, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed\nto the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may “possibl[y]”\nhave <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> additional witness statements and “other information” that has not been produced\nby the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides\nmere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based atorneys who are\npreparing the Inspector General’s Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution’s\nunderstanding that those atorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022103.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page /7of9\ndisclose.” Gov’t Opp. at 2l-22. The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to\nproduce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.’\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel disclosure of materials related to the Inspector\nGeneral’s investigation is DENIED.\n\nIll. |BOP Materials\n\nThomas also seeks disclosure of “reports <span class=\"highlight\">generated</span> by investigators within the [BOP]\nregarding” Epstein’s death, and “any and all documents, reports, witness statements and\ndisciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct” similar to\nthat alleged against Thomas. Motion at 6. Houever, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the\nGovernment reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shoun that\nBOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in\npresenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents\nwith the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,”\n“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the\ninvestigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omited). There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP\npersonnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment. Thus, the\nCourt concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule l6 and\nBrady.\n\nTo be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing\nalone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution. “The court cannot find that\n' Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address\nwhether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it ls protected\nby the deliberative process privilege.
