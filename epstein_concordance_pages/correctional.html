Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000336.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 8 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 8\n4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, the defendant’s endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio\nfrequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed.\nAt best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide\nto cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773, 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because home detention\nwith electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start”); see also United\nStates v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United\nStates v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C. 2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2\nCr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\n5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here\n\nThe defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from\ncourt under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected.\n\nAt the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of\na government-run detention facility in the defendant’s home, is a condition of “release” that\nimplicates the Bail Reform Act. “[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant,\nif she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her oun home at her oun cost, has a right to do\nso under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution.” United States v. Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never\ndirectly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.l8 (2d Cir. 2oo7)\n(“The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would\nbe ‘contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail’ to allou wealthy defendants ‘to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (citations omited)). Indeed, a decision by this Court\nreasoned that “the very severe restrictions” in the private jail proposal presented to him did “not\nappear to contemplate ‘release’ so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or\ndetention.” United States v. Zarrab, 2ol6 WL 368l423, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6).\n\nCourts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant’s which, “at\nbest ‘elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility\ninstills.’” United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. l993) (quoting United States v. Goti,\n776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. l99l) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F.\nSupp. 3d at 295 (“The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use\nforce against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether\nthe guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the\nimperfections—of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more\nsecure option of an actual jail.”). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled\nenvironment of a federal <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner\ncan be atended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant’s proposed\nprivate jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-\nflight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape atempt while in the community and involving\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000337.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 9 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 9\narmed private guards atempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—trather than the\ndefendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the\ndefendant’s flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s}uch a conclusion would, in fact,\ndemand a defendant's detention’”)).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”\nas “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2ol4) (“There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would\nsuggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has\na statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location.”).\n\nThe defendant’s payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having\nthe defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding\nhim, leaving the company’s incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v. Tajideen, l7 Cr. o46, 2ol8\nWL l342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. l5, 2ol8) (finding Zarrab “particularly instructive” and further\nnoting: “While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's\nsecurity detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's\njurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the pouer of money and its potential to corrupt or\nundermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they\nalso cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored.”).\n\nFinally, in Zarrab this Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded armed guard\nproposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a\nvery small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 2ol6\nWL 368l423, at *l3; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 (“although this Defendant has vast\nfinancial resources to construct his oun ‘private prison,’ the Court is not convinced ‘disparate\ntreatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act’”) (quoting United States v.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo337\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000623.jpg": "ease l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 44 _ Filed o8/l4/l9 Page l of2\nyy .

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list.

There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooool46l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page lo of 26\nprior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-l9.

Our immediate goal is to rectify these\nproblems and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is\npresently confined within your facility.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan entered an order of detention\nremanding Ghislaine Maxwell to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained\nsince her arrest on July 2, 2o2o and has been incarcerated at MDC under conditions that rival\nthose at USP Florence ADMAX. An exemplary inmate who poses no threat to her personal\nsafety or danger to anyone, she has spent the entirety of her detention in de facto solitary\nconfinement, tantamount to imprisonment as a defendant convicted of capital murder and\nincarcerated on death rou. The conditions of her detention are uterly inappropriate, especially so\nfor a non-violent defendant with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a quarter-\ncentury old.\n\nWithout a doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint\non Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the\nMetropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center (MCC- Manhatan) which resulted in the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein. The Atorney General of the United States has said as much. The BOP has admited\nthat the sanctions are not in response to a specific threat that Ms. Maxwell has shoun; rather they\nare in response to the high-profile nature of the case and the acknouledged failure by the BOP to\nkeep Epstein — an actual threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of\nincompetence on MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:\n\n' Previous leters were sent to you on August 28, 2o2o and September 9, 2o2o.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool87o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001871.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 6 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\n\nAtorney General William Barr told ABC News on Wednesday that he is keeping a close\n\nwatch to make sure that Maxwell makes it to trial after Epstein died by suicide in a\n\nManhatan jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he was \"/ivid\" Epstein died while\n\nin custody last August. The investigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.\n\n\"I believe very strongly in that case,\" Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. \"And I was\n\nvery proud of the work done by the department, the Southern District [of New York], on\n\nthat case. And as you will recall, after he commited suicide, I said that I was confident\nthat we would continue to pursue this case vigorously and pursue anyone who's complicit\nin it. And so I'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.” A source said the\n\nBOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust and confidence as\n\nwell as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.”\n\nWhat is clear is that the Government is “livid” over the death of Epstein and is seeking to\nrepair its reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions; not in any\nresponse to Ms. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a\ncompletely different defendant.\n\nMs. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee who has never received a disciplinary\ndemerit. The purpose of this leter is not simply to express complaint due to the institutional\nviolations and denial of rights suffered by Ms. Maxwell in relation to her pretrial incarceration.\nRather, it seeks to bring an unwarranted situation to your atention - conditions that are unduly\ncruel and punitive and circumstances that are deleteriously impacting our client’s ability to\nprepare her defense which, in turn, interferes with our ability to provide the legal representation\nto which she, and any other detainee, deserves.\n\nWe continue our ongoing atempt to resolve these maters without court intervention. We\nhave voiced complaint through the MDC Legal Department, your office, the AUSAs in charge\nof this case, and the Federal Defenders of New York.* Ms. Maxwell has atempted to resolve\nthese maters by follouing the internal prison procedures, filing writen complaints to her unit\ncounselor (BP8), to the warden (BP9), and to the regional office (BP lo), to seek remediation as\nset forth in the BOP manuals and inmate handbook. All to no avail.\n\nDraconian Conditions of Pretrial Detention\n\nMs. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are extraordinarily onerous - and unlike those\nof any other inmate at the MDC (or in BOP custody, to our knouledge). In fact, in the time that\nMs. Maxwell has been at the MDC, she has met with five separate wardens and interim wardens,\nmany who have remarked that they have never seen in their collective years of experience\n* See, “Ghislaine Maxwell given paper clothes at <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> center to avoid suicide atempt: Sources\nJeffrey Epstein, her associate, died by suicide in jail last August.”’ btps://abcnews.go.com/US/ghislaine-\nmaxwell-paper-clothes-<span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span>-center-avoid-suicide/story?id=7l699ooo (emphasis added).\n> The Federal Defenders of New York has been tasked with scheduling of atorney-client communication\nin connection with ongoing litigation against the MDC based on conditions of confinement during\nCOVID pending in the Eastern District of New York before the Honorable Margo K.

STERNHEIAA\nanything like her current regime.* The follouing conditions and circumstances of her detention,\nindividually and collectively, compromise her opportunity to confer with counsel and prepare her\ndefense for trial and are detrimental to her physical health and psychological well-being:\n\nDe Facto Solitary Confinement: Ms. Maxwell is the sole inmate in a housing unit. By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”. In\naddition, counsel is Curcio counsel for a client authorized for the death penalty who is in general\npopulation at the MCC. Having visited BOP facilities during the past 35 years and representing clients\ncharged with the most heinous and violent crimes of murder, counsel had never had a client subjected to\nsuch punitive conditions of pretrial (or post-conviction) incarceration as in the present case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool872\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001873.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 8 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nespecially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up\nnegative.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,\nsubjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and\ndisparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24\", she was subjected to a\nwanded, full pat doun search yielding negative results. Within lo minutes, she was subjected to\na strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of\nemployment as a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these\nsearches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,\nshe is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously\nand unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.\n\nDeprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has\nrequested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the\nprison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only\nbread and buter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was\ngiven access to the menu for the first time on September l*, after she complained that she had\nbeen given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals\nwith all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.\n\nMoreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long\nstretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more\nthan 2o hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate\nnutrition, she has lost upwards of l5 to 2o pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,\nshe is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen\neffluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability\nto concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a\ntoothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.\n\nIn addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied\naccess to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although\nthe MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full\nprison commissary list in August 2o2o, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely\nlimited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any\nmisconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure\nto provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and\nconcentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.\n\nDeprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole\ninmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every l5 minutes by\nflashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight\nchecks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep\nnegatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense\npreparation.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool873\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002538.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38-4 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 6 of l4\nabuse of minors.

The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Atorney\ndecides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follou . .. a version of my writen non-\nprosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on a\nstrict timeline.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a\n2o-month jail sentence to be folloued by lo months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.”!\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB. September l2, 2oo7: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State\n\nAtorney\n\nAlthough the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal\ninvestigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State\nAtorney’s Office in those discussions until September l2, 2oo7. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.

SDNY’s focus was always on righting the wrongs resulting from\nthe Florida prosecution: Epstein was undercharged and under punished, Epstein never faced his\naccusers, and his accusers were denied justice. Epstein was the target and the focus of the\nprosecution until his death in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) in August 2ol9.\nEpstein’s 2ol9 Arrest and Aftermath\n\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in connection with an SDNY indictment. He\nwas detained in the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center (“MCC”) until his untimely death in custody\non August l9, 2ol9. The highly publicized announcement of his arrest and detention came as a\nrelief and vindication for women who had filed complaints against him. His capture and\nconfinement quelled public outrage at Epstein’s lenient Florida plea deal from October 2oo7 and\nthe lou sentence he received. Epstein’s death approximately one month after his arrest eliminated\nany prospect ofa trial, again shocking and disappointing his accusers. It also highlighted the failure\nof the U.S. government to ensure that an inmate in federal custody, in such a sensitive and high-\nprofile case, could be kept safe and alive to face trial.\n\nIn the face of strong media and public uproar follouing Epstein’s death, the government\nfaced an urgency to appease the renewed distress of Epstein’s accusers and to repair the tarnished\nreputations of the DOJ and BOP in whose custody Epstein died. There would be no trial for\nEpstein and no public vindication and justice for his accusers. The government nou had a huge\nhole to fill: Epstein’s empty chair.

No. 2879-5o9\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThis leter is writen in response to your order dated December 2, 2o2o, concerning Ghislaine\nMaxwell, Reg. o2879-5o9., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,\nNew York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can\nwork and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing\nassignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for\nher safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with\nMs. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to hou to address any concerns through\nher Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.lo — 542.l9. To date,\nstaff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.\n\nIn her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is alloued\naccess to the common area of the housing unit from 7:oo AM through 8:oo PM, daily. She has access to\nrecreational space, social calls, television, shouer, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery\nmaterial. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:oo AM through 5:oo PM. When Ms. Maxwell\nreturns to her cell at 8:oo PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased\nthrough the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell has been able to\npurchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other\ninmates.\n\nMDC Brooklyn <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020379.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 92, o5/27/2o2l, 3lo97o8, Page2l of 24\n\ninto Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as\ncorroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding\ndescribed in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center (the\n“MCC”), not the MDC. (See United States v.

There is no evidence in the record from the Days case\nor this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC\nduring Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any\nsuch issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should\nseek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about\nher ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge\nNathan.°\n\n+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at\n3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general\npopulation. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general\npopulation. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that\nshe is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has\naccess to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during\nwhich she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a\ntelephone, a television, anda shouer. (See Dkt. l96 at 2).\n\n> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC\nhave gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021180.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONG 3536o38, Pages of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 6 of 348\nabuse of minors. The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the\ngovernment’s actions.*\n\nOn February 2l, 2ol9, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the\nvictims about its intention to enter into the NPA.° The court also found that leters the government\nsent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, “mislead [sic]\nthe victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court also highlighted\nthe inequity of the USAO’s failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time\nengaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA\nwould not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court ordered the parties to submit\nadditional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s order, the Department\nrecused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the\nNorthern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought\nby the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal\nprosecution of Epstein.\n\nOn July 2, 2ol9, the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York obtained\na federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and\none count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from\n2oo2 until 2oo5, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida\nwhom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2ol9. In\narguing for Epstein’s pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein’s\nManhatan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least\none believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded\nto the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center in\nManhatan.\n\nMeanwhile, after publication of the November 2ol8 Miami Herald report, the media and\nCongress increasingly focused atention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the\nNPA. On July lo, 2ol9, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO’s\nactions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Atorney’s Office “was ready to allou Epstein to\nwalk free with no jail time, nothing.” According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered\nthis outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a\nresolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims\nwith the means to obtain monetary damages. Acosta’s press conference did not end the\ncontroversy, houever, and on July l2, 2ol9, Acosta submited to the President his resignation as\n4 See, e.g., Ashley Collman, “Stunning new report details Trump’s labor secretary’s role in plea deal for\nbillionaire sex abuser,” The Business Insider, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Cynthia McFadden, “New Focus on Trump Labor\nSecretary’s role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse,” NBC Nightly News, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Anita\nKumar, “Trump labor secretary out of running for atorney general after Miami Herald report,” McClatchy Washington\nBureau, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Emily Peck, “Hou Trump’s Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser,”\nHuffington Post, Nov. 29, 2ol8; Julie K.

This redrafted NPA\ncontained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least\nl7 months in a state <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended\nit to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with\nthe State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the\nrevised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the\nfollouing day, after she learned of it.\n\nOn September ll, 2oo7, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would\nbe prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the follouing day. At\nSloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for\nthe follouing week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia\ncirculated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterban, seeking their feedback before\nsending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterban the revised NPA and\ntold him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the\nUSAO’s offer. Oosterban responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s\nunderstandable.” !°°\n\nThat afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,\n“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 3o-month sentence, split 2o in jail and lo in\n‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in\ndeadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”\n\nB.

On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,\nand another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West\nPalm Beach office, and Epstein atorneys Lefkouitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State\nAtorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Atorney Lanna Belohlavek.

The MCC, which houses approximately 75o inmates at |\nany given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within\nthe McC. ‘The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates\nare securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure |\ntheir oun safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates.\n\nThe SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to\nthat fioor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened\nremotely only by an officer in the MCC’s centralized control center\n(the “Control Center”), which is located on the first floor of the\nMCC, Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked .\ndoor to which only <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers assigned to the SHU have\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l9lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021911.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 4 of 2o\nkeys while on duty. Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to Six |\nseparate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single |\nlocked door to which the <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers assigned to the SHU |\nhave keys while on duty. Each tier has eight celis, each of which\ncan house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell —- |\nwhich is made of cement and metal - is accessed only through a\nsingle locked door, to which only <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers assigned | |\nto the SHU have keys while on duty. |\n\n7. The BOP requires <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers assigned to :\nguard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of\ninmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate\nis alive and accounted for within the MCC (the “institutional\ncount”). On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts\nat 4 p.m., lo p.m., l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects\nof a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officer's job, and the count is one of the most\nbasic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two\nofficers are required to perform the institutional count for each\nhousing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to\ndocument their performance of the count on an official MCC form\ncalled a count slip. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count\neach individual inmate.\n\n4 .\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l9ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021912.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Documentl Filed ll/l9/l9 Page 5 of 2o |\na.

BACKGROUND\nA The Indictment Alleges that Mr. Thomas Conspired with Co-Defendant,\nNoel. and Created Faise Records\nThe government’s investigation in this case began upon the discovery of the alleged\nsuicide of Jeffrey Epstein, on August lo, 2ol9, at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center\n| (“MCC”).\nAt that time, Mr. Thomas, and Co-Defendant, Noel, were on duty as <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers\nin the section of the MCC, knoun as the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).\nThe indictment (Indictment, Introduction at l), alleges, among other things, that certain |\nprison counts, in other words, physically counting the prisoners in the cells, were not made by |\n. the defendants. In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants, then, agreed and conspired\nto conceal the failure to conduct the prison atm by creating and signing false records,\natesting that such counts had occurred. (7d.)\nThus, the indictment charges the defendants with conspiracy. (Indictment, Count One at {\n28.) In addition, the indictment charges the defendants with creating false records. (Indictment,\nCount Four at 7 l5.) Defendant, Thomas, is not charged in Counts Two and Three of the\nindictment.\nB. Mr. Thomas’ Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Requests for Production\nof Documents Have Been Denied\nOn December l6, 2ol9, the parties agreed to a protective order as to discovery, and on\nthat day this Court entered same (Docket # l3). On January 29, 2o2o, defendant, Thomas, made\ncertain requests to the government under Rule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n(See Exhibit A.) Approximately, forty-five days later, on March l4, 2o2o, the government\nresponded to the requests made by defendant, Thomas with a one sentence denial of said request.\nThe substance of the response was that the defendant should refer to the government’s responses\nmade at the pretrial conference of November 25, 2ol9.

As the bureau, which oversees\nl22 federal prisons and more than l7o,ooo inmates nationwide, is working to implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with the circumstances\nthat led to Epstein's death, it is facing severe resource issues, according to Hawk Sawyer.\n“\\We have put such huge strains on the Burean of Prisons trying to accomplish its mission,\" Hawk Sawyer said before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, “With\nthe dramatic grouth we've had, the budget cuts, staffing shortages, it’s just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able to function during the last l6\nyears that I've been gone.” The vast majority of staff are good, hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretched,\" she added.\nHawk Sawyer atributed the resouree problem to the rapid increase in the prison population in the last 3o years, employees retiring at a faster rate than they\n. are hired, uncertain budgets, ihe recent government shutdoun andthe hiring [freeze early in the Trump administration. \"We have never had adequate\n__ Pesources to provide all the programs for all the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change nou since you all support the First Step Act.”\nAccording to the hurean's website it currently has 96,348 staff members. The New York Times reported:\nBetween December 2ol6 and September 2ol8 — the date of the most recent data available from the federal Office of Personnel Management — the number of\n<span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers fell more than ll%, from l9,o82 to l6,898. That decline reversed a longtime trend. Before President Doneld Trump tock office, the\nnumber of federal <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers had continuously increased: there were l2.5% more officers at the end of 2ol6 compared to the beginning of 2ol2.\nHawk Sawyer said the bureau has “made great progress\" to fill the over 3,3oo vacancies nationwide, but it is going to take a while. In order to hire more staff,\nthe bureau is working with the Office of Personnel Management to get direct hiring authority, hiring retirees on a temporary basis because they are already\n- \" trained and using the professional services company Accenture to recruit young people online.\nSawyer said the only thing that impedes the bureau from providing adequate care and services for inmates is resources. She expects the agency will receive\n$75 million in this year’s appropriations for the First Step Act, which the law requires for the first five years, although she hoped for more.

Although Sawyer said this is a\ngood process and all staff are trained forthis role, she admited the agency hes to use augmentation more than is optimal and often employees are taken away\nfrom their designated work.\nIn addition to hiring, Hawk Sawyer said the bureau is working to replace the surveillance cameras in all prisons, ensure that staff are thoroughly trained and\nhave managers repeatedly tell staff what their responsibilities are. These are all issues that came to light in the wake of the Epstein scandal.\nAs the hearing was going on the.Justice Department indicted the two federal <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers on duty the night of Epstein’s death with ialsitying records\nto say they checked on him. ; .\nHawk Sawyer agreed with Sen, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that the Epstein situation was a “black eye” on the entire agency. Since the FBI and the Justice Department\ninspector General are looking into the Epstein case she said she could not speak about any specifics.\n“We have some bad staff,” Hawk Sawyer said. \"We want rid of those bed staff who don’t do theirjob. We want them gone one way or another either by\nprosecution or by termination. But the good staff are doing extraordinary work out there every day managing the l77,ooo inmates.

The Government’s Discovery Production\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2ol9, the Court set a discovery deadline\nof December 3l, 2ol9. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the\nGovernment made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the\nfollouing: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by\nNoel and Thomas from August 9 to lo, 2ol9; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC\nphone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness\ninterviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and the DOJ-OIG\nwho were participating in the investigation.”\n\nSubsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more\nlimited in scope. On January 23, 2o2o, the Government produced additional interview reports and\n\n? The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required\nunder Rule l6, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of\ncaution.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022072.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page lo of 34\nwriten statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the\nUnited States Inspector General.” Noel’s January 29 leter sought materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating\nparticular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously\nproduced in discovery.\n\nAt the pretrial conference the follouing day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request\nfor “whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with\nrespect to the Inspector General’s report.” (Conf.

As for Thomas’s request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General’s\nreport, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2ol9\npretrial conference. With respect to Noel’s requests for additional materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the\nGovernment’s possession and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced. In\naddition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel’s questions,\nincluding video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage.\n\nOn March 27, 2o2o, Thomas submited another discovery request to the Government,\nseeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers and\ninformation about the Government’s charging decisions.

ECF No. l. The indictment alleges that Thomas,\nin his capacity as a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officer at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center (the “MCC”),\nalong with another officer, co-Defendant Tova Noel, submited several false “count slips” on the\nnight of August 9, 2ol9 and the morning of August lo, 2ol9, certifying that he conducted counts\nof the inmates he was supervising in the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), even though he\ndid not conduct those counts. Jd. §§ l6, 3o, 36, 38, 4o. During that time period, one of the\ninmates in the SHU—Jeffrey Epstemm—hanged himself in his cell. Jd. §§ l, 26-27.\n\nThomas nou moves to compel the Government to produce evidence in connection with\nthe trial scheduled to begin on January 4, 2o2l. Motion, ECF No. 33.

Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his\nprosecution.\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the\nsubmission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery\nrelated to selective prosecution, is DENIED.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED.

Many of\nthose same operational challenges, including staffing\nshortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,\nfunctional security camera systems, and management\nfailures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review into the custody, care, and\nsupervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious\ninmates, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of\ninformation from the BOP that on August lo, 2ol9, in\nthe Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center in New York,\nNew York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged\nin his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU).

SHU inmates are securely separated\nfrom general population inmates and kept locked in\ntheir cells for approximately 23 hours a day.\n\nBOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at\nleast twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at\nleast one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also\nrequires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour\nperiod. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds\nenable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they\nare secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to\neliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU\nstaff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells\ndaily, and to search the entire SHU every week.\n\nOn July l8, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and\nordered him detained pending trial on the\ncriminal charges.\n\nIncident Involving Epstein on July 23\n\nWhile in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on\nnumerous occasions by psychological staff, including a\nformal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations\nhe denied having thoughts or a history of atempted\nsuicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not\nmeet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.\n\nOn July 23, at l:27 a.m., <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> officers (CO)\nresponded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found\nEpstein with an orange cloth around his neck.

According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is\n“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by\npreparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” Houever, the DO] Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing\noperational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions\nsafely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in\nthis report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing\nshortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional\nsecurity camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and\nprocedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into\nthe custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We\ntherefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address\nthese recurring issues.\nThe OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of\nAugust lo, 2ol9, in the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),\ninmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU\nis a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked\nin their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their oun safety as well as the safety of staff and\nother inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2ol9, the day after his arrest, due to the\nsignificant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.\nAccording to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,\nall SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate\ntiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver\nbreakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to\ndeliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was\nhoused alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein\nhanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top\nportion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position\nwith his butocks approximately l inch to l inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on\nthe floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple\nnooses that had been made from torn prison linens.\nSHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency\nand prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 9ll emergency services. SHU\nstaff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s butocks to drop to the\nground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding\nMCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated\nexternal defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR\non Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant.

On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York).

When it was operational, MCC New York housed approximately 75o inmates\nat any given time. Prior to its closure, the majority of MCC New York’s inmate residents were individuals\nwith pending criminal charges (as opposed to individuals who had been convicted of offenses and were\nserving a sentence of imprisonment), but whom the court had determined under applicable law should\nremain in custody pending trial either because they represent a danger to the community, a substantial\nflight risk, or both. MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates.

Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\n<span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate.

The indictment further alleged that Epstein, working with employees and associates,\ncreated a vast network of underage victims to sexually exploit in New York and Florida by paying some\nvictims hundreds of dollars in cash each to recruit other minor girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. In\naddition to the two criminal charges, the indictment also contained forfeiture allegations, which sought to\nforfeit to the United States any property that was either used to commit or was a proceed of the charged\nsex trafficking offense, including Epstein’s New York residence.\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the\nUnited States from France.

This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9.

The\nSupervisory <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Systems Specialist verified that Receiving and Discharge would have used the\nUSMS emails sent on August 8, 2ol9, to coordinate Inmate 3’s transfer out MCC New York, and since\nInmate 3 was listed as “WAB” on the USMS emails, that meant he was being transferred from the facility and\nnot coming back. She explained to the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial\ninmates held at MCC New York often did, the Daily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than “pre-\nremove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who\nentered the information into the report were made aware that Inmate 3 was being transferred from MCC\nNew York on or before the morning of August 9, 2ol9. The Supervisory <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Systems Specialist told\nthe OIG that the language in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e., “with all belongings”) and MCC New York reports\n(“pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be returning to the SHU or MCC New York.\nThe OIG also interviewed the <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Systems Officer, who was the Receiving and Discharge officer who\nhandled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York on August 9, 2ol9. The <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Systems\nOfficer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2ol9, at\n8:38 a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to another prison. She explained to\nthe OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving and Discharge personnel would enter the information\nregarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining to other inmates who would be leaving\ntheir MCC New York housing units. Receiving and Discharge used this information to create the daily call\nout list, which had all of the inmates’ names and times that they were to be moved. The <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span>\nSystems Officer told the OIG that the call out list from August 9, 2ol9, was no longer available because the\ncall out lists were printed and hand-delivered to the housing units each day, and then discarded by the units\nat the end of the day. She also said each day’s call out list was only maintained electronically for a 24-hour\nperiod, and then it was updated (overwriten) with the next day's list. In her OIG interview, the <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span>\nSystems Officer explained what would have occurred on this date based on her experience.

SHU Inmate Counts\nAs detailed in the BOP policies section of Chapter 2, the BOP requires COs assigned to guard inmates to\nconduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regularly scheduled intervals each day to ensure that all\ninmates are present and accounted for at the appropriate location within the facility. Performing an\ninstitutional count is one of the basic and essential aspects of a CO's job, and the count was one of the basic\nand essential components of the daily operation of MCC New York. The Captain told the OIG that counts are\na core responsibility of COs and ensure accountability of the inmates. The Evening Watch Operations\nLieutenant said that it is very important that the institutional count is accurate because that is hou staff\nmembers knou if all inmates are present and if anyone has escaped.\nOn weekdays, MCC New York conducted institutional counts at l2 a.m., 3 a.m., 5 a.m., 4 p.m., and lo p.m.\nThe lo p.m. count was a stand-up count, which meant that inmates were required to stand when they were\ncounted. Pursuant to BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders, two COs were required to perform\nthe institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU. To perform the institutional count in the\nSHU, BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders required two officers to walk from tier to tier to\nobserve and count each individual inmate. During each count, one CO would count the inmates while the\nother officer observed the inmates. The two officers would then switch roles and compare the count\nnumbers. If the totals did not match, then the officers had to conduct another count in the same manner.\nCOs had to document their performance of inmate counts on an official MCC New York form often referred\nto as a count slip.*\nOn the count slip, COs were required to fill in the date and time the count had been performed, write the\ntotal number of inmates physically present in the unit counted, and then both COs printed their name and\nsigned the count slip. Once the COs had completed and signed the count slip, the count slips were then\ncollected and delivered to the Control Center. Officers assigned to the Control Center were responsible for\ncomparing the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each\ninmate was accounted for. Only after all the count slips had been collected from each housing unit, and the\nnumbers on the slips had been matched to the institution’s inmate roster, could the institutional count be\ndeemed “cleared” or completed. If a housing unit’s count slip was incomplete or did not match the number\nof inmates that were supposed to be in the unit, then the count had to be redone in that housing unit via a\nmore intensive version of the institutional count, called a bed-book count, which is when inmates are\ncounted using their picture cards. Records of each institutional count, including the count slips, were\nprovided to a supervising official and retained by MCC New York.\nThe OIG's investigation found that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted from 4 p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, until Epstein was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo,\n2ol9. Further, the OIG determined that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, and that the count slips and round sheets had been falsified.

At some point, the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant heard that there was a medical emergency in SHU, so she went to assist because she\nknew that inmates would need to be given food and other things would need to be done.

Additionally, no\ninmate provided the OIG with information suggesting that anyone assisted Epstein with taking his oun life\nor had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\nSome MCC New York staff told the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other\nthings, Epstein had been assigned a new cellmate after Inmate 3’s departure and rounds and counts had\nbeen conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,\nwhich resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members were often overtired\nduring their shifts.

The FBI\ninspected the cell and retrieved what it believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player. The FBI did not recover\nany weapons inside of the cell. After the FBI's inspection, the BOP recycled the linens from Epstein’s cell and\ncollected the remaining items, which included various over-the-counter medications, books (including\nreligious books), BOP pamphlets, toiletries, bateries, headphones, glasses, mail and envelopes, a broun\npaper bag, an orange homemade rope, AED pads, and a medical device.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23443\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023448.jpg": "Chapter 6: The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nDue to the Security Camera Recording System Failure\nIn August 2ol9, the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had\napproximately l5o video security cameras (no audio) placed throughout the institution. The Office of the\nInspector General (OIG) found that approximately ll cameras were located in and around the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death on August lo, 2ol9, including one at\nthe end of the L Tier where Epstein was housed that shoued any movement in or out of inmate cells and in\nthe Tier’s hallway. In addition to broadcasting live video, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live\nvideo feeds. Follouing Epstein’s death, MCC New York officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\ninvestigators atempted to review video recordings related to the incident and discovered that, although the\nsecurity cameras were working and transmiting live video, recorded video from most of the cameras in the\nSHU area was not available due to a malfunction of the video recording system that had occurred on July 29,\n2ol9, including video from the camera at the end of the L Tier. As a result, while the L Tier video camera\nwas transmiting a live video feed on the night of August 9, 2ol9, and morning of August lo, 2ol9, the video\nwas not being recorded. One of the cameras that had available recordings from August 9 and lo was a\ncamera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That camera captured video of a large part of\nthe common area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to\nthe different SHU tiers, including the L Tier. Thus, anyone entering or atempting to enter the L Tier from\nthe common area of the SHU, including on August 9 and lo, would have been picked up by the video\nrecorded by that camera. In addition, the recordings shoued the SHU Officers’ Station where the two SHU\nstaff were seated at a desk immediately outside the entrance to the L Tier and diagonally across from\nEpstein’s cell, which was the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.\n|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York\nAll video surveillance from MCC New York’s cameras was connected to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR)\nsystem. The DVR system had two data storage systems that were labeled “DVR l” and “DVR 2,” and each\nconsisted of l6 hard drives used for storing digital recordings. Roughly half of MCC New York's security\ncameras were assigned to record to DVR l, and the other half were assigned to record to DVR 2. Cameras\nassigned to DVR l only recorded to the DVR l hard drives, and cameras assigned to DVR 2 only recorded to\nthe DVR 2 hard drives. Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video from the DVR 2-assigned cameras could be\nretrieved from DVR l, and vice versa.\nThe OIG's investigation revealed a history of camera problems at MCC New York. In August 2ol9, the\nElectronics Technician was the only such technician at MCC New York. The Electronics Technician told the\nOIG that when he began work at MCC New York in 2ol6, he found that the facility's security camera system\nneeded to be upgraded. According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly\nmaintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently malfunctioned and needed to be\nreplaced, and the overall system was outdated, in part because the cameras were analog and not digital.\n8l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23448\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023450.jpg": "recorded video was available for several of the institution's cameras, so she reported the mater to the\nCommunications Office, and the Electronics Technician arrived to assess the problem sometime before his\nshift was scheduled to end. The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l technical support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.\n\n5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to\nseveral days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.\n83\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023451.jpg": "the SIS Lieutenant assumed that the Electronics Technician would remain at the institution after his shift\nended that day to correct the issue. The Electronics Technician told the OIG there must have been some\nmiscommunication because he did not say he was going to work overtime and resolve the problem that\nsame evening since he knew the problem could not be fixed in one evening. The Electronics Technician told\nthe OIG that, in hindsight, he should have stayed at the institution to begin work on the problem that\nsame day.\nThe SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that she verbally informed the Captain on August 8 that the cameras were\ndoun, but BOP records reflect that the Captain left the institution before the malfunction was discovered.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he did not learn about the DVR recording issue until after Epstein’s death on\nAugust lo when he asked to see video related to the Epstein incident. Associate Warden l confirmed she\nwas with the SIS Lieutenant on August 8 when the camera problem was discovered, but she told the OIG she\nonly knew video could not be replayed. She did not knou the recording system for certain cameras was\ndoun. She could see live video from the cameras on that date, and therefore assumed they were recording.\nAccording to the Electronics Technician, after he reported to work on August 9, 2ol9, and atended to other\nmaters throughout the day, the Electronics Technician obtained the replacement hard drives and\natempted to perform the repair sometime late in the day. Houever, the Electronics Technician told the OIG\nthat no SIS staff were present at that time to give him access to the room in which the DVR room was\nlocated, so he requested access from the only other individual who had a key to the space, <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span>\nOfficer (CO) 4.° According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 denied him access to the room because CO\n4's shift was ending at 4 p.m., and CO 4 was unable to stay and accompany him in the space while the\nElectronics Technician performed the work. According to the Electronics Technician, CO 4 said he would be\nat the institution the follouing day to provide the Electronics Technician access to the room, so the\nElectronics Technician decided to postpone the repair until the follouing day. The Electronics Technician\nsaid his decision was influenced by the fact that he had historically been told by MCC New York supervisors\nthat such maters did not have to be atended to until the follouing day, and even if he had replaced the\nhard drives that day, the rebuilding process would have taken 24 hours to complete and would therefore\nnot have finished until the follouing day anyway.\nC. SHU Camera Locations and Operational Status on August lo\nThe Electronics Technician arrived at the institution around 6 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, and shortly\nthereafter, before he could begin working on the DVR system, he heard the staff body alarm sound and he\nreported to the SHU to assist. Later that day he was asked to pull potential video from cameras located in\nand around the SHU. The Electronics Technician eventually determined that most of the cameras in the\nSHU area were assigned to record to DVR 2. While the cameras assigned to DVR 2 were providing live video\nstreams on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, no recordings from those cameras were available due to the DVR 2 hard\ndrive issue, which the FBI later determined had occurred on July 29, 2ol9. Among the cameras whose video\nwas not recorded was the camera at the end of L Tier, the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed.\n52 The DVR system was located in a locked room, and access to the room was limited to the institution's SIS unit, staff\nassigned to inmate phone monitoring, and the Electronics Technicians.\n84\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023461.jpg": "Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\nI. Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span>\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023464.jpg": "management failures at multiple levels within the BOP.*” Similar to the Bulger report, the numerous and\nserious transgressions that occurred in this mater came to light largely because they involved a high-profile\ninmate. The fact that serious deficiencies occurred in connection with high-profile inmates like Epstein and\nBulger is especially concerning given that the BOP would presumably take particular care in handling the\ncustody and care of such inmates.\nRegretably, the OIG has encountered similar issues on many other occasions. For example, the OIG has\ninvestigated numerous allegations related to the falsification of official BOP documentation concerning\ninmate counts and rounds, several of which have resulted in criminal prosecution. The OIG currently has\ntwo open investigations into allegations of falsified inmate count and round documentation, each involving\nan inmate death (by suicide and homicide) or escape from a BOP facility.\nThis investigation and review also revealed the direct impact of insufficient staffing levels on inmate safety.\nWitnesses repeatedly told the OIG that counts, rounds, cell searches, and other methods of inmate\naccountability were not undertaken because <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> staff were working multiple shifts—including one\nstaff member who worked 24-hours straight—and were tired and overwhelmed with other duties. As\ndiscussed in greater detail in our recommendations, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to\naddress staffing shortages. Most recently, in March 2o23, the OIG found that the coronavirus disease 2ol9\n(COVID-l9) pandemic exacerbated the effects of preexisting BOP medical and nonmedical staffing\nshortages, an issue the OIG has identified as a concern for the BOP since at least 2ol5.°°\nFurther, the OIG has repeatedly found that BOP personnel have not consistently been atentive to the needs\nof inmates at risk for suicide. In this investigation, that inatention manifested in the failure of MCC\nNew York staff and supervisors to ensure that Epstein was assigned a cellmate as required by the MCC\nNew York Psychology Department directive issued after the July 23, 2ol9 incident in which Epstein was\ndiscovered in his cell with an orange cloth around his neck. In a March 2o23 report, the OIG found that BOP\npsychology staff did not assess the suitability of single-cell assignments for five of the seven inmates who\ndied by suicide while in COVID-l9 quarantine units between March 2o2o and April 2o2l.°? The OIG’s 2ol7\nreport on the BOP’s use of restrictive housing for inmates with mental illness also noted that single-celling\nmay present risks to inmate mental health, and both of the recommendations from that report regarding\nthe use and oversight of single-celling remain open as of March 2o23.\nLastly, as discussed in greater detail in the conclusions and recommendations that follou, the persistent\ndeficiencies of the BOP’s security camera systems are well documented and long-standing.\n57 U.S. DOJ OIG, Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Handling of the Transfer of Inmate James “Whitey”\nBulger, 23-oo7 (December 2o22).\n*8 U.S. DOJ OIG, Capstone Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2ol9 Pandemic,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division A-2o2o-oll (March 2o23) (Capstone Report).\n5° Capstone Report.\n6 U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation\nand Inspections Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7).\n\n97\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23464\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023469.jpg": "email identifying the cellmate requirement; and the statements of multiple witnesses who told the OIG that\nEpstein’s cellmate requirement was widely disseminated verbally by MCC New York leadership.\nB. MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct Mandatory Rounds and Inmate Counts\nResulting in Epstein Being Unobserved for Hours Before His Death\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, MCC New York SHU staff did not\nconduct the mandatory rounds and inmate counts during their shift in the SHU. The failure to undertake\nthese required measures to account for inmate whereabouts and wellbeing—and the supervisors’ failure to\nproperly supervise the SHU staff, as discussed further belou—resulted in Epstein being unobserved for\nhours before his death, which compounded the failure of MCC New York staff to ensure that Epstein had an\nappropriate cellmate.\nl. Failure to Conduct Rounds and Inmate Counts in the SHU\nFederal regulations require that employees “use official time in an honest effort to perform official duties.””!\nAdditionally, BOP standards of conduct required that employees “[c]onduct themselves in a manner that\nfosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.””* Because\n“[i]Jnatention to duty in a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other incidents,”\nBOP standards of conduct also require employees “to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.”\nBOP policy also requires “[c]ontinuous inmate accountability,” which is accomplished through rounds and\ninmate counts.’”? Among other things, rounds and inmate counts enable staff to observe inmates and\nensure that they are safe and secure in their cells and are in good health.\nBOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders set out the requirements for these inmate accountability\nmeasures, specifying that <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> staff must conduct rounds on an irregular schedule at least twice\neach hour, no more than 4o minutes apart. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders further specify\nthat at least two MCC New York SHU staff members must conduct inmate counts at l2 a.m., 3.a.m.,5a.m.,\n4 p.m., and lo p.m. daily, and also at lo a.m. on weekends and federal holidays.\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that an inmate (Inmate 4) was internally transferred from the\nSHU to Receiving and Discharge at approximately 3:l5 p.m. on August 9, 2ol9; houever, this inmate transfer\nwas not documented until approximately l2:35 a.m. on August lo, 2ol9. Based on this internal transfer,\nBOP records, and witness statements, the OIG determined that the 4 p.m. and lo p.m. SHU inmate counts\non August 9 were erroneous. In addition, the OIG reviewed the available SHU security camera video, which\ndid not shou COs walking up or doun the stairs leading to the various SHU tiers during the count times, a\nprocess that is necessary to conduct an accurate count of inmates.”* During their OIG interviews, the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, CO Tova Noel, and Material Handler Michael\nThomas each admited that they did not conduct all of the mandatory rounds and inmate counts in the SHU\n™ 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. 8 2635.lol(b)(5).\n7 BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\n® BOP Program Statement 55oo.l4.\n™ As discussed in Chapter 5, the OIG found that the security camera video was of lou quality.

The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

Mental health, custody, and unit team employees\nwork collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed\nappropriately.\nRecommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for\nsuicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the\nrecommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate\nre-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security\nconsiderations.\nBOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to\nRecommendation l, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological\nobservation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.\nUpon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care\nrecommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP\nthoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at\nmoderate to high risk for suicide.\nRecommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and\ndocumenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or\npsychological observation, which allous for institution-specific variations in the process, and\nprovide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to\nmitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological\nobservation.\n\nll6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23483\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023489.jpg": "<u Of >\nCS on\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL\nJune 27, 2o23\nDO] OIG Releases Report on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan\n<span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center in New York, New York\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) Inspector General Michael E. Horouitz announced today the release of a report\nof investigation regarding the Federal Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of Jeffrey\nEpstein while detained at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center in New York, New York (MCC New\nYork). Epstein died by suicide on August lo, 2ol9 while in BOP custody. The focus of DO] Office of the\nInspector General's (OIG) investigation was the conduct of BOP personnel.\nThe DO] OIG investigation and review identified:\n\ne Numerous and Serious Failures by MCC New York Staff. The DO) OIG found numerous and serious\nfailures by MCC New York staff constituting misconduct and dereliction of their duties. Among other\nthings, these failures resulted in Epstein being unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in\nhis locked cell on August lo at approximately 6:3o a.m.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Was Assigned a Cellmate. Follouing a July 23,\n2ol9, incident that resulted in Epstein being placed on suicide watch, the MCC New York\nPsychology Department determined that Epstein needed to be housed with an appropriate\ncellmate. On August 9, Epstein’s cell mate was transferred out of MCC New York. MCC New York\nstaff knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate but did not take steps to ensure that he was\nassigned a new cellmate.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Undertake Required Measures Designed to Ensure that Epstein\nand Other Inmates Were Accounted for and Safe. BOP policy requires Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) staff to observe all inmates, conduct rounds, conduct inmate counts, search inmate cells,\nand ensure adequate supervision of the SHU. BOP staff in the SHU in the hours before Epstein’s\ndeath failed to carry out these responsibilities. Specifically, only one SHU cell search was\ndocumented on August 9, and it was not of Epstein’s cell. BOP records did not indicate when\nEpstein’s cell was last searched. Had Epstein's cell been searched as required, the search would\nhave revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and clothing in his cell. The OIG\nalso found that SHU staff did not conduct any 3o-minute rounds after about lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9 and that none of the required SHU inmate counts were conducted after 4:oo p.m. on\nAugust 9. MCC New York staff falsified count slips and round sheets to shou that they had been\nperformed when they were not, leaving Epstein unobserved for hours before his\ndeath. Follouing a DOJ OIG investigation, two MCC New York employees were charged\ncriminally with falsifying BOP records. The charges were dismissed upon compliance by the\nemployees with the terms of deferred prosecution agreements they entered into with the U.S.\nAtorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. That office declined prosecution for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only\nbecause the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to\nquestions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous\nvictims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span>\ninstitutions. The BOP agreed with all recommendations.\nReport: Today's report and an interactive timeline of events can be found on the OIG's website at the\nfollouing link: htps://oig.justice.gov/reports/investigation-and-review-federal-bureau-prisons-custody-care-\nand-supervision-jeffrey\nVideo: To accompany today’s report, the OIG has released a 3-minute video of the Inspector General\ndiscussing the report's findings.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023495.jpg": "< ea] orrassig. | ___inmatename | Reg.No_| Unit | laDate |staus| rros | ost Admiting Officer\n\nSe ; ia foe), (TNC)\n\n+ Zo4-2o6LAD | EPSTEIN, JEFFREY EDWARD 763l8-o54 a o7-29-2ol9 nn ee es\n: \\ Reason: PENDING DHO FOR CODE 228 SELF-MUTILATION\nPsychology Services Comments: Health Services Comments:\nUnit Team Comments: <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Services Comments:\n\nPENDING DHO FOR CODE 228 SELF-MUTILATION/ INMATE SUICIDE ATTEMPT ON 7-23-2ol9\nPage 7 of 27\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023496.jpg": "Fwd: RE: United States v.

They claimed the Court has inherent\nauthority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is\nimportant. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. | haven't\nlooked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska writen by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan)\nconcerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense\ncounsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a\nparticular situation. (Again, | haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also\nasked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel\nobviously didn't knou that Adam & | give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go\nto SHU.)\nVarious atorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the \"timing of Epstein's death is curious\" and most\nof them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they\nadmited there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.\nThe government did not say much except pointing out the lack of jurisdiction for the Court's involvement.\nThey also said that it was up to individual defendants and their counsel to address any complaints at MCC\nwith the judge presiding over their case.\nThen we proceeded to hear statements from Epstein's victims for over 2.5 hours. | won't rehash the\nstatements, but some were very detailed accounts of rape/assault. Many of the victims expressed anger at\nthe government and MCC for Epstein's death. Some of them seconded defense counsel's request for court\noversight in the investigation. Some bought into the conspiracy theories. Many of them asked for Epstein's\nco-conspirators to be charged & brought to justice.\nAt the end of the conference, Judge Berman did not dismiss the case. He simply thanked the victims and\nended it. | expect he will decide whether to grant the nolle pros and whether to get involved in the\ninvestigation at a later date, probably in a writen opinion.\nAnyway, | wanted to give an update while my notes were fresh. Please let me knou if you have any\nquestions/concerns.

The procedures outlined belou\nhave been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmited as revisions\nhave been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.\nl. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center (MCC),\nNew York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.\n2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a\nmental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental\nstatus), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate\nis no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general\npopulation or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological\nobservation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal\n(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to\nhis/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,\ndisorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.\nPsychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until\nsuch time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in\ngeneral population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an\ninpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n3. PROCEDURES: The follouing are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:\nA. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an\ninmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an\ninmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |\nObservation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff\n(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food\nService Administrator, and Duty Officer.\nB. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not\nfeasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The\ninmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a\nDOJ-OGR-ooo239ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023913.jpg": "Fwd: counsel having difficulty meeting with client\nFrom\nTo\nDate 2ol9/o7/o7 2o:5o\nSubject: Fwd: counsel having difficulty meeting with client\nAtachments: TEXT. htm\nCaptain\nMetropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Center\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, NY looo7\nOffice: (646) at |\nBlackberry (646\n>> bop.gov> 7/7/2ol9 6:22 PM >>>\n| have veritie Ss an atorney in good standing in Massachusets.

A copy of the video is normally made by Special\nInvestigative Staff follouing a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since\nthe original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the\nbeginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely\nlimited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish\nconverging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,\ninformation typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support\nactionable findings and recommendations is limited.\nName: Jeffrey Epstein\nRegister Number: 763l8-o54\nDate of Death: o8-lo-2ol9\nPrepared by: National Suicide Prevention Coordinator,\nPsychology Services Branch, Central Office\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\nMr. Jeffrey Epstein was a 66-year-old, White male who died on August lo, 2ol9, while housed\nat the Metropolitan <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Complex (MCC), in New York, New York. James C.

This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2482o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024822.jpg": "Page 284\nInstitutional History: On July 6, 2ol9, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in\nNew Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR PDS-BEMR)E | Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level | and\nwas not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nFollouing a consultation wi National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on\nJuly 8, 2 erp at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein\nshould be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours.

On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\n|.

This was a significant\ndisappointment for Mr. Epstein and likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt\nto incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge’s decision, a psychologist\nshould have assessed Mr. Epstein’s mental status upon his return to the institution. The\nBOP developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used “to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider\nthe special psychological and management-related risks associated with the inmate.”\nFurthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert Function states, “When a decision to\nmove [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the inmate\nare reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security\nconcerns are highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.”\n\nSS Eee\n\nBoth of these groups of inmates are\nsusceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> setings and experience\nstress associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes,\nmovement to and from court, institutional movement, and release of information through\nthe media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9.

On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s\nprison account revealed one of his atorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate\nReyes) commissary account for unknoun reasons.\nHEALTH CARE AND PERSONALITY DESCRIPTION\nBOP Electronic Medical Records (BEMR) indicate Mr. Epstein was diagnosed with\nhyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis\nunspecified. He was prescribed the follouing mediations: docusate sodium, milk of magnesia,\nomega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records. Any\nrecords that may have been maintained relating to Mr. Epstein’s incarceration in Florida were\nnot available for review as of the date of this report. With regard to Psychology Data System\nrecords in BEMR (PDS-BEMRP Forensic Psychologist at\nMCC New York completed a routine Intake Screening on July 8, 2ol9. During this screening,\nMr. Epstein denied any history of mental health problems, substance abuse, and treatment. No\nsymptoms of mental illness were observed. He was classified as Mental Health Care Level | and\nwas not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nFollouing a consultation wit National Suicide Prevention Coordinator on\nJuly 8, 2ol9 hief Psychologist at MCC New York determined Mr. Epstein\nshould be pre-emptively evaluated for suicide risk upon his return from court. Primary\nconsideration was given to his various risk factors for suicide such as his high profile case and\nmedia atention, pending sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and an ongoing court proceeding.\nMr. Epstein returned from court on July 8, 2ol9, after normal business hours.

On the day before his death, a number of documents in his case were\nunsealed, further eroding his previously-enjoyed elevated status and potentially implicating some\nof his associates. The lack of significant interpersonal connections, a complete loss of his status\nin both the community and among associates, and the idea of potentially spending his life in\nprison were likely factors contributing to Mr. Epstein’s suicide.\nThe follouing recommendations concern institution operations:\nl.

This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and\nlikely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's\ndecision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP\ndeveloped a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.\nSpecifically PSY ALERT is used \"to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological\nand management-related risks associated with the inmate.\" Furthermore, P5324.o7, SENTRY Psychology Alert\nFunction states, \"When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the\ninmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are\nhighlighted for non-Psychology Services staff.\" Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more\nfrequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these\ngroups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> setings and experience stress\nassociated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,\ninstitutional movement, and release of information through the media).\nMr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 3l, 2ol9. It is unknoun what time he departed or returned to MCC New\nYork because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals\nService (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice\nindicated Mr. Epstein had \"MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies.\" The USMS requested R&D staff sign the\nform, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August l, 2ol9, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-\nmail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about\nthis notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate\nand procedures should have been folloued as outlined in P5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when\na staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff\nmember must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is\nplaced on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these\nconditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. Bi, [or a suicide risk assessment on\nAugust l, 2ol9, at approximately l:3o p.m.\nInstitution Response: 7. Follou Up:\nStaff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant\nwhen they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is\nplaced on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.\n\nAs part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the follouing: “If you are emailing about an inmate\nthat may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation. Please make sure that you make contact\nfi\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo25l2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00025122.jpg": "Page 76o\n\nWhen an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department\nreturns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal's Office, they will be screened by a\nmember of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress\nregarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.\nPer guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with\nR&D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and\nsuicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology\nServices Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting. Further, an e-mail regarding\nPSY ALERT procedures was sent to all Lieutenants, Receiving and Discharge (R&D), Psychology and Health\nServices staff.\n8.

The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.\nMoreover, the four suicide watch cells nou all have SENTRY Assignments of HoOl-oolL —HOol-oo4L. Further,\nPsychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants\nhave conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly\nrounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain\nand the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.\nThe Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP3o Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on\nsuicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments\ncorrectly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the\nLieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that\nupon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell\nassignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP3o with the selection category for suicide watch. The\nOperations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is\nin the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate\nbed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.\nAdditionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when\nthe need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the\nWarden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate\nwhether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned.

This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\n\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either.

It is unknoun whether he was anticipating this\narrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that\nevening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22\nhours. On July 7, 2ol9, at approximately 7:2o p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit\n(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness\nof his notoriety among the inmate population.\nWith regard to his adjustment to a <span class=\"highlight\">correctional</span> seting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report\nwhile in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2ol9. As of August l5, 2ol9, the incident\nreport had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether\nMr. Epstein knew this.

Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the\nprescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.\nHouever, the dates for which it was prescribed have a notation indicating “dose not indicated,”\nthus it does not appear insulin was routinely medically necessary. The rest of the medications\nprescribed were self-carry. He also had a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine\nwhich is typically used to treat sleep apnea. Mr. Epstein was provided with his personal CPAP\nmachine on July 3o, 2ol9, per BEMR.\nIn regard to mental health history and treatment, there are no knoun available records.

He was\nsmiling and did crack some jokes during the interview. He did elucidate some complaints and suggested being\ndisappointed with this writer as he wants \"to trust me and for me to trust him.\" He stated he remains unhappy with legal\nvisiting procedures as he cannot go to the bathroom as frequently as he would like to since he has a \"weak bladder.\"\nInmate Epstein also reported since coming to the psychological observation area, he has felt constipated and needs his\nColace. He had self-carry Colace in SHU, but since coming to the observation area, he has not had his medication.\nThis writer immediately notified medical and his pills were being processed during the interview. Inmate Epstein also\ncontinues to complain about the conditions of SHU confinement (i-e., feeling punished, smells, noise, and restrictions).\nHe does not exhibit\nsymptoms of any cognitive disorder, seizure disorder, psychotic disorder, or dissociative disorder at this time or in the\npast. Inmate Epstein denied any current suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He reported wanting to be alive to fight his\nlegal case and go back and live life. He referred to himself as \"a couard\" and \"I'm Jewish.\" He said he is not the type\nwho likes pain or would ever atempt to harm himself.\nWhile on psychological observation, inmate Epstein has been eating his meals, sleeping and interacting with the inmate\ncompanions. He is in legal visiting the majority of the day and in the evenings. His log book and eating/shouer chart\nreflect the same. He has been speaking to inmate companions about investment strategies and about prison\nadjustment. <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Staff report during his legal visits, he is interacting with his atorney, animated, laughing, and\njoking.\nIntervention(s)\nInmate Epstein was provided with supportive and coping skills interventions today.

James C.

This\nreconstruction was established in accordance with Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Program Statement\n5324.o8, Suicide Prevention Program.\n\nSocial History: Mr. Epstein did not have a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) available at the time of\nthe reconstruction; therefore, no official information regarding social history was accessible.\nThe follouing was gathered from publicly available documents. Mr. Epstein was born in l953\nand grew up in a middle-class family in the neighborhood of Sea Gate on Coney Island,\nBrooklyn, New York, with one brother. After early promotion in two grades, Mr. Epstein\ngraduated from Lafayete High School in l969, at the age of l6. He atended Cooper Union and\nNew York University but did not graduate from either. Mr. Epstein taught at the Dalton School,\na private school on the Upper East Side of Manhatan from September l974 until he was\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo27283\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027287.jpg": "Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required\nby P55oo.l4, <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Service Procedures Manual.\n\n9. Atorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured follouing Mr. Epstein’s death.\nSpecifically, three Atorney Log Books located in the Atorney Visiting and Front Lobby\nareas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Atorney Visiting area were not\nsecured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the\nreconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.o8 states, “In the event of a\nsuicide, institution staff, particularly <span class=\"highlight\">Correctional</span> Services staff, and other law\nenforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime\nscene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence\nand documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent\ninvestigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”\n\nFurther, a review of the atorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic\nconcern. For example, there were two concurrently open atorney log books in the\nAtorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two atorney log books, one\nin the Atorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff\nwere unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the\nreconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,\nentries were made out of chronological order, atorneys did not consistently sign in and\nout, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently\nlabeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been\ntorn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an\nadequate system of control and monitoring.\n\nlo.
