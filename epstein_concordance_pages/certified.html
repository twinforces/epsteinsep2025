Among its\ndeficiencies are these:\n(l) The bail package is not accompanied or supported by audited or <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> financial |\nstatements, including details of income and expenses and debt obligations. There is no affidavit |\nfrom Mr. Epstein. As noted, Defense counsel submited a cursory one page “Asset Summary - |\nJune 3o, 2ol9\" on Mr. Epstein’s behalf in which he discloses several categories of assets totaling |\n$559,l2o,954. The Defense states that it “would be impossible for Epstein — given, among other :\n!\nimpediments, his detention, inability to quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly |\nmake a precise valuation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement by the |\nCourt’s 5 pm deadline.” Dkt. 23 at 4. |\nThe absence of accurate and comprehensive financials, sworn to by the Defendant, does |\nnot allou the Court meaningfully to assess Defendants’ oun proposed bail package nor would it |\nenable the Court to fashion a bail package on its oun. The Court would not be able to determine :\nwhat level of bail — in relation to Epstein’s finances ~ would reasonably assure the Defendant’s |\nappearance. Defense counsel proposed at the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9 that it would take a |\nfew days to prepare accurate financials for Mr. Epstein. He also suggested that he would do so\n(only) if the Court were agreeable to granting bail. This “offer” appears disingenuous for a\nperson as wealthy and experienced in financial maters as Mr. Epstein. See Tr. 7/l5/l9 at 5o |\n(Court: “There needs to be a fuller financial picture to knou what would be appropriate.”\nDefense Counsel: “Let me be blunt. It was our first effort ....”).

Among its\ndeficiencies are these:\n(l) The bail package is not accompanied or supported by audited or <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> financial |\nstatements, including details of income and expenses and debt obligations. There is no affidavit |\nfrom Mr. Epstein. As noted, Defense counsel submited a cursory one page “Asset Summary - |\nJune 3o, 2ol9\" on Mr. Epstein’s behalf in which he discloses several categories of assets totaling |\n$559,l2o,954. The Defense states that it “would be impossible for Epstein — given, among other :\n!\nimpediments, his detention, inability to quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly |\nmake a precise valuation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement by the |\nCourt’s 5 pm deadline.” Dkt. 23 at 4. |\nThe absence of accurate and comprehensive financials, sworn to by the Defendant, does |\nnot allou the Court meaningfully to assess Defendants’ oun proposed bail package nor would it |\nenable the Court to fashion a bail package on its oun. The Court would not be able to determine :\nwhat level of bail — in relation to Epstein’s finances ~ would reasonably assure the Defendant’s !\nappearance. Defense counsel proposed at the bail hearing on July l5, 2ol9 that it would take a |\nfew days to prepare accurate financials for Mr. Epstein. He also suggested that he would do so\n(only) if the Court were agreeable to granting bail. This “offer” appears disingenuous for a\nperson as wealthy and experienced in financial maters as Mr. Epstein. See Tr. 7/l5/l9 at 5o |\n(Court: “There needs to be a fuller financial picture to knou what would be appropriate.”\nDefense Counsel: “Let me be blunt. It was our first effort ....”). That Mr. Epstein does not have\na financial statement, including liabilities and expenses, readily available is difficult to\nunderstand.\n29\n—— DOJ-OGR-ooooo8l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000817.jpg": "Case l9-222l, Document 4-l, o7/23/2ol9, 26l468l, Page of l\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nThurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse\n4o Foley Square\nNew York, NY looo7\nROBERT A.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to\ndelay disclosure. Houever, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8\nweeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,\nwhich are not voluminous, to the defense by March l2, 2o2l. Disclosure of the\nmaterials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see\nDkt. No. 36.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a <span class=\"highlight\">Certified</span> Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District.

See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o.

See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance.

The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by ae. a <span class=\"highlight\">Certified</span> Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, Lo investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. p reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool993\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 97-l6 Filed l2/l4/2o Page 2 of 4\n\nz i. am a forensic accountant and private investigator, and the\nouner ay o6oUmUmt~<“‘<‘<‘<‘SseC*@ I received a BA in Economics from\nLehman College in l973 and an advanced degree in Personal Financial Planning\nfrom Lehman College in l997.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter regarding birth certificates that are marked\nas Government Exhibits for trial.! By way of background, the Government has obtained and\nproduced to the defense <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> copies of the birth certificates for each of the Minor Victims.\n(See GX-ll-l6). Although the Government has asked the defense to stipulate to the authenticity\nof these records, and although the defense has identified no reason to doubt the authenticity of\nthese records, the defense has not agreed to a stipulation. Accordingly, the Government seeks the\nrelief in the instant motion, to which it is entitled under the law, and to avoid calling records\ncustodians from five state agencies with custody over the birth certificates.\n\n' The Government moves to file a redacted version this leter motion. The proposed redactions\nare consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.\nof Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Although this leter motion is a judicial document\nsubject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the privacy interests of victims, including victims who have not been publicly identified,\nand who are a subject of the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain victims and witnesses\ntestify under pseudonyms, and third parties.\n\n? The Government is coordinating with Department of Justice Office of International Affairs to\nfurther establish the predicates for self-authentication of Witness-3’s birth certificate and will\nmake the appropriate motion when it is ripe. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(3).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo74ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007402.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the birth certificates are self-authenticating under Rule 9o2\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence, and no records custodian should be required to testify. The\nexhibits should be determined to be self-authenticating.\nl. Applicable Law\nRule 9o2 contains a list of items that are “self-authenticating,” that is “they require no\nextrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admited.” Fed. R. Evid. 9o2. Under Rule 9o2(4),\nthat list includes:\n<span class=\"highlight\">Certified</span> Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official record\n— or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public\noffice as authorized by law — if the copy is <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> as correct by:\n(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the\ncertification; or\n(B) a certificate that complies with Rule 9o2(l), (2), or (3), a\nfederal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.\nRule 9o2(l), in turn, provides for self-authentication of the follouing:\nDomestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed. A\ndocument that bears:\n(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state,\ndistrict, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of\nthe United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust\nTerritory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of\nany of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of\nany entity named above; and\n(B) asignature purporting to be an execution or atestation.\nFinally, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 27 permits a party to “prove an official record\n... in the same manner as in a civil action.” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(l), in turn,\npermits proof of a domestic “official record” that is “otherwise admissible and is kept within the\nUnited States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory” through\nDOJ-OGR- oooo74o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 488 _ Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\na copy atested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or\n\nby the officer's deputy—and accompanied by a certificate that the\n\nofficer has custody. The certificate must be made under seal:\n\n... (it) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official\n\nduties in the district or political subdivision where the record is kept.\nFed. R Civ. P. 44(a)(l); see Fed. R. Evid. 9o2 Advisory Commitee Notes (“Rule 44(a) of the\nRules of Civil Procedure and Rule 27 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure have provided\nauthentication procedures of this nature for both domestic and foreign public records.”).\n\nIl. Discussion\n\nThe Minor Victims’ birth certificates are <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> and sealed by the appropriate officials,\nand are therefore self-authenticating under Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4). See Ball v. A.O. Smith Corp.,\n45l F.3d 66, 7l (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“The original transcript, which includes a certification by the court\nreporter, is self-authenticating. See Fed. R. Evid. 9o2(4).”); United States v. McGee, 439 F. App'x\n837, 839 (llth Cir. 2oll) (“We have held that to satisfy the requirements of Rule 9o2(4), a\ncertification need only identify the legal custodian's position of authority, and that the copy is true\nand correct.”).\n\nAt the threshold, domestic birth certificates are “public records” within the meaning of\nFederal Rule of Evidence 9o2(4). See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(9) (providing a hearsay exception for\n“Public Records of Vital Statistics,” including “[a] record of a birth . . . if reported to a public\noffice in accordance with a legal duty.”).\n\nPursuant to Rule 9o2(4)(A), a copy of such a record is self-authenticating if “<span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> as\ncorrect by: . . . the custodian or another person authorized to make the certification.” Fed. R. Evid.\n9o2(4)(A).

Evid. 4ol, 4o2, 4o3.\n\n“A picture may .. . be inadmissible, although technically accurate, because it portrays a\nscene that is materially different from a scene that is relevant to one of the issues at trial.” United\nStates v. Stearns, 55o F.2d ll67, ll7o (9th Cir. l977). And when a “photograph fails to portray\nthe relevant facts with complete accuracy, such as if changed conditions have occurred, it may be\nmisleading.” § 2l5. Photographs, 2 McCormick on Evid. § 2l5 (8th ed.).’\n\nThe government has not met its burden of proof here. The charged conspiracy ended in\n2oo4. And Jane claims she was at Mr. Epstein’s New York apartment in l994 or l995 or l996.\n\n* The government relies on just two cases to support its argument: United States v.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Certified</span> Env.

This testimony may cover\nany exhibits offered by the Government.\n\nMr. Kelso's testimony may also encompass the metadata associated with defense\nexhibits, including testimony about the values contained in certain metadata fields and their\nmeaning. Because the defense cannot anticipate at this juncture which exhibits may be\nnecessary, depending upon evidence offered by the government during its case in chief, the\ndefense reserves the right to disclose the metadata testimony from Mr. Kelso at the same time\nit identifies any particular exhibit that it will introduce as impeachment or rebutal exhibits.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll95\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011365.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 723 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3ofl3\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Though,\n2o to be clear, the government, as I said, will still need to\n2l authenticate that the photos are of Epstein's apartment in\n22 2ol9.\n23 In any event, even if analyzed under Rule 9l, as I'll\n24 discuss belou in a moment, Jane's testimony about the\n25 distinctive characteristics of Epstein's apartment captured in\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 75l Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll of 26l ll5l\nLC6Cmaxl\n\nl because they're likely to distract or confuse jurors.\n\n2 With those photos redacted from the photos, I do\n\n3 conclude the probative value of the photos of the massage room\n4 is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.

The Court\n2o will exclude these photos.\n2l First, these items are highly moveable, such that a\n22 photo taken decades later is not probative of the items that\n23 Epstein ouned at the time that Jane testified she was abused.\n24 Second, the government has not presented any testimony\n25 that the massagers in the photos match or are similar to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool8348\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019257.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel9 of l9\nresponse to the Court's Order of August l8, 2o2o Document filed by USA.\n(Rossmiller, Alex) (Entered: o8/2l/2o2o)\n\no8/24/2o2o | 48 | LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J.

(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: o3/23/2o2l)\n\no3/24/2o2l | l72 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard\nfor Rule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the\nground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3)\nprovides that \"[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of\npersonal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only\nby court order,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can\nmove to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3).\nConsistent with the Rule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court\nrequired defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or\nconfidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

The Court also\ngave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the\nsubpoena as required by Rule l7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter\nfrom the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose\npersonal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.\nRay, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o)\n(\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the\nvictim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or\nbefore March 26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing\nof objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm\nmay reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).\nCounsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO\nORDERED.

Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a <span class=\"highlight\">Certified</span> Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. Dl reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020144.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag Pagefl Tost 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set financial\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a <span class=\"highlight\">Certified</span> Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020399.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel3 of 9l\n\no8/25/2o2o | 49 | MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER: denying without prejudice 38 LETTER\nMOTION as to Ghislaine Maxwell (l).

The law firm\nshall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that leter, the law firm\nalso interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims\nit represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,\neven though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial\nbriefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall\nenter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket.

If the victim objects, the Court\nwill then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds\nthat Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the\nlaw firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer\nwith defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the\nobjections.

On March 5, 2o2l, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell\nsubmited to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to\nRule l7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was\ndirected at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for\nRule l7(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground\nthat it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule l7(c)(3) provides that \"\n[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or\nconfidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court\norder,\" but \"before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the\ncourt must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or\nmodify the subpoena or otherwise object.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3). Consistent with the\nRule, on March l2, 2o2l, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel\nto provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be\ndisclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an\nopportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule\nl7(c)(3). On March l9, 2o2l, the Court received a leter from the law firm indicating that\nit can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may\nbe elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims\nit represents. In that leter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of\nthe law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the\nequivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the\nCourt can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion\nto quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public\ndocket. See United States v. Ray, No. 2o-CR-llo (LJL), 2o2o WL 6939677, at *lo\n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o) (\"[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal\nor confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given\nnotice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the\nCourt will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on\ngrounds that Nixon was not satisfied.\"). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,\nthe law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be\nnarroued before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with\ndefense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.\nThe law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March\n26, 2o2l. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Within one week of the filing of objections,\ndefense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within\nthree days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation l on this Order). Counsel shall\nconfer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED.

As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds are two\nmeans by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being. BOP and\nMCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility\nat designated times each day. Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member\nobserve all SHU inmates at least once during the first 3o minutes of each hour (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.)\nand again during the second 3o minutes of the hour (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates\nare observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 3o-minute\nrounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”\nDuring the OIG's investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York\nSHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2ol9, at approximately 4 p.m.,\nuntil Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August lo, 2ol9. Houever, in documentation\ncompleted by the SHU staff on duty during that period, staff members falsely <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> in the count slips that\nthey had conducted the required counts. Additionally, the OIG investigation revealed that the staff assigned\nto the MCC New York SHU did not conduct any required 3o-minute rounds of inmates after approximately\nlo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9. Again, houever, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> in\nthe round sheet that the required rounds were conducted. The combination of these and other failures led\nto Epstein being unmonitored and locked alone in his cell, which the OIG found contained an excessive\namount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9 until he was discovered hanged in his cell\nat approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records related to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said\nthey did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than\nsuicide. Additionally, none of the l5 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this\ninvestigation, lo of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and lo, had any credible information\nsuggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Further, the SHU staff and the\nthree interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that\nno one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of\nAugust 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU. SHU staff\ntold the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were locked in their cells for the\nevening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could have goten out of their cells.\nAdditionally, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common\narea of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's\nrecording issues that we detail in this report. The OIG's analysis of the recorded video did not identify any\nCorrectional Officers (CO) or other individuals approaching any of the SHU tiers, including the L Tier where\n2 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute\nCheck Sheet.”\n3 For reasons we describe belou, while the camera inside the L Tier was working and transmiting live video, the video\nwas not being recorded.\n\n3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2337o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023373.tif": "referred to as a “round sheet’) falsely stating that she and Thomas had conducted such rounds when, in\nfact, they had not.°\nOn November l9, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York\nreturned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple\ncounts each of falsification of records, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, lool(a)(3), and 2. The indictment\nalleged that on August 9, 2ol9, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and lo p.m. counts of inmates\nin the MCC New York SHU, and that on August lo, 2ol9, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the\nmandatory l2 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 3o-minute rounds within the MCC New York\nSHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span>, and submited false\ndocumentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to\nperform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,\nincluding Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from\napproximately lo:4o p.m. on August 9, 2ol9, until approximately 6:3o a.m. on August lo, 2ol9, when\nEpstein was found hanged in his cell.\nOn May 25, 2o2l, the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred\nprosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court\nrecord in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> that they had\nconducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely\ndisclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the\nU.S. Atorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete loo hours of\ncommunity service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision\nand their establishment of good behavior. On December l3, 2o2l, after Noel and Thomas successfully\nfulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all\ncharges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> inmate count\nslips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\nAs discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and\nThomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor\njudgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.\nI. Methodology\nDuring the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one\noccasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the\nSHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,\nAssociate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC\nNew York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had\n5 These BOP forms are officially entitled “Official Count Slip” and “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 3o Minute Check\nSheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had l3 entries reflecting 3o-minute\nrounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23373\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023430.tif": "count slip.7° During his OIG interview, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge reviewed BOP documents\nregarding the inmate's transfer from the SHU and acknouledged further that based on that transfer, the\nnumber of inmates listed on the SHU count slip he and Noel submited for the 4 p.m. count, the count slip\nwas incorrect.\nNoel admited in the deferred prosecution agreement she entered into with the U.S. Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of New York that she completed false count slips on August 9 and lo. Noel initially told\nthe OIG that she did not conduct the 4 p.m. count on August 9, but after acknouledging that she signed the\n4 p.m. SHU count slip, Noel said she did not recall if she conducted the count. According to Noel, she and\nother SHU staff filled out the count slip before conducting the counts because they knew the number of\ninmates they were supposed to report.\n2. The lo p.m. SHU Count on August 9\nAt the time of the lo p.m. count, all inmates in the MCC New York SHU, including Epstein, were locked in\ntheir cells for the night. At or around that time, the two officers assigned to the SHU were responsible for\nconducting the lo p.m. stand up count. At lo p.m. on August 9, the two assigned SHU officers were Noel\nand the Material Handler. Through review and analysis of the SHU security camera video, witness\nstatements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that MCC New York staff did not perform the lo p.m.\ncount in the SHU.?”? Nonetheless, Noel and the Material Handler completed and signed the lo p.m. SHU\ncount slip. The lo p.m. SHU count slip listed the total number of inmates as “73 + l.” According to the MCC\nNew York master count sheet for the lo p.m. count on August 9, 2ol9, all units had verbally reported their\ninmate counts to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m.#8 At approximately lo:36 p.m., the Control Center\ncompleted all paperwork and officially cleared the lo p.m. institutional count.\nThe Material Handler said he was present at the time of the lo p.m. count, but that the count was not\nconducted because everyone was tired. The Material Handler noted that on August 9, he had worked an\novertime shift from l2 a.m. until 8 a.m., his regular shift from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., folloued by his SHU overtime\nshift from 4 p.m. to midnight. Thus, at the time of the lo p.m. count, he had worked 22 consecutive hours at\nMCC New York. The Material Handler verified that he and Noel signed the lo p.m. count slip and believed\nthat Noel called the Control Center with their count numbers. He did not knou why the count slip listed\n\"73 + l\",\nNoel told the OIG that she had conducted the SHU count alone at lo p.m. and that the Material Handler\nsigned the count slip even though he did not conduct the count with her. Houever, the OIG’s review and\nanalysis of the SHU security camera video conflicts with Noel’s statement that she conducted the lo p.m.\ncount. Specifically, the video reflects that it was not until between lo:29 p.m. and lo:36 p.m. when Noel\nwalked to different tiers inside the SHU. Yet, as described above, MCC New York records reflect that counts\nfrom all MCC New York housing units were reported to the Control Center by lo:3o p.m., as the count\n36 Prosecution was declined for BOP employees (other than Noel and Thomas) who falsely <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span> inmate counts and\nrounds on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.\n37 The quality of the SHU video footage was poor. Therefore, in conjunction with reviewing the video, the OIG analyzed\nwitness statements and BOP records to beter determine what the video depicted.\n8 The official name for the document used to record an institutional count is “Bureau of Prisons Count Sheet.”\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2343o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023461.jpg": "Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations\nI. Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, <span class=\"highlight\">certified</span>, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023793.tif": "Electronic Discovery Authorization Form — MDC Brooklyn & MCC New York\nInmate Name & Register Number: | Federal Criminal Case No. & District:\nNumber of CDs/DVDs:; Requesting Atorney's Name, State Bar No. & Contact Information (Business Address,\nPhone No., Fax.

It is our hope\nthat in light of the recent developments in this case which we have set forth in our leter\nof June 5, 2oo6, our meetings, and herein, in particular the fact that there is no sex\nalleged, this case can be disposed of with, at most, an informal agreement, or more\nappropriately, no charges being filed at all.\nAs you knou, it was only at the June l, 2oo6 meeting, after eight months of\ninvestigation, that you and I both learned, for the very first time, and I believe to our\ncollective disbelief, that the allegation of the girl did not raise the slightest hint of actual\nsex. Up until that point, we had all been laboring under the assumption this girl had\nalleged multiple sexual encounters with my client. In fact, as you are aware, it was with\nthis in mind that we hired George Slatery, a highly respected polygraph expert, who\nunequivocally confirmed our client’s long held position both that there was no sex and\nthat the girl clearly stated she was l8 years old. Since, we nou knou with certainty that\nthere are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this\ngirl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not\nbring a “touching case\" — NO sex, NO charge — in fashioning an appropriate resolution to\nthis mater.\nAs we have discussed many times, the girl’s credibility is highly questionable and\nhas been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (l) repeatedly\nchanging her age on her web page (first l7, then l6, then l5) and posting graphic nude\nand suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,\nBa esene nnicensen nnenst Seumeralion Eovenue, South, Ons Clearlake Cosine, Saite l4oo; Wes Fala: Peach, Soo8\no7/26/l7 Telephone: 56l.659. 3Q), » Fapgimile: 56l.835.869l public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030472.jpg": "RICHARDSON & WEISS, P.A.

In fact, as you are aware, it was with\nthis in mind that we hired George Slatery, a highly respected polygraph expert, who\nunequivocally confirmed our client’s long held position both that there was no sex and\nthat the girl clearly stated she was l8 years old. Since, we nou knou with certainty that\nthere are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this\ngirl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not\nbring a \"touching case\" — NO sex, NO charge — in fashioning an appropriate resolution to\nthis mater.\nAs we have discussed many times, the girl’s credibility is highly questionable and\nhas been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (l) repeatedly\nchanging her age on her web page (first l7, then l6, then l5) and posting graphic nude\nand suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,\no7/26/l7 Telephone: 56l.659.8298 \"5 Baqsamile: 56l.835.869l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3o472\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00030525.jpg": "@l/ll/2oo6 l3:55 56l659o792.

The first trip was on September l4, 2oo9 when he traveled by\nhelicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach\nCounty by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only\nother passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by\nprobation. On August 27, 2oo9 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to\nSikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova\naccompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of\ntransportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights\ntaken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the\nhelicopter but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another\ndocument confirming the September l4, 2oo9 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. | am\nalso enclosing documents for the August 27, 2oo9 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.\nOn another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State\nAtorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of\nnis probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with\nprobation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. | note that many\nof the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scot Rothstein law\nOne Clearlake Centre, Suite l4oo 25o Australian Avenue South West Palm Beach, FL 334ol\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\np 56l.659.83oo 56l.835.869l www.agwpa.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33l57\n"};
