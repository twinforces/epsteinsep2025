The Third Circuit reached the same\nconclusion in United States v. Schneider, 8ol F.3d l86,\nl96 (8d Cir. 2ol5).\n\nThe Court sees no reason to depart from the\nreasoning in Weingarten. First, “[t]he Supreme Court's\nmodern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined\nto the post-conviction contexts of criminal sentencing\nand immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865\nF.3d at 58. To the extent that the categorical approach\nis ever appropriate in other contexts, it is in-\nappropriate here.\n\nThe Court begins with the statute’s text. Statutes\nthat call for application of the categorical approach\ntypically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior\ncriminal conviction. Id. at 59. “The language of § 32838,\nby contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That\nlinguistic <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> indicates Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether\n§ 3283 applied.” Jd. at 59-6o (alteration in original)\n(quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding\notherwise, but that case involved a venue statute\npresenting significantly different concerns. See United\nStates v. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4).\nThe Supreme Court has likewise held that a statute\nwhich uses the language “an offense that. . . involves\nfraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or\nvictims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a\ncircumstance-specific approach.” Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 US. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the\nword “involves” generally means that courts should\nlook to the circumstances of an offense as commited\nin each case.

The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v.

Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is irrelevant to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v. Diaz, l76 F.3d 52, 99 (2d Cir. l999) (co-conspirators\nin racketeering case continued to commit crimes without defendant after defendant’s\nincarceration).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002665.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l44 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l7 of 25\nby statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post facto,\nnevertheless would run afoul of ‘familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and\nsetled expectations.’”) Thus, in the criminal context, the second step of Landgraf should be read\nas providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as\nprohibiting retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting\n<span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even where\nthe charge is not time-barred at the time of the amendment.\n\nStatutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally to\nprotect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that are\nremote in time.” United States v.

That\nconcern is heightened here, where the government seeks to rely on the retroactive extension of a\ncriminal statute of limitations to prosecute a case based on conduct more than two decades old,\nwith litle, if any, evidence other than witness testimony. See Toussie, 397 U.S. at ll5\n(observing that statute of limitations “may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law\nenforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since the time of the\nalleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost or\ndestroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively\napplying the 2oo3 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional intent; it\nwould violate all notions of fundamental fairness.°\n> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay.\n\n° In Weingarten, the court stated that if the defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the trial court that the\n2oo3 Amendment could not retroactively extend the statute of limitations for live charges, the trial court’s holding\nwould have been in direct conflict with the Ninth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 92o\n(9th Cir. 2oo6). But in Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not yet reached age 25 as of the time of the\nindictment, and thus the charges would not have been time-barred under either version of § 3283. Thus, the court in\nLeo Sure Chief did not perform a Landgraf analysis.\n\nll\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2665", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002885.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l92 Filed o3/3l/2l Page 2 of 3\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we\ndo not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.\nId.\n\nBased on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July l2, 2o2l trial date and her\nlawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.\nIt was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government\nbelatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The\ntiming suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial\nmotions and government concern about the nou-apparent weakness of its case. The government\nmay be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and\nrelied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and\nMs. Maxwell’s prolonged detention.\n\nThis is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government. By adding\ncharges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally\ndestroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time alloted.

United States, l38 S. Ct.\n22o6, 22l3 (internal quotation marks and citation omited). “It has been clear for a generation that\n‘Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights . . .

Accordingly, a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights “are violated only when the\nchallenged conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy rather than that of a third party.”\nUnited States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 73l (l98o) (emphasis in original); see also United States\nv. Villegas, 899 F.2d l324, l333 (2d Cir. l99o). Ultimately, the Fourth Amendment inquiry is\n“whether [a] defendant has established a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched.”\nUnited States v. Chuang, 897 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir. l99o) (citations omited).

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that... . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3685", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 342 Filed lo/l3/2l Pagel5ofl7\nadmissions of bias on the part of jurors.* In-depth voir dire including limited open-ended\nquestions posed by counsel also helps to atack the minimization effect, whereby jurors often\nseek to decrease the extremity of their opinions in addition to their exposure to and the impact of\npretrial publicity.°\n\nC. The Court Can Reasonably Limit the Scope of Atorney-Conducted Voir Dire\n\nThe Court can also fairly and reasonably limit the time and scope of the atorney-\nconducted voir dire and prevent any abuse of the process. For example, the Court can direct\ndemand that the atorneys restrict themselves to new or proscribed areas of examination or\nrelevant follou-up examination to ferret out bias and prejudice. In addition, the Court can\nlegitimately place a specific time limit on atorney-conducted voir dire. Permiting each party\none minute per juror (expanded to three minutes if there is basis to pursue a cause challenge) is\neminently justifiable after basic voir dire has been conducted by the Court.

Statutes that call for application of the\ncategorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction.\nId. at 59. “The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal\nelements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That linguistic <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> indicates Congress\nintended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied.” Jd. at\n59-6o (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but\nthat case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States\nv. Morgan, 393 F.3d l92, 2oo (D.C. Cir. 2oo4). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a\nstatute which uses the language “an offense that. . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to\nthe victim or victims exceeds $lo,ooo” is “consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.”\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2oo9) (emphasis added). Thus, the word “involves”\ngenerally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as commited in each\ncase. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to\napply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 6o;\nSchneider, 8ol F.3d at l96.\n\nThe purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes\ndealing with prior convictions, “[t]he categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes: It\npromotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions\nin minitrials conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. l84, 2oo-ol (2ol3).\nIn the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the\nfirst instance whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct.” Weingarten,\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o77o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021120.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page73 of ll3\n\n2. The District Court’s application of § 3283 creates “impermissible\n\nretroactive effects” without authorization from Congress\n\nEven if the text and legislative history of § 3283 were unclear, Landgraf’s\n“presumption against statutory retroactivity” would foreclose retroactive operation\nof this statute at step two. 5ll U.S. at 293. Because “retroactive application\n[must] be avoided ‘absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result,’”\nwhich is lacking here, the District Court’s retroactive application of § 3283 must\nbe reversed. Enterprise, 39l F.3d at 4lo (quoting Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 28o).\n\nWere this Court to hold otherwise, it would stand in conflict with the Third\nCircuit. In U.S. v. Richardson, 5l2 F.2d lo5 (3d Cir. l975), the Third Circuit\nrejected the retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations, citing both a\ngeneral presumption against retroactivity similar to what the Supreme Court would\nlater echo in Landgraf, and the more specific canon in favor of repose articulated\nin Joussie. See Richardson, 5l2 F.2d at lo6.\n\nAlthough Richardson was decided before Landgraf, courts continue to\nfollou its holding that criminal statutes of limitations are presumed not to apply\nretroactively, even as to conduct that fell within the limitations period and could\nhave been prosecuted at the time of enactment. See U.S. v. Gentile, 235 F.Supp.3d\nat 655-56 (holding that <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> of securities fraud statute of limitations did not\napply retrospectively although the limitations period in his case had not yet expired\nwhen statute was expanded); U.S. v.

Morales v. Irizarry, 976\nF.Supp. 256, 258 (S.D.N.Y. l997) (citing Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 279) (“In the\nabsence of some such legislative indication, such a retroactive <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> of a\nsubstantive provision like the statute of limitations will not be presumed”).\nMorales was a civil case. But Landgraf’s “presumption against retroactive\nlegislation,” which “is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence,” 5ll U.S. at 265,\napplies with even stronger force in the criminal context. Unlike civil statutes,\n“criminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of respose.’”\nToussie, 397 U.S. at ll5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522). See U.S. v. Gentile,\n235 F.Supp.3d 649, 655 (D.N.J. 2ol7).

(Br.43). But as this Court has al-\nready recognized, Section 3283's text “reaches beyond\nthe offense and its legal elements to the conduct ‘in-\nvolv[ed]’ in the offense”—a “linguistic <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span>” that\nshous Congress’s intent for “courts to look beyond the\nbare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 ap-\nplied.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59-6o; see also Niyha-\nwan v.

Some cases involved statutes that defined a\n“crime of violence” as an offense that either “has as an\nelement” the use of physical force or “by its nature” in-\nvolves a substantial risk of force—language that in-\nvokes an elements-based approach.

Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious <span class=\"highlight\">expansion</span> and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI.

The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl.
