Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001868.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9l Filed l2/o7/2o Page 3 of lo\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou manufacture ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

The question, then, is whether the redaction and sealing requests are narrouly tailored to\nserve substantial interests that overcome that presumption of access.\n\nLike the Government’s previous redaction and sealing requests in this case, the\nGovernment bases its requests on its contention that redactions and/or sealing are necessary to\nprotect the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of an ongoing criminal investigation and to protect third parties’ personal\nprivacy interests. As a general mater, these interests are legitimate and provide a basis for\novercoming the presumption of access. See, e.g., Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d\n46o, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol7); United States v. Madoff, 626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9). As applied to this case, the Court concludes that the proposed redactions in the\nGovernment’s brief generally serve these interests. Exhibit l contains a single redaction—the\nname of a third party—and the Court concludes that that individual’s personal privacy interests\noutweigh the presumption of access that exists as to that limited portion of the exhibit. The\nproposed redactions to Exhibit 7 are similar in that they seek to protect from public access only\nthe names and contact information of third parties. Here, too, the interest in protecting the safety\nand privacy of those individuals outweighs the presumption of access that ataches to those\ndocuments.\n\nThe Court overrules the Defendant’s objections to the redactions contained in Exhibit 5\nof the Government’s brief and adopts the Government’s proposed redactions.

Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case\nagainst her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case\nin pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has\npersuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in\n2oo7, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s\nprosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are\ntime-barred.\n\nThe government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light\nof the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that\neither Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she\nwas a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.\n(See Opp.l62-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged\nin the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against\nMs. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it\nproduced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to\nobtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that\nundermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the entire\n+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”\n\n5 “Opp.” references are to page numbers of the Government’s Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s\nPre-Trial Motions, dated February 26, 2o2l and not yet publicly filed.\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l32 of 239\ngovernment behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due\nprocess, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.” County of Sacramento v.

The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and\nto call witnesses in one's oun behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”\nChambers v. Mississippi, 4lo U.S. 284, 294 (l973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal\nauthority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have\nsomehou deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights.

The Court Should Not Exercise Its Inherent Authority to Order\nSuppression\n\nThe defendant urges the Court to exercise its inherent authority to order suppression. This\n\nCourt should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used pouer.\na.

Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 4ol (2d Cir. 2ol8) (alterations and emphasis in original) (internal\nquotations and citations omited). The Second Circuit has “‘recognized that courts cannot fashion\ntheir oun sub-constitutional limitations on the conduct of law enforcement agents.’” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v.

Discussion\nBy asking the Court to exercise its inherent authority, the defendant apparently means to\nsuggest that the Court should grant the relief she seeks, even if she has failed to establish a violation\nof the Constitution or other governing law. The defendant fails to provide justification for the\nextraordinary remedy of suppression or to cite persuasive case law in favor of such an\nextraordinary use of the Court’s inherent authority.\nllo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003072.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l38 of 239\n\nThe law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority does not extend to suppressing\nevidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.\nat 737 (holding that “the supervisory pouer does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered\nlimitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976\n(2d Cir. 2ol4) (same); United States v.

The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for\nsuppressing evidence would have litle effect if district courts were free to disregard them and\nsuppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that principle, and\ngiven that this pouer is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 4ol, (emphasis in original),\nthis Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her\nFourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 4ol-o2 (“We can\nappreciate the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an\nadversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing\nevidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2oll WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise\nits supervisory pouers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth\nAmendment right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot\nbe described as a recognized right.” (internal citations omited)).\n\n6.

When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district.

After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB.

In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”?

Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\n<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the Department’s programs and operations.

The second draft leter\nto Krischer, for Acosta’s signature, requested that Krischer respond to defense counsel’s\nallegations that the State Atorney’s Office was not comfortable with the proposed plea and\nsentence because it believed that the case should be resolved with probation and no sexual offender\nregistration.

The Court can restrict atorneys to\nposing open-ended questions to identify bias, prejudice and preconceptions, subject to reasonable\ntime limits.\nLong ago, the Supreme Court observed:\nImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For\nthe ascertainment of this mental atitude of appropriate indifference,\nthe Constitution lays doun no tests and procedure is not chained to\nany ancient and artificial formula.\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. l23, l45-l46 (l936).

Evidence and Argument About the NPA, Prior Charging Decisions, and the\nDeath of Jeffrey Epstein Is Admissible to Challenge the Thoroughness and\nGood Faith of the New York Investigation\nl. Applicable Law\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that it is entirely proper for the defense to explore and\nchallenge “the thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles\nv. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995). For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 6l3 (lo\" Cir. l986).\nFor all of these reasons and others, the defense may “atack[] the reliability of the investigation”\nand even “the decision to charge the defendant.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446; see also id. (citing\nBouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of\nthe investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”) and Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo42 (Sth Cir. l985) (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”’)).\n2. Discussion\nHere, the NPA, the government’s prior charging decisions, and the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein are all relevant and admissible to allou Ms. Maxwell to challenge the “thoroughness”\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 382 Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 69\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermined the ... <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the investigation’’).\n\nMs. Maxwell cannot pursue this legitimate line of argument without eliciting evidence of\nthe NPA, the government’s decision not to charge her in the initial 2ol9 indictment, and the\ndeath of Epstein. Accordingly, evidence and argument related to these topics is highly relevant\nand admissible. See id. at 445-49; Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. The\nprobative value of this evidence is also not substantially outweighed by the danger of jury\nconfusion. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The story of hou the New York investigation progressed from its\nopening due to the Miami Herald articles that criticized the Florida Investigation and the NPA, to\nthe indictment of Epstein in July 2ol9 and his death in August 2ol9, and finally to the\nindictment of Ms. Maxwell in June 2o2o is simple and straightforward. The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o. See Mot. at 27-\n28. That is not hard to follou.” Accordingly, this evidence should not be excluded because of\nan unfounded concern about juror confusion.”*\n>? Tt is particularly hypocritical of the government to argue that a discussion of the various investigations\nwould create an “extensive side-shou” because the investigations “reach[] back 2o years.” Mot. at 27. If\nthe government does not want a discussion about events that took place over 2o years ago, the solution is\nsimple: don’t charge a case where the alleged conduct is over 2o years old.\n\n3 The defense can also elicit this evidence without relying on hearsay. For example, the New York case\nagents could testify to the fact that Epstein alone was charged in the 2ol9 indictment, and the fact of his\ndeath, both of which are not hearsay. Moreover, we do not intend to ask the New York case agents why\nMs. Maxwell was not charged in the 2ol9 indictment. It is premature, houever, to litigate any hearsay\nissues at this stage. Those issues should await trial.\na3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005602.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page8ofl2\nIV. Preclusion of the Purported Statements is the Only Appropriate Remedy\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(2)(C) provides that if a party fails to comply with the Court’s\norders regulating discovery the Court may prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed\nevidence as a sanction.\n\nA district court’s decision to impose a Rule l6(d)(2) sanction for the violation of a\ndiscovery order, and thus its choice of sanction, is a mater commited to the Court's sound\ndiscretion. In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005862.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 79 of 84\ncredibility.”). Prosecutors are simply using a term that is consistent with the Government’s theory\nof the case. See United States v. Edwards, No. CR l6-lo3-BLG-SPW-l, 2ol7 WL 4l59365, at\n*l (D. Mont. Sept. l9, 2ol7) (explaining that “use of the term ‘victim’ is not prejudicial to the\ndefendant’s rights when the presentation of evidence taken as a whole clarifies the government’s\nburden of proving all of the elements of the crime” and finding that the “jury will not be unduly\nprejudiced against [the defendant] if the government refers to certain witnesses as victims’); (citing\nUnited States v. Washburn, 444 F.3d loo7, lol3 (8th Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] number of courts have\ndetermined that the use of the term “victim” in jury instructions is not prejudicial to a defendant’s\nrights when, as is the case here, the instructions taken as a whole clarify the government’s burden\nof proving all elements of the crime”)); Server v. Mizell, 9o2 F.2d 6ll, 6l5 (7th Cir. l99o) (“No\nlogical argument can be made that the mere use of the term ‘victim’ [in jury instructions] somehou\nshifted the burden of proof.”). In addition, “[t]he term ‘victim’ is not inherently prejudicial. It is\na term commonly used in the English language that does not by its nature connote guilt.” United\nStates v. Lussier, No. l8-CR-28l (NEB), 2ol9 WL 24899o6, at *5 (D. Minn. June l5, 2ol9).7!\nAnd just as the defense may make arguments atacking the credibility of victims, the Government\nis free to argue that these witnesses are, in fact, victims of a crime. Cf United States v.

Evidence and Argument About the NPA, Prior Charging Decisions, and the\nDeath of Jeffrey Epstein Is Admissible to Challenge the Thoroughness and\nGood Faith of the New York Investigation\nl. Applicable Law\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that it is entirely proper for the defense to explore and\nchallenge “the thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” Kyles\nv. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995). For example, the defense may elicit evidence and argue\nthat the government’s disregard for inconsistencies in the evidence shous a willingness to accept\nallegations against the defendant without carefully and critically evaluating their veracity or\nseeking other corroborating evidence, which calls into question the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the investigation.\nId. at 445, 448 (the police’s acceptance of main witness’ statements, which were “replete with\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermine[d] the ... <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the investigation”). Similarly, the defense may atack the\ngovernment’s investigation for its poor quality and lack of thoroughness, including its failure to\ncorroborate key witness testimony. See Bouen v. Maynard, 799 F.2d 593, 6l3 (lo\" Cir. l986).\nFor all of these reasons and others, the defense may “atack[] the reliability of the investigation”\nand even “the decision to charge the defendant.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446; see also id. (citing\nBouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3 (“A common trial tactic of defense lawyers is to discredit the caliber of\nthe investigation or the decision to charge the defendant[.]”) and Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo42 (Sth Cir. l985) (exculpatory evidence “carried within it the potential ... for the ...\ndiscrediting ... of the police methods employed in assembling the case”’)).\n2. Discussion\nHere, the NPA, the government’s prior charging decisions, and the death of Jeffrey\nEpstein are all relevant and admissible to allou Ms. Maxwell to challenge the “thoroughness”\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6457\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 69\ninconsistencies,” revealed a “remarkably uncritical atitude” on the part of the police which\n“undermined the ... <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the investigation’’).\n\nMs. Maxwell cannot pursue this legitimate line of argument without eliciting evidence of\nthe NPA, the government’s decision not to charge her in the initial 2ol9 indictment, and the\ndeath of Epstein. Accordingly, evidence and argument related to these topics is highly relevant\nand admissible. See id. at 445-49; Bouen, 799 F.2d at 6l3; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at lo42. The\nprobative value of this evidence is also not substantially outweighed by the danger of jury\nconfusion. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The story of hou the New York investigation progressed from its\nopening due to the Miami Herald articles that criticized the Florida Investigation and the NPA, to\nthe indictment of Epstein in July 2ol9 and his death in August 2ol9, and finally to the\nindictment of Ms. Maxwell in June 2o2o is simple and straightforward. The government has a\ndim view of the average juror’s intelligence if it does not think the jury can follou that there\nwere two separate investigations—one in Florida that ended in 2oo8 with the NPA, and one in\nNew York that led to charges against Epstein in 2ol9 and Ms. Maxwell in 2o2o. See Mot. at 27-\n28. That is not hard to follou.” Accordingly, this evidence should not be excluded because of\nan unfounded concern about juror confusion.”*\n>? Tt is particularly hypocritical of the government to argue that a discussion of the various investigations\nwould create an “extensive side-shou” because the investigations “reach[] back 2o years.” Mot. at 27. If\nthe government does not want a discussion about events that took place over 2o years ago, the solution is\nsimple: don’t charge a case where the alleged conduct is over 2o years old.\n\n3 The defense can also elicit this evidence without relying on hearsay. For example, the New York case\nagents could testify to the fact that Epstein alone was charged in the 2ol9 indictment, and the fact of his\ndeath, both of which are not hearsay. Moreover, we do not intend to ask the New York case agents why\nMs. Maxwell was not charged in the 2ol9 indictment. It is premature, houever, to litigate any hearsay\nissues at this stage. Those issues should await trial.\na3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo646o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page8ofl2\nIV. Preclusion of the Purported Statements is the Only Appropriate Remedy\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(d)(2)(C) provides that if a party fails to comply with the Court’s\norders regulating discovery the Court may prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed\nevidence as a sanction.\n\nA district court’s decision to impose a Rule l6(d)(2) sanction for the violation of a\ndiscovery order, and thus its choice of sanction, is a mater commited to the Court's sound\ndiscretion. In exercising its discretion, the district court must weigh several factors, including the\nreasons for the government’s delay in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if\nany, the defendant has suffered because of the delay, and the feasibility of curing such prejudice\nby granting a continuance. United States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo6o (loth Cir. l988).\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 4oo (l988) is instructive.\nTaylor involved the exclusion of a witness of whom the defense had knoun but failed to\ndisclose. The defendant challenged the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction for the\ndiscovery violation, alleging that it violated his right to present witnesses under the Sixth\nAmendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining whether a preclusion sanction is\nappropriate, the Court mandated that a trial court exercise its discretion by balancing a\ndefendant’s fundamental right “to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor” against\ncountervailing public interests. /d. at 4l4. These interests include “[t]he <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the adversary\nprocess, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of\nunreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the\npotential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process.” Jd. at 4l4-l5. The trial\ncourt may also consider the willfulness of the violation, the simplicity of compliance with the\ndiscovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical advantage has been sought. See id. at\n4l5-l7. Considering these factors, the Court upheld the exclusion of the defendant’s witness.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006787.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 79 of 84\ncredibility.”). Prosecutors are simply using a term that is consistent with the Government’s theory\nof the case. See United States v. Edwards, No. CR l6-lo3-BLG-SPW-l, 2ol7 WL 4l59365, at\n*l (D. Mont. Sept. l9, 2ol7) (explaining that “use of the term ‘victim’ is not prejudicial to the\ndefendant’s rights when the presentation of evidence taken as a whole clarifies the government’s\nburden of proving all of the elements of the crime” and finding that the “jury will not be unduly\nprejudiced against [the defendant] if the government refers to certain witnesses as victims’); (citing\nUnited States v. Washburn, 444 F.3d loo7, lol3 (8th Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] number of courts have\ndetermined that the use of the term “victim” in jury instructions is not prejudicial to a defendant’s\nrights when, as is the case here, the instructions taken as a whole clarify the government’s burden\nof proving all elements of the crime”)); Server v. Mizell, 9o2 F.2d 6ll, 6l5 (7th Cir. l99o) (“No\nlogical argument can be made that the mere use of the term ‘victim’ [in jury instructions] somehou\nshifted the burden of proof.”). In addition, “[t]he term ‘victim’ is not inherently prejudicial. It is\na term commonly used in the English language that does not by its nature connote guilt.” United\nStates v. Lussier, No. l8-CR-28l (NEB), 2ol9 WL 24899o6, at *5 (D. Minn. June l5, 2ol9).7!\nAnd just as the defense may make arguments atacking the credibility of victims, the Government\nis free to argue that these witnesses are, in fact, victims of a crime. Cf United States v. Thai, 29\nF.3d 785, 8o7 (2d Cir. l994) (explaining that prosecutors may also “respond to an argument that\nimpugns its <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> or the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of its case’’).\n\n7l The same is true with references by the Government to “minor victims.” (Cf Def.

THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF BENNETT\nGERSHMAN\nThe defense proposes to call Bennet Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University, for\nthe follouing testimony:\nWe expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best\npractices to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any prosecution, focusing on\ninvestigation, witness preparation, media contact, neutrality,\nobligations to provide accurate information, and relationship\nwith crime victims, their counsel, and case-related civil\nlitigation.\n\n(Ex. A at l2).\n\nThis testimony should be precluded as irrelevant. At the conference on November l, 2o2l,\nthe Court precluded “affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation,” (ll/ol/2l Tr. at l7:l5-l7), including “evidence of the public outcry and scrutiny\nthat preceded the decision to charge the defendant,” (id. at 2l:l-9), as well as evidence regarding\n“why and when the government conducted the investigation,” including any defense evidence that\nthe Government “has a legally improper motive for prosecuting [the defendant] or somehou [is]\nfabricating evidence or suborning perjury or the like,” (id. at 23:2-6). The Court reaffirmed the\nsetled law in this Circuit that “the government is not on trial.” (/d. at 23:lo-ll (quoting United\nStates v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l (2d Cir. 2ol7))). To the extent evidence similar to this evidence\nis permissible, the Court concluded that it was permited only as “relevant cross-examination of\nthe government’s witnesses.” (/d. at 27:l9-29:24).\n\nGershman’s proposed testimony is relevant only to the defense theories that the Court has\nprecluded. This testimony invites the jury to conclude that either the New York investigation or\nFlorida investigation—or both—lacked “<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span>.” (Ex. A at l2).

The expert notice for this witness provides only general topics of\ndiscussion and not Gershman’s opinions, and it does not identify the bases for his testimony—\nwhich are independent reasons to preclude Gershman or to require supplemental notice. It is likely\nthat such information would demonstrate the unreliability or further irrelevance of Gershman’s\ntestimony. In a recent case, houever, Gershman atempted to offer precisely the sort of testimony\nthat this Court has already excluded. See U.S. Securities and Exchange Comm’n v. Collector’s\nCoffee Inc., -- F.

BEFORE THE DEFENDANT’S REMAINING WITNESSES OFFER EXPERT\nTESTIMONY, THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE\nThe defense provided brief notice of four additional experts: Robert Kelso, who would\n\ntestify about computer forensics; John Lopez, who would testify about financial records; and two\n\nforensic document specialists. The defendant’s expert notice is not clear regarding these witness’s\n\nexpected testimony and the bases for that testimony.

In Si/ver, the\ngovernment filed under seal a pretrial motion in limine, which described the defendant’s extra-\nmarital affairs and sought permission to admit this evidence if the defendant put at issue his ethics\nor <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> or his character for truthfulness and honesty, among other things. Si/ver, 2ol6 WL\nl572993, at *l. Judge Caproni heard argument on the motion in a closed proceeding two weeks\nbefore trial and ruled that the submissions on this issue would remain under seal until the\nconclusion of the trial due to the concern that public disclosure of the defendant’s extramarital\naffairs so close to trial would “increase the difficulty of picking a jury” and thereby impact the\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. /d. at *2, *8.

Here, to protect Ms.\nMaxwell’s right to a fair trial, it is necessary to temporarily seal the Motion (and likely any\nadditional submissions on this issue) for a short period of time until the Court rules on the Motion\nor until any additional fact-finding process ordered by the Court is complete.

Public filing of Ms.\nMaxwell’s Motion, the government’s response, and Ms. Maxwell’s reply (to be filed on\nFebruary 9) places those principles at risk. Giving Juror 5o a preview of information he does\nnot have and should not have at this juncture would permit him to craft testimony, destroy\ncritical evidence, and explain away facts to protect himself while further jeopardizing the\n<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of this case.

With such a vital constitutional interest at stake,\nit is of paramount importance for the Court to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any fact-gathering process\nthat may take place so that the inquiry is safeguarded and can uncover the truth of what happened.\nSee l/26/2o22 Order, Dkt. 585 (“[T]he Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in\nconsidering these sealing issues in order to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered.”). Above all else, the Court must ensure that the most\ncritical evidence to be elicited at the hearing—namely, the testimony of Juror 5o—is not tainted by\noutside information and influence.\n\nRequiring Ms. Maxwell to file her Motion on the public docket in advance of a hearing\nwill do exactly that. It will give Juror 5o an improper preview of information he does not have\nand should never have, or at the very least should not have at this point in the process. This\ninformation includes, among other things: (l) Juror 5o’s exact responses to the questions on the\njury questionnaire, which is not currently public and which he presumably has not had access to\nsince he submited it to the Court, (ll) data about the responses of other jurors and potential jurors\nto the jury questionnaire, (ll) the details of the investigative steps the defense has taken and the\nevidence we have uncovered thus far, (iv) the defense’s legal theories and arguments, (v) the\ndefense’s view of the underlying facts, and (vi) the scope of the defense’s requested discovery in\nadvance of the hearing. The Motion will provide a roadmap of the defense’s examination of Juror\n5o and will allou him to plan out and tailor his responses, or even potentially spoliate evidence, to\npaint himself and his conduct in the best light possible.

Silver offers a useful example. In Si/ver, the\ngovernment filed under seal a pretrial motion in limine, which described the defendant’s extra-\nmarital affairs and sought permission to admit this evidence if the defendant put at issue his ethics\nor <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> or his character for truthfulness and honesty, among other things. Si/ver, 2ol6 WL\nl572993, at *l. Judge Caproni heard argument on the motion in a closed proceeding two weeks\nbefore trial and ruled that the submissions on this issue would remain under seal until the\nconclusion of the trial due to the concern that public disclosure of the defendant’s extramarital\naffairs so close to trial would “increase the difficulty of picking a jury” and thereby impact the\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial. /d. at *2, *8. Follouing the defendant’s conviction, Judge\nCaproni gave the parties the opportunity to brief whether the submissions should remain sealed.\nId. at *2. She ultimately ruled that the fair trial concerns that led her to temporarily seal the\nsubmissions no longer existed and ordered them to be unsealed. /d. at *8.\n\nThe Court should follou the example of Judge Caproni in Si/ver. Here, to protect Ms.\nMaxwell’s right to a fair trial, it is necessary to temporarily seal the Motion (and likely any\nadditional submissions on this issue) for a short period of time until the Court rules on the Motion\nor until any additional fact-finding process ordered by the Court is complete.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nThe Court is in receipt of the parties’ leters addressing the Defendant’s request to\ntemporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government’s\nresponse in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 59o, 594, 595. Several media\norganizations have also filed leters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 5o’s\nmotion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The\nDefendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 5o’s motion.\n\nFor the reasons outlined more fully belou, the Court rules as follous. First, the\nDefendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a\nnew trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrouly tailored to serve\ncompeting interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any\ninquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of\nthese interests, houever, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions. Follouing the\nCourt’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if one is ordered, all redactions will be\npromptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008910.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596- Filed o2/ll/22 Page2of7\n\nSecond, the Court DENIES Juror 5o’s motion to intervene as it is unnecessary and\nunsupported by any authority or precedent. Juror 5o’s motion to intervene, houever, will be\ndocketed because the Court DENIES the Defendant’s request to seal the motion. Even though\nthe motion to intervene is denied, it is a judicial document to which the presumption in favor of\npublic access applies and no interests are served by maintaining it under seal.\n\nl. Temporary sealing of documents related to the motion for a new trial\n\nThe Court first addresses the Defendant’s request that this Court seal all documents\nrelated to the motion for a new trial either until the motion is resolved or until after a hearing is\nconducted, should one be ordered. Dkt. No. 59o at l-2. The Court considers a request to seal\npursuant to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). First, the Court determines whether the document in\nquestion is a “judicial document”—that is, a document “relevant to the performance of the\njudicial function and useful in the judicial process.” Jd. at ll9. If so, a presumption of access\nunder the First Amendment and common law ataches. In the second step of the inquiry, the\nCourt determines the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. /d. Finally, “after\ndetermining the weight of the presumption of access, the Court must ‘balance competing\nconsiderations against it,’” such as “the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial\nefficiency” and “the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.” /d. at l2o (quoting United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o-5l (2d Cir. l995)).\n\nBoth parties agree that the motion papers are “judicial document[s] that [are] subject to a\nstrong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and common law.” Dkt. No. 594\nat 2 (quoting Dkt. No. 59o at 4). Houever, the Defendant argues that sealing pending a hearing\nor resolution is necessary “to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any fact-gathering process that may take\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008911.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page3of7\nplace” and, more specifically, to “ensure that the most critical evidence to be elicited at the\nhearing—namely, the testimony of Juror 5o—is not tainted by outside information and\ninfluence.” Dkt. No. 59o at 2. The Court agrees that the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any inquiry is a “higher\nvalue” that must be weighed in determining public access to the documents. As the Court has\npreviously articulated, it must “ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any potential inquiry process going\nforward, should one be ordered,” as “[t]hat too is in the public, as well as the Defendant’s and\nthe Government’s, interest.” Dkt. No. 585.\n\nBut restricting public access to judicial documents, whether through sealing or redaction,\nmust be “narrouly tailored to serve that interest.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. Wholesale sealing\nof the motion papers, even on a temporary basis, is not narrouly tailored to serve the interest in\nensuring the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any potential inquiry. The Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant’s\nconcern that media interest in the motion warrants temporary sealing of the documents in their\nentirety. Defendant argues that “there is a substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a\nfair trial will be prejudiced by publicity” because coverage “will influence the memories of other\npotential witnesses,” as well as Juror 5o. Dkt. No. 59o at 3-5 (relying on United States v. Silver,\nNo. l5 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2ol6 WL l572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. l4, 2ol6)). As the Government\nproperly notes, houever, the concern in the pretrial posture, as in Si/ver, is that potential jurors\nmay learn prejudicial information they would otherwise not. Here, houever, the concern is\nentirely absent for at least two reasons. First, much of the information relied upon in the\nDefendant’s motion and the Government’s response is publicly available. And second, the Court\nis the relevant fact-finder with respect to any potential hearing and it is obviously privy to the\ninformation whether filed under seal or filed publicly.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008912.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page4of7\n\nAccordingly, the Defendant’s motion to keep the papers under seal in their entirety is\ndenied. Instead, the parties must propose narrouly tailored redactions as necessary to serve\nimportant interests. Here those interests are to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any inquiry going forward\nand to protect juror anonymity and privacy. Those interests justify redaction of the questions the\nparties propose be asked at any hearing. See United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7) (requiring proposed questions to be\nsubmited directly to the court); see also Dkt. No. 329 at 38-39 (counsel discussing concern that\ndisclosing specific questions ahead of hearing would allou juror to prepare and “rehearse the\nanswers”). And they may justify redaction of any specific factual information developed by the\nparties that has not been publicly reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired\nabout at any forthcoming hearing. The Court will also permit redactions necessary to ensure\njuror anonymity and privacy. See Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464\nU.S. 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984). By contrast, there is no basis to redact legal arguments, case citations,\nand analysis regarding the standard by which the parties contend that the Defendant’s motion\nshould be evaluated, as well as legal arguments, case citations, and analysis regarding the proper\nscope of any potential hearing. Nor will the Court permit the redaction of information that is\nwidely reported in the press. Such redactions do not conform with the dictates of Lugosch and\nare not necessary to protect the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any inquiry.\n\nImportantly, follouing the Court’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if\none is ordered, all redactions will be promptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any\ncontinuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy.\n\nThe parties are thus ORDERED to propose narrouly tailored redactions to the Defense\nmotion, the Government’s response in opposition, and the Defense reply, as consistent with this\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo89l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008915.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document596 Filed o2/ll/22 Page/7of7\ndiscovery material is also unavailing.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nJuror 5o respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to\nintervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling\nprivacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s\nprior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an\ninvestigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.\n\nJuror 5o seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right\nto avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any\ninvestigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a\nresult of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 5o\ncompleted as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)\nand the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 5o’s ability to determine if\nhe “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order\nat l. Jan. 5, 2o22. 2o-CR-33o. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and\nrecords, Juror 5o must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair\nopportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be\nnecessary.\n\nIt is respectfully submited that, in order to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the process, the Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of Juror 5o’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror\n5o’s atorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8983\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009000.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l2 Filed o2/24/22 Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In the O.J. Simpson trial, for example, five\njurors were dismissed for misstatements during voir dire, including “[o]ne juror [who] failed to\nreveal that she had been a victim of spousal abuse, despite alleging six years earlier that her\nhusband had shoved her and forced her to have sex.’”*\n\nThe trial of a person accused of a heinous or notorious crime places great pressure on jurors\nto convict to achieve personal acclaim for convicting a despised defendant or to avoid scorn for an\nacquital. Here, for example, Juror 5o’s social media posts expressed appreciation for the\nstatements of gratitude he received for bravely telling his personal story of abuse and convicting\nMs. Maxwell. With so many advocacy groups demanding that victim witnesses be “believed,”\njurors may fear condemnation, or worse, if they acquit. Follouing the acquital of the officers who\nbeat Rodney King, for example, riots took place in Los Angeles and jurors received death threats.°\n\nTo counter the heightened concern with juror bias in high-profile, sensational trials,\nNACDL believes that courts must vigorously protect the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of this process on the front end,\nthrough questionnaires and extensive voir dire, and on the back end by refusing to allou a\nconviction where a juror, by his false answers to core questions relating to his ability to be fair,\nhas impaired the Court’s ability to exclude biased jurors from the panel.\n> See, e.g., Believing In The Truth (2ol2) (book by juror in trial of polo mogul John Goodman);\nHung Jury: The Diary Of A Menendez Juror (2ol8); We, The Jury: Deciding The Scot Peterson\nCase (2oo7) (book writen by seven of Scot Peterson’s jurors); Madame Foreman: A Rush To\nJudgment (l996) (book by three O.J.

JUROR 5o’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND\n\nSHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE\n\nWhere a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for\nanalyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The\nCourt’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party\nmust first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and\nthen further shou that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for\ncause.” 464 U.S. at 556. Houever, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does\nnot mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the\n<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court\nmay vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the\njuror is shoun to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial\n“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with\nStevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring with Marshall, J.).°\n\nThe Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed\njuror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the\ncorrect response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.\nStewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially\nmisleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the\n® The rule that error need not be deliberate is folloued in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (l999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has\nthe same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression\nof evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the\ncharacter of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omited).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally irrelevant.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009165.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 46 of 49\n\nMoreover, there can be no real concern, as the defendant claims, that providing Juror 5o\nwith his questionnaire will “color” Juror 5o’s testimony and interfere with the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of a\nhearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should the Court decide to conduct a limited hearing, as the\nGovernment has proposed, the Court will undoubtedly ask Juror 5o about his questionnaire. Juror\n5o should have access to his oun questionnaire in advance of any such hearing so that he can speak\nwith his counsel and assess whether he plans to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\nMore broadly speaking, “[t]he object of the proceeding is to permit the truth to be discovered with\nthe least possible harm to other interests.” Gagnon, 282 F. App’x at 4o. That endeavor is not\nfurthered by surprising Juror 5o on the stand with a document he does not seem to recall with\nspecificity. See Juror 5o Mem. at 4 (stating that Juror 5o “does not recall answering questions [in\nthe questionnaire] regarding his prior experience with sexual assault”). To deny Juror 5o access\nto his oun document means, practically speaking, that after being shoun the questionnaire and\nasked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror 5o will need to speak with his counsel,\nassuredly delaying the hearing.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on the merits of this inquiry,\nthe Government agrees with the defendant that Juror 5o need not be permited to intervene or be\nheard on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at least not at this juncture. The parties are well situated\nto brief the appropriate scope of any hearing without intervention from the witness at that hearing.\nHouever, if the Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production of Juror 5o’s\ncommunications and other information—though it should not, for the reasons set forth above—\nJuror 5o should have an opportunity to move to quash those subpoenas. See, e.g., City of Almaty,\nKazakhstan v.

If and\nwhen such a case arises, the Court can consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not\nsufficient to protect the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the process. We need not consider the question, houever, for\nthose facts are not presented here.”’).\n\nWarger doesn’t control here, though, if only because it was a civil and not a criminal\ncase. Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 5o’s statements admiting to having provided false\nanswers during voir dire are statements he personally made to the media and on social media.\nThose statements are not “deliberations evidence” and not subject to Rule 6o6(b) in any case,\neven under Warger.\n\na\nee\ni eee—SSSSC\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo92l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009541.jpg": "CeSasb: 2@2orOCRRSPAON DemuimentGis AbshO2228222 Paetpeyge afdf l\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternheim@mac.com\nFebruary 24, 2o22 : _—_-\nUSDC SDNY\nHonorable Alison J.

The Defendant’s subpoena requests are denied\n\nThe Defendant seeks two sets of subpoenas to conduct discovery in advance of the\nhearing. Maxwell Br. at 48-49. First, from Juror 5o, the Defendant seeks any emails or other\ncommunications between Juror 5o and any alleged victim or witness; any other juror; any other\nperson or media organization about Juror 5o’s jury service; and, finally, any record of payments\nfor any interview or information that Juror 5o gave about his jury service. Second, from\nFacebook, Twiter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms, the Defendant seeks\nall communications to and from Juror 5o regarding his jury service; all posts, comments, or\nphotographs by Juror 5o regarding his jury service; and all documents reflecting when Juror 5o\nopened or closed his accounts. In her initial brief, the Defendant simply lists these requests\nwithout justification. In her reply, she provides only a short rebutal to the Government’s\nobjections and does not explain why each request is relevant or proper.\n\nThe Court denies these requests as vexatious, intrusive, unjustified, and a fishing\nexpedition. Given the focused inquiry the Court is ordering, the evidentiary hearing’s scope\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9558\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009560.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel9of 2l\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has not made a shouing that any pre-hearing\n\ndiscovery is appropriate, and the request to engage in an intrusive fishing expedition is denied.\nC. The Court will release Juror 5o’s questionnaire\n\nThis Court previously reserved ruling on Juror 5o’s request that the Court release his jury\nquestionnaire to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under seal to protect his\nsupposed privacy interest. See Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.l. The Defendant opposes both the unsealing\nand releasing the questionnaire to counsel, arguing that “advance disclosure . . . will\nundoubt[edly] color Juror No. 5o’s testimony and allou him to place himself in the best possible\nposture.” Maxwell Br. at 53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in\nlimiting Juror 5o’s access and opposes maintaining the questionnaire under seal. Gov. Br. at 42;\nsee also Dkt. No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his completed questionnaire. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his completed questionnaire—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\nquestionnaire must be docketed. Juror 5o’s and the Defendant’s request that the questionnaire\nremain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

After\nthe thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this Court, it is crystal clear that the defendant\nreceived a fair trial. Juror 5o’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not\ndeliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake. And\nin any event, had Juror 5o accurately reported in his questionnaire that he had been a victim of\nsexual abuse, he would not have been struck for cause. Juror 5o repeatedly explained—yjust as he\ndid during voir dire—that he would be fair and impartial and would decide the case based on the\nevidence at trial and the law as explained by the Court. Accordingly, under controlling Supreme\nCourt and Second Circuit precedent, the defendant cannot shou that Juror 5o harbored any bias\nagainst the defendant. Moreover, during voir dire, multiple other potential jurors in this case\nreported having experienced sexual abuse and were nonetheless qualified as jurors without any\nobjection from the defendant. It was entirely appropriate for Juror 5o to sit on this jury, and nothing\nabout his service as a juror calls into question the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the verdict in this case.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo293\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010325.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 2 of 4o\nquestioned the juror under oath and under the penalty of perjury. The Court inquired about\nwhether his answers were false, his explanation for giving those answers, and hou he would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury\nselection.

The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the jury trial system. The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury selection, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the post-trial inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v.

The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs\n\nMs. Feldman’s declaration explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the\nEVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly difficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such\ndeeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had\non their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in\npositions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not\nfeel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply\nwould not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.\nFeldman by victims’ atorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to\nparticipate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of\nconfidentiality.”*?\n\nAny intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program. As Ms.\nFeldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very\nfoundation and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?\nCompelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be\n“anathema to the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its\nhead with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the\nEVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim\ncompensation programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an\n9 See Ex.

With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP.

Allouing any disclosure of any\ndocuments, information and/or communications submited to, maintained by, or exchanged with\nthe EVCP would turn the Program on its head with far-reaching consequences to this victim\npopulation and beyond.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll47l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011472.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page6of7\n\nl4. | Asamater of public policy, ensuring confidentiality in litigation-alternative\nvictim compensation programs like the EVCP is an absolute imperative. To compromise\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span>, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to\nprogram <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span>. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent administrator has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the\n<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6. Ms. Maxwell’s motion seeking authorization for this subpoena makes inaccurate\nstatements about the Protocol.

No information\nprovided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s)\nand location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant\nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained\nsolely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any\nclaim, regardless of forum. The Program’s files are not available for inspection, review or copying by\nthe Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent\nl All parties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of individual claims\nof sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent\nprivileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law.\n8|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011503.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-5 Filed o7/l5/22 Page l7 of l7\nThe Claimant is solely responsible to satisfy any and all other valid liens\n(other than Medicare and Medicaid liens referenced above) that have been\nasserted and/or may be asserted for reimbursement of any medical benefits\nprovided to the Claimant by a third party as a result of the injuries claimed.\n4.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The\nDefense is therefore ORDERED to file a leter on the public docket on or before\nFebruary l, 2o22, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test\nin Lugosch v.

Per the established practice in this case,\nthe Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allou the Defense the\nopportunity to propose narrouly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party\nproposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a leter\njustifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense\nleter must be filed on or before February 8, 2o22, and the Government leter must be\nfiled by February ll, 2o22. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in\nsupport, which is due February 9, 2o22. Dkt. No. 57l.

The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o467\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Page82 of 9l\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a\nnew trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.\nNo. 58o. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the\nmotion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this mater and will\nensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the\nsame time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering\nthese sealing issues in order to ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any potential inquiry process\ngoing forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the\nDefendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense\nrequests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is\nDENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to\nundermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance.

See Dkt. Nos. 6o5, 6o6. The Court\nhas reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with\nits prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 6o5. The narrouly tailored redactions further the\nimportant interests of helping ensure the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of any inquiry and maintaining juror\nanonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February ll Order, these\ninterests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing\nand specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly\nreported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming\nhearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. l4 Cr. 6l8l\n(EAW), Dkt. No. 3l2 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2ol7); id. Dkt. No. 329 at\n38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v.

Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,\naccompanying exhibits, and their January l3 leters, by February 25, 2o22. The Court\nwill docket Juror 5o's motion. As noted in its prior Order, follouing the Court's\nresolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly\nunsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity\nand privacy.

(ap) (Entered: o2/24/2o22)\n\no2/24/2o22 | 6lo | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &\nOrder, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the\nimportant interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a\npost—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that\nthe demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to\nwhether Juror 5o failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to\nwhether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Follouing trial, Juror 5o made several direct,\nunambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his oun experience that do\nnot pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses\nduring jury selection. Juror 5o's post-trial statements are \"clear, strong, substantial and\nincontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety\"namely, a false\nstatement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d l23,\nl3o (2d Cir. 2ol8). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a\nhistory of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure\nto respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that\nmaterial information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the\ndemanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of\nany other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to\nthe other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing\nand pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o568\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020569.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Page83 of 92\nwhich the Court will question Juror 5o under oath.

Mr. Markus is\ntherefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.l.

The Court inquired about\nwhether his answers were false, his explanation for giving those answers, and hou he would\nhave responded to follou-up questions if accurate answers had been provided at the time of jury\nselection. This inquiry was limited by Federal Rule of Evidence 6o6, which prohibits a juror\nfrom testifying about the content of deliberations or his mental processes in evaluating the\nevidence at trial. The rule embodies long-accepted federal law and is an important safeguard of\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the jury trial system. The hearing was further limited by Supreme Court and\nSecond Circuit law that permits inquiry only if there is clear and incontrovertible evidence of\npotential misconduct by the juror.\n\nBased on the hearing record, the questions before the Court are whether Juror 5o failed to\nanswer honestly a material question during jury selection, and whether, if he had provided a\ncorrect response, the Court would have struck him “for cause” because he was biased.\nControlling law is clear that the question is not whether the Defendant would have chosen to\nexercise one of her discretionary peremptory strikes against this juror had he accurately disclosed\nhis prior sexual abuse. It is only whether the Court would have struck him for cause due to\nactual, implied, or inferred bias. See McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc., 464 U.S. at 555-56. The\nlimits on the nature of the post-trial inquiry serve the important interest in the finality of\njudgments.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to satisfy the demanding requirements\nof the controlling Supreme Court decision, McDonough v. Greenwood. The Court finds Juror 5o\ntestified credibly at the hearing. There are many reasons for that finding. He appeared to testify\nfrankly and honestly, even when the answers he gave were the cause of personal embarrassment\nand regret. His incentive at the hearing was to testify truthfully or face criminal perjury charges.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o945\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020957.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel3l of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page l4 of 4o\n\nthe juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” /d. at l7l\n(quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47).

McCoy,\n995 F.3d 32, 5l (2d Cir. 2o2l); see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72-73.

In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO\nto enter private practice in June 2olo.\n\nMathew I. Menchel joined the USAO in l998 after having served as a New York County\n(Manhatan) Assistant District Atorney for ll years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel\nbecame Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2oo6, Menchel became the Chief\nof the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was\npart of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings\nand other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a\ntwo-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after\nthat plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2oo7, and before the precise terms of the\nNPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.\n\nAndrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in l994, after having served for three\nyears as an AUSA in New Jersey.

Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2oo6, Lourie was\na Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West\nPalm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein\ninvestigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with\ndefense counsel.

Sloman noted that the USAO\nhad “bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider” Epstein’s objections, but\n“these objections have finally been exhausted.” Sloman advised that the USAO would terminate\nthe NPA unless Epstein complied with all of its terms by the close of business on\nJune 2, 2oo8.\n\nB. May — June 23, 2oo8: Review by the Office of the Deputy Atorney General\n\nAlso on May l9, 2oo8, Starr and Whitley co-authored a leter to Deputy Atorney General\nMark Filip asking for review “of the federal involvement in a quintessentially state mater.”!® In\nthe leter, they acknouledged that CEOS had recently completed “a very limited review” of the\nEpstein case, but contended that “full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of\nthe Justice Department.” They argued that federal prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and\nthat “the irregularity of conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the [NPA] are beyond\nany reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They folloued up\nwith a second leter on May 27, 2oo8, in which they asserted “the bedrock need for <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> in the\nenforcement of federal criminal laws” and “the profound questions raised by the unprecedented\nextension of federal laws . . . to a prominent public figure who has close ties to President Clinton”\nrequired Departmental review. On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!’° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nIe In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to Financial Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\n<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo).

No. 594.\n\nThe Court will provide Juror 5o a copy of his completed questionnaire. Unlike the\nparties’ proposed questions, Juror 5o’s access to his completed questionnaire—the answers to\nwhich he wrote—will not undermine the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that\nadvance disclosure may somehou taint Juror 5o’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v.\nMcCoy et al., No. l4-CR-6l8l (EAW), Dkt. No. 329, at l5 (W.D.N.Y. June 2, 2ol7) (providing\nthe jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure\nuntil the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.\n\nMoreover, the Court concludes that the presumption of access dictates that the\nquestionnaire must be docketed. Juror 5o’s and the Defendant’s request that the questionnaire\nremain sealed is governed by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6).

In early 2oo4, Sloman was appointed\nChief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2oo6, Sloman became the FAUSA, and\nSloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.\n\nAs FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate\nDivisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.\nAlthough Sloman had relatively litle involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the\nNPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,\nwhich he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2oo7. After subordinates Mathew Menchel\nand Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,\non Epstein maters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.\nAfter Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein mater in December 2oo8, Sloman became\nthe senior USAO official supervising the mater. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became\nthe Acting U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2olo, the Atorney\nGeneral appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Atorney for the district.

On this later point, they argued that Epstein “entered the public\narena only by virtue of his close personal association with former President Bill Clinton,” and that\nthere was “litle doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case\nif Mr. Epstein were just another ‘John.’” This was the first defense submission mentioning\nEpstein’s connection to President Clinton and raising the insinuation that the federal involvement\nin the investigation was due to politics.\n\nIn the May 27, 2oo8 leter to the Deputy Atorney General, Starr and Whitley used the\nexisting June 2, 2oo8 deadline for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that it made the need\nfor review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Senior Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral who was handling the mater, instructed the USAO to rescind the deadline, and on\nMay 28, 2oo8, Sloman notified Lefkouitz that the USAO had postponed the deadline pending\ncompletion of the review by the Deputy Atorney General’s office.!”° Meanwhile, the Criminal\nl68 Under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.22o, defendants are permited to depose victims, and Epstein’s\ncounsel utilized that procedure aggressively and expansively to conduct sworn interviews of multiple victims,\nincluding victims who were not part of the state prosecution, to learn information about the federal investigation.\n\nl69 In addition to having served as U.S. Atorney in two different districts, Whitley had served as Acting\nAssociate Atorney General, the Department’s third-highest position.\nl7o On May 28, 2oo8, Atorney General Mukasey was in Miami for unrelated events and had lunch at the USAO\nwith Acosta and other senior managers.

USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant.

See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a financial interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\n<span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> of the Department’s programs and operations.

Nor is there reference to the fact that police had recently\nresponded to a complaint at her home to find her “under the influence of a\nnarcotic”.\n\nThe State Atorney relies on the professionalism, the <span class=\"highlight\">integrity</span> and the skill\nof members of the Palm Beach Police Department to conduct investigations and to\nreport all material facts fairly and accurately. That is essential so that prosecutors\ncan make charging decisions consistent with the facts, the law, the appropriate\nallocation of limited resources and public policy. If police officers hide facts,\nmisstate evidence, or otherwise fail to provide prosecutors with all material\ninformation then justice cannot be served. It is our unfortunate but unmistakable\nconclusion that Detective Recarey failed to discharge his duty in this mater.\nMoreover, his decision to release to the public the Police Report and Probable\nCause Affidavits, particularly when they contained material omissions and\nmisstatements of fact, was intended to harm Epstein, ill served the criminal justice\nsystem, and ultimately failed the people of Palm Beach County.\n\nWe are prepared to provide any other information you may need in\no7/26/l7 Page 228o Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32593\n"};
