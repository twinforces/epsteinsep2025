Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only <span class=\"highlight\">offensive</span> but also uterly irrelevant given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\nirrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,\nthe Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the\nidentities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their\ncounsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying\ninformation). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly\nidentify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would\npermit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.\n\n> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested\nmodification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be\nappropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained\nwhat defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and\nthus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and\nscrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the <span class=\"highlight\">offensive</span> notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool666", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002034.jpg": "fagqe2—Re: United States v.

The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005780.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 396 Filed lo/29/2l Page6of8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v.

The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page6eof8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.” Old Chief v.

These proposals are reasonable, narrouly tailored, and not broader than\nnecessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential\nharassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other\nadverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permiting defense counsel to refer to witnesses\nby name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations\nduring their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative\nchoice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable\nthe defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.\n\nThe defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and\nher counsel should be permited to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken\non the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating\nto Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such\nsweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the\nconclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court\nproceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and\nadvocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to\nexplain hou or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,\nand the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the\nabsurd.”\n\nThe Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing.

Beyond the <span class=\"highlight\">offensive</span> notion that victims of\nsexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their\nexperience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should\nreceive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.\nPermiting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on\nthe record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no\nconceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating\nwith the Government.\nApp.o58\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022606.jpg": "Page 2l4\n\nl of the president to harm him, that I find deeply\n2 <span class=\"highlight\">offensive</span>.
