The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops <span class=\"highlight\">Northwest</span>, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l28 Filed ol/28/2l Page l of 2\nSue.

The Government notes at\nthe outset that the defendant has not proposed any redactions to certain motions filed on the docket.\n(Motions 5, 8, 9, & l2; Dkts. ll9-l26). The Government agrees that no redactions are necessary\nas to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions\nto the remaining pre-trial motions for the follouing reasons:\n\ne The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-\nprosecution agreement (Motion l) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment\ndelay (Motion 7) refer to documents designated by the Government as\n“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see\nProtective Order 4 l5 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrouly tailored\nto protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation. See, e.g.,\nDouglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops <span class=\"highlight\">Northwest</span>, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979) (“Since\nthe l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records\nof such proceedings have been kept from the public eye.

Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe Second Circuit has instructed:\n\nThe timing of the request remains one of the most crucial elements. Time maters\n\nin several ways. First, if historical interest in a specific case has persisted over a\n\nnumber of years, that serves as an important indication that the public’s interest in\n\nrelease of the information is substantial. (Hence the hypotheticals involving John\n\nWilkes Booth and Aaron Burr.)!” Second, the passage of time erodes many of the\n\njustifications for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Northwest</span>, 44l U.S. 22l, 222 (l979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy\n\nare reduced after the grand jury has ended its activities). Third, the passage of time\n\neventually, and inevitably, brings about the death of the principal parties involved\n\nin the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families. And the continued\n\nexistence and vulnerability of such parties is, of itself, a factor that a court should\n\nconsider.\nId. at lo7 (footnote added).\n\nThis factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 2o-3o years have\npassed since Maxwell (and Epstein) commited the crimes for which they were charged. (The\nconduct for which Maxwell was convicted spanned l994 to 2oo4.)\n\nOn the other hand, the grand juries that indicted Maxwell met approximately five years\nago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her conviction remains on direct appeal.\nAnd numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These circumstances starkly\ncontrast with most precedents in this line of cases, which involved testimony decades earlier.\nSee, e.g., id. at loo (l948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d at 626\n(l95o testimony); Jn re AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 277-78 (l947-l95o testimony); see also note l2,\nsupra (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less\nthan two years earlier).\n\n'’ The Circuit, in illustrating earlier in its opinion why historical or public interest considerations\ncould justify the release of grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes\nBooth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led to grand jury investigations, historical\ninterest might by nou overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” /d. at lo5.\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00018220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 749 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page ll9 of 236 lo23\nLC3KMAX4 Parkinson —- Direct\n\nl the cabana.\n\n2 MS.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops <span class=\"highlight\">Northwest</span>, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022379.jpg": "*Redactions for personal :\ncontact information ;\nral fee\ni <span class=\"highlight\">Northwest</span> Airlines Steppes East\nPF Nace Gullouitie\n: hs ron , Ls\nimmunisation\nTs Raytheon Travel Air\n, a a Travel Consolidator Eu-\na Travel Consolidators\n.
