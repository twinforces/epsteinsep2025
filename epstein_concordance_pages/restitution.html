This principle originated in the English common\n\n7 law. It was adopted by most U.S. federal courts, but more\n\n8 recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism. The rule of\n9 abatement is best explained in the Second Circuit case of\n\nlo U.S. v. Wright.\n\nll In that Wright case, two defendants had pled guilty to\nl2 embezzlement and tax evasion. Both defendants appealed, but\n\nl3 one of the defendants died while his appeal was pending in the\nl4 Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule\nl5 of abatement, the judgment of conviction against the deceased\nl6 defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to\nl7 be dismissed. The Wright court held that when a convicted\n\nl8 defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending,\nl9 his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had\n2o during the course of the prosecution.\n2l The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that\n22 when a criminal conviction abates upon the death of a\n23 defendant, any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> ordered as a result of that\n24 conviction must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with\n25 respect to associated forfeiture orders.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo646", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000690.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 52 of 86 52\nJ8RPEPS2\n\nl brought against Mr. Dershouitz, but I would have expected that\n2 the Law Journal or Professor Green himself would have disclosed\ni) that connection, which I think is a conflict.\n\n4 But regardless of the appropriateness of his\n\niy disclosure, or lack of disclosure, I think that his article\n\n6 opposing allouing the victims to have a voice in this\n\n7 proceeding is inconsistent not only with the policy that\n\n8 underlies the Crime Victim Rights Act and the very statute that\n9 Mr. Epstein is being prosecuted under, but it ignores the\n\nlo actual language of those statutes, and many other statutes, in\nll which Congress has made clear that the purpose of the criminal\nl2 law is no longer simply to punish the individual defendant, but\nl3 it is to find some way of trying to mitigate the damage that\n\nl4 has been done to the victims through <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> and economic\nl5 mitigation, but also through the ability to confront and to\n\nl6 have the court system and the justice system and the\n\nl7 prosecutors treat these victims as they are victims, as they\n\nl8 are human beings, and they are entitled to the respect that our\nl9 society needs to give every human being.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo324l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 348\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003270.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”'\"! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-oooo327o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003304.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\n\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\n\nspend a significant time in jail.\n\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\n\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*!\n\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

USAM\n§ 9-27.22o sets forth the grounds to be considered in making the decision whether to commence\nor decline federal prosecution. A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM §8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities;!”°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°* The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3325", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003326.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5o of 348\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3326", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l59 of 348\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3335", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003340.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003348.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3348", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003351.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nWwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo335l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.”**’ On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?°8\n266 H.

For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olce/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\nant Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\naus Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\nl99\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34ol", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24o of 348\nthe USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief’ to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*'* (Emphasis in original).

Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.**°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at ___—a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003418.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 242 of 348\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by ether Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States.

This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised.\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003444.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 268 of 348\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”**\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”°”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003460.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and.\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo346o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003468.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!°\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.*°\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘8 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> issue. There were legal\nissues ... . There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n3 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\not Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4363", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004376.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 79 of 349\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth. The final term sheet was as follous:\n\nto plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a\n\ncourt proceeding.\nMemorandum from Acting Deputy Atorney General Craig S.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable atorney’s fee.

On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4379", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 95 of 349\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l29 of 349\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have... a lot of victims . . . lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “‘not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\n\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\n\nthat they “‘appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Tnial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\n\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\n\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\n\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\n\nso we stopped the interview.\n\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\n\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper.

A federal prosecutor should commence or recommend prosecution\nif he or she believes that admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a\nconviction of a federal offense, unless (l) the prosecution would serve no federal interest; (2) the\nperson is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or (3) there exists an adequate\nalternative to prosecution. A comment to this provision indicates that it is the prosecutor’s task to\ndetermine whether these circumstances exist, and in making that determination, the prosecutor\n“should” consult USAM 8§ 9-27.23o, 9-27.24o, or 9-27.25o, as appropriate.\n\nUSAM § 9-27.23o sets forth a non-exhaustive list of considerations that a federal\nprosecutor should weigh in determining whether a substantial federal interest would be served by\ninitiating prosecution against a person:\n\nl. Federal law enforcement priorities; !°\n\n2. The nature and seriousness of the offense; !*!\n\n3. The deterrent effect of prosecution;\n\n4, The person’s culpability in connection with the offense;\n\n5. The person’s history with respect to criminal activity;\n\n6. The person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n\n7. The probable sentence or other consequences if the person\nis convicted.\n\nThe USAM contemplates that, on occasion, a federal prosecutor will decline to open a case\nin deference to prosecution by the state in which the crime occurred. USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements\n\nFederal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a\nplea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.33o; 9-27.4oo. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned\nby Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is\noffered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the\ntotality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.4oo, comment.!°4 The\nimportance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM\n§ 9-27.43o, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that\nrepresents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the\nl28 As previously noted, Rule ll(c)(l)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a\nspecific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.\n\nl94 See also USAM § 9-27.3oo (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the atorney for the government\nshould charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is\nlikely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).\nl23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4447", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004448.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l5l of 349\ndefendant’s criminal conduct, has an adequate factual basis, makes likely the imposition of an\nappropriate sentence and order of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, and does not adversely affect the investigation or\nprosecution of others.

USAM Provisions Relating to Non-Prosecution Agreements\nUSAM § 9-27.6oo authorizes government atorneys to enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation. The provision explains that a non-prosecution\nagreement is appropriate for this purpose when, in the prosecutor’s judgment, the person’s timely\ncooperation “appears to be necessary to the public interest and other means of obtaining the desired\ncooperation are unavailable or would not be effective.” A comment to this provision explains that\nsuch “other means” include seeking cooperation after trial and conviction, bargaining for\nl24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4448", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004457.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l6o of 349\nCHAPTER TWO\nPART THREE: ANALYSIS\n\nI. OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconceming the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4457", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l65 of 349\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.7°? Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o8 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n\nOs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004470.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l73 of 349\nrecord, no <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo447o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004473.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l76 of 349\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\neee Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4473", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004513.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l6 of 349\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”*®\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\nor OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004517.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22o of 349\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.

OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4538", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004540.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 243 of 349\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo454o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004543.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 246 of 349\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.778 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n338 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n738 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Although\nVillafafia’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, OPR\nlocated no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°® Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nA57 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victms who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\noe In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4557", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004558.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 26l of 349\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”**! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4558", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004562.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 265 of 349\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]\nwhere do you want [the] leter sent? If you have questions when\nyou receive the leter, please understand that we cannot provide\nlegal advice but the lawyers at the follouing victim rights\norganizations are able to help you at no cost to you. (Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4562", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 269 of 349\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”3®\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.*®°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA nights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA night\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\naB3 l57 Cong. Rec. 87359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\na8 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”— is “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’”*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nfab 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nso Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-oooo458o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 285 of 349\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4582", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004590.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 293 of 349\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent— Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.’ During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 294 of 349\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*!7 Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-oooo459l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004592.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 295 of 349\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o) OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s order directing\nthe Government to state its position as to whether Minor Victim-3 “could be deemed a victim of\nany of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purposes, including for purposes of\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> under l8 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).” The answer is yes. Minor Victim-3 suffered unwanted\nand traumatic sexual contact with Jeffrey Epstein when she was l7 years old. In addition to making\nher a victim in the ordinary sense of that word, it makes her a victim of the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies for at least the follouing provisions of federal law: the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\n(“CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l; the Victim and Witness Protection Act (“VWPA”), l8 U.S.C. §\n3663; and Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2.!\n\nBoth the CVRA and VWPA contain statutory definitions of the term “victim.” The CVRA\ndefines “victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a\nFederal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). The VWPA\nsimilarly defines “victim” to mean “a person directly and proximately harmed by the commission\n' Given the expedited briefing deadline, the Government has not addressed every provision of\nfederal law that references victims, but would be happy to address any additional provisions the\nCourt deems relevant.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo743l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007432.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\nof an offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). That section also expressly includes, in conspiracy cases,\n“any person directly harmed by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the . .. conspiracy\nJe? ded.\n\nA person is “directly and proximately harmed” by a commission of an offense when the\noffense is a but-for and proximate cause of their harm. See, e.g., United States v. Goodrich, l2\nF.4th 2l9, 229 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (describing the identical language in l8 U.S.C. § 3663A). The\noffense is a but-for cause if the defendant’s conduct was “‘a necessary factor in bringing about the\nvictim’s harm.” /d. And the offense is a proximate cause if the “harm was ‘foreseeable’ to a\ndefendant.” Jd. While the loss must “arise from the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\nof conviction,” id. at 228 (internal quotation marks omited), in the case of a conspiracy where an\nindividual is convicted for an “overarching scheme,” <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> is appropriate for “actions that\nwere within and necessary to that ‘single scheme.’” United States v. Seabrook, 968 F.3d 224, 236\nn.8 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Archer, 67l F.3d l49, l7l-72 (2d Cir. 2oll)). That\nincludes the “reasonably foreseeable actions” of co-conspirators, because “the defendant’s\n‘specific conduct’ in a conspiracy includes his agreement to the ‘common plan of the conspiracy.”\nGoodrich, l2 F.4th at 228.\n\nThese definitions of “victims” encompass a broader set of individuals than the set of people\nwho are injured when all elements of an offense are met. In Goodrich, for instance, a securities\nbroker-dealer “pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to manipulate” the share price of a sham company.\nl2 F.4th at 23l. His co-defendants “arranged the sale of [the company’s] shares outside the public\nmarket in a private placement,” and the broker-dealer challenged his order to pay <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for\nlosses in the private placement, because they were not victims of his offense. Jd. at 223. The\nprivate placement was not mentioned in his indictment, plea agreement, or plea allocution, id. at\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7432", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007433.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 493 Filed ll/22/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\n225, and the broker-dealer had pleaded guilty to manipulate the share price “rather than to execute\nthe private placement, id. at 23l. But that was “not conclusive”: “[t]he key question . . . is whether\nthe losses suffered by the private placement victims were ‘directly and proximately’ caused by the\nconspiracy to manipulate the public share price.” Jd. (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3663A(a)(2)); see id.\nat 234 (reversing because the record lacked adequate evidence of proximate causation); see also,\ne.g., United States v. Oladimeji, 463 F.3d l52, l59 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (affirming <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for losses\ncaused by fraudulent use of credit cards where defendant was convicted of possession of the cards\nwith intent to defraud).\n\nUnder these principles, Minor Victim-3 is a victim of the Mann Act conspiracies. Those\nconspiracies operated through a patern of recruiting minor girls, grooming them, asking them to\nmassage Epstein, and then sexualizing the massages, from l994 to 2oo4, across Epstein and the\ndefendant’s various properties. (See ll/o5/2l Gov’t Leter at 5-6, 9). It was reasonably\nforeseeable to the defendant that she and Epstein’s efforts to recruit the girls to whom Epstein was\nsexually atracted would include recruiting a seventeen-year-old—Minor Victim-3—lin the course\nof that conspiracy. And but for that recruitment, Minor Victim-3 would not have been harmed.\nSee United Sates v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (“The definition of victim under\nthe CVRA is expansive. It is not limited to those, such as Jane Doe-l and Jane Doe-2 who\nallegedly were victims of physical abuse.”); cf, e.g., United States v. Batista, 575 F.3d 226, 23l\n(2d Cir. 2oo9) (“Although Batista did not defraud the NBA directly, we conclude that the district\ncourt properly characterized the NBA as a ‘victim’ . . . because the NBA was harmed by the\nconduct commited during the course of the conspiracy to transmit wagering information.”).\nConsider, for instance, a robbery crew that conspired to commit Hobbs Act robberies.

United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 6o8, 622 (2d Cir. 2oo3). And in any\nevent, Jane recalled the incident of abuse at least as early as November 3, 2o2l. (See Def. Mot. at\n5 n.l (citing 35o9-o33 at l)). Notes from that interview were provided to the defense on November\n6, 2o2l—more than three weeks before trial. At the time, the parties were still litigating whether\nKate could testify at all. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 4l7 (order dated November 6, 2o2l, requiring the\nGovernment to brief whether Kate was a “victim” for any legal purpose, including <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>)).\nThe Court did not permit Kate to testify until November l9, 2o2l—almost two weeks after the\ndefendant received the relevant notes. (Dkt. No. 477). And follouing that decision, the parties\ncontinued to litigate the limiting instructions for Kate and Annie in advance of trial. (See, e.g.,\nll/23/2l Tr. at 28-38).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant had ample notice to seek a limiting instruction as to this portion\nof Jane’s testimony. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“rejecting a prejudice argument in part because\n“t]he government disclosed the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). The Court’s\nfailure to give one sua sponte is not a prejudicial variance. The defendant is simply characterizing\nher failure to ask for a limiting instruction at the time of Jane’s testimony as an argument that she\nwas prejudiced.

These Victims Have a Statutory Right to be Heard Under the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\nThe Crime Victim's Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e). This definition was based on earlier <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> statutes which “all demonstrate a clarion\ncongressional intent to provide <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to as many victims and in as many cases as possible.”\nUnited States v. Martin, l28 F.3d ll88, ll9o (7th Cir. l997) (quoted in United States v. Kamuvaka,\n7l9 ESupp.2d 469, 475 (E.D. Pa. 2olo)).

This is why Congress made the statutory rights under the\nCVRA permissively accessible. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(d)(3).” Id. Moreover, “[b]ecause victim status can\nbe argued for even prior to the filing of an indictment, it is clear that Congress intended courts to\nlook beyond the four corners of an indictment or plea agreement. For example, in the context of the\n[drug trafficking] conspiracy here, neither the indictment nor the statement of facts included in the\nplea agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allous for the inference...that [the\ndefendant’s] paramilitary organization...employed violence and force as part of its method of\noperation.” Jd.\n\nIt is also important to understand that this case has nou moved to a different phase than the\ntrial phase where, of course, a defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence and is protected\nby the requirement that the government prove guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But, in\ndetermining the “crime victim” issue at sentencing, the relevant standard of proof is the conventional\nstandard for proceedings in criminal cases outside of trial—preponderance of the evidence. See\nUnited States v. Giraldo-Serna, ll8 FSupp.3d 377, 382 (D.D.C. 2ol5) (“Purported victims under\nthe CVRA must prove their victim status by a preponderance of the evidence.”) (citing Jn re\nMcNulty, 597 F.3d 344, 35l (6th Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Kate has a statutory right to be heard under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nThe CVRA guarantees crime victims the right to “reasonably heard at any public\nproceeding in the district court involving ... sentencing.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). This is the right\nof a victim to give what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally\nUnited States v. Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d l34l (D. Utah 2oo5). Various courts have held that\nthe CVRA right to be reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in-court statement.\nAs one court has explained, “[a]t a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to\nthe judge. Read against this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally\nwith the defendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless\nstranger.’” Degenhardt, 4o5 F.Supp.2d at l348 (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 5ol U.S. 8o8,825\n(l99l)).\n\nThe Crime Victim’s Rights Act (“CVRA”) defines the term “crime victim” as a “person\ndirectly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense ....” l8 U.S.C.\n§ 377l(e).

Rec. $427o (Apr. 22, 2oo4) (emphasis added) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl, agreed to by Sen. Feinstein). Congress understood that it was extending rights to\n“literally millions of people’—l.e., victims who were being denied rights in the federal criminal\njustice process. l5o Cong. Rec.

It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for\nregistration, and then you had the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> issue. There were legal\nissues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial\n...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at\na pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went\nback and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a\nstate pre-indictment resolution.\nAcosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in\npart, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution\nrather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained\nthat he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the\nEpstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because\nthe defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.\nAtorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand\njury because the State Atorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or\nproceeding on a lesser charge.\n83 Menchel told OPR, houever, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were\ngenerally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”\n64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule ll is not something that [South\nFlorida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District\nof Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule\nll(c) pleas.”\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) allous the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of\na plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court\ndoes not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule ll(c) pleas\nwere “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to\nimpose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as\naverse to Rule ll(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered\na Rule ll(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.\n39\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l239", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021252.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document Sey, ae 3536o38, Page8o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 78 of 348\nas a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated.\nthat terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the\nvictims to be provided monetary compensation through l8 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>\nthat would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told\nOPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”\n\nBefore the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from\nVillafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified\nvictims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the\nmonth.

Villafafia did not have significant experience prosecuting corporate entities.\n86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal\ncriminal code at l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2oo6, to\nMarch 6, 2ol3, provided as follous:\n\nAny person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section\n\n224l(c), 2242, 2243, 225l, 225lA, 2252, 2252A, 226o, 242l, 2422, or 2423 of\n\nthis title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless\n\nof whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any\n\nappropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such\n\nperson sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable atorney’s fee. Any\n\nperson as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained\n\ndamages of no less than $l5o,ooo in value.\nVillafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that\nrequired him to register as a sexual offender; houever, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,\n2oo7 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.\n\n52\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021255.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N8l 3536o38, Page83 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8l of 348\n\ncharges in addition to state charges. On behalf of the defense team, Sanchez folloued up on the\nJuly 3l, 2oo7 meeting with an August 2, 2oo7 leter to Menchel:\n\nWe welcomed your recognition that a state prison sentence is neither\n\nappropriate for, nor acceptable to, Mr. Epstein, as the dangers of the\n\nstate prison system pose risks that are clearly untenable. We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before. He has lived an otherwise exemplary life.”\n\nThe “significantly punitive” proposal described in the defense leter involved no period of\nmandatory incarceration. Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed.\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody. Sanchez also advised that the defense\nteam was seeking a meeting with Acosta.\n\nB. In an August 3, 2oo7 Leter, the USAO States That a Two-Year Term of\n\nImprisonment Is the Minimum That Will Vindicate the Federal Interest\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she and her managers agreed the counteroffer was unacceptable,\nand she conferred with Lourie or Menchel about the government’s response. Villafafia drafted for\nMenchel’s signature a leter asserting that the USAO considered a two-year term of imprisonment\nto be the minimum sentence that would “vindicate” the federal interest in the Epstein investigation.\nVillafafia’s draft stated that the USAO “has never agreed that a state prison sentence is not\nappropriate for Mr. Epstein,” but was willing to allou Epstein to enter a guilty plea under Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure ll(c)(l)(C) to a federal felony charge with a binding recommendation\nfor a two-year term of incarceration. Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\nag The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements. Accordingly, in evaluating the subject atorneys’ conduct, OPR did not rely\non uncorroborated defense assertions.\n\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l255", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021268.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OO eNO4 3536o38, Page96 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 94 of 348\nD. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”!!! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\ni The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l268", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021298.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel26 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7— the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !**\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafafia\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nlS Villatfafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l298", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021302.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l38 3536o38, Pagel3o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l28 of 348\nthat it was to establish whether, if the plea fell apart, he, as Chief, would agree “that we can go\nforward with” the charges. He did recall being concerned, after completing the review, that “we\ndid not have ...a lot of victims... lined up and ready to testify” and that some victims might “not\nbe favorable for us.” Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposed charges were sound, and he\ntold Acosta that he would approve proceeding with a federal case.\n6. Acosta Asks CEOS to Review the Evidence\nNotwithstanding Senior’s favorable review, Acosta and Sloman told Starr and Lefkouitz\nthat they “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted a “fresh face” to conduct a review, and noted that\nthe Criminal Chief had not undertaken the “in-depth work associated with the issues raised by the\ndefense.” They told the defense team that Acosta had asked CEOS to “come on board” and that\nCEOS Chief Oosterban would designate an atorney having “a national perspective” to conduct\na fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could\nhave been there to see hou much this has affected them.\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\ntwice within a 2o minute span. She regained her composure enough\nto continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares\nabout Epstein coming after her and she started to break doun again,\nso we stopped the interview.\nThe second girl . . . told us that she was very upset about the l8\nmonth deal she had read about in the paper. She said that l8 months\nwas nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein\nspend a significant time in jail.\nThese girls deserve so much beter than they have received so far,\nand I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them.!*\nThe CEOS Trial Atorney had substantial experience prosecuting child exploitation cases.\nShe told OPR that in her view, the victim witnesses in this case presented a number of challenges\nfor a prosecution: some of the victims did not want to admit they had sexual contact with Epstein;\nsome had recruited other victims to provide Epstein massages, and thus could have been charged\nas accomplices; some had “drug histories and . . . things like that”; some could appear to have been\n“complicit”; and there was no evidence of physical violence against the victims.

USAM § 9-27.24o directs\nthat in evaluating the effectiveness of prosecution in another jurisdiction, the federal prosecutor\nshould weigh “all relevant considerations,” including the strength of the other jurisdiction’s\ninterest in prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability and willingness to prosecute effectively, and\nthe probable sentence or other consequences the person will be subject to if convicted in the other\njurisdiction.

As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the\nchoice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as\nincompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may\nbe overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior\nsentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a\nsubstantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> as well as\nimprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal\nprosecution.”\n\n(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal\noffense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and\nsustain a conviction.\n\nHouever, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a\nfederal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed\nprosecution.\n\nThe Petite policy cautions that whenever a mater involves overlapping federal and state\njurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most\nappropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests\ninvolved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular\nprosecution, the prosecutor should submit the mater to the appropriate Assistant Atorney General\nfor resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Atorney General must be obtained\nbefore bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.\n\n3.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years ..., registration and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority... . [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l333", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021338.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON G4 3536o38, Pagel66 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l64 of 348\nLongstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.”°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § I.B.6.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3s Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l344", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021346.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Pagel74 of 258\nSA-l72\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l72 of 348\nrecord, no <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l346", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021349.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON BS 3536o38, Pagel7/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l75 of 348\n\nbeen concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on. . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.””” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . I was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n228 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l349", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>; and (7) information about the conviction,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o). The relevant text of the VRRA\nis set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section l.B of this Report.\n264 l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4).

The passage of the CVRA repealed the rights portion of the VRRA (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o6), but kept intact the portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to\nprovide certain victim services, such as counseling and medical care referrals (42 U.S.C.\n§ lo6o7(c)).

THE DEPARTMENT’S INTERPRETATION OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF\n\n“CRIME VICTIM” AT THE TIME OF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°? On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”7°°\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l392", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021393.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3l9 | 3536o38, Page22l of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l9 of 348\n\nOLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe ““‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.”® The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (‘OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation.

Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021416.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 349 3536o38, Page244 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 242 of 348\nher a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”*!°\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021419.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SN 345 3536o38, Page247 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 245 of 348\nhave “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*\"3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]Jour leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end.

Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were atrial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”*°\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice... she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin fail?\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*°*> Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n335 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n336 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the ‘all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”?°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\nad Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to simply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, sucha\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document], the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l435", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021436.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document \"SA36o 3536o39, Page6 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 26o of 348\n\nWhen asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea? Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°' As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*°”\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“Tt]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\nBa) Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafia edited it further.\n3l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n3o2 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l436", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021440.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 564 3536o39, Pagelo of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 264 of 348\nl8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” *”’ The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]\nwhere do you want [the] leter sent?

(Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villatfafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l44o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021444.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 568 3536o39, Pagel4 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 268 of 348\n\nDepartment had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”>*?\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\ncd Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l444", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021449.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Pagel9 of 2l7\nSA-273\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 273 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nI.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*?°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—is “always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.’””*°’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\nao Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l458", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021460.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 384 3536o39, Page3o of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 284 of 348\n\nIn Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the nght, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l46o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021468.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3599 3536o39, Page38 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 292 of 348\nstrongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations.*\"°\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconcerning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\n4l6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021469.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 593 3536o39, Page39 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 293 of 348\n\nThereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nlagree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law. We will defer to the discretion of the State Atorney\nregarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the\nstate proceedings, although we will provide him with the\ninformation necessary to do so if he wishes.\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nAcosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this [leter] without running it by [Sloman],\nif not other individuals in the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not for me to direct the State\nAtorney, or for our office to direct the State Atorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to\nthe state outcome.” Acosta acknouledged that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s\nhandling of the case, but he told OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will not fulfill whatever\nobligation they have. Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”*’” Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[alve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\na Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l469", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021470.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 359o4 3536o39, Page4o of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 294 of 348\nparticular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*'* Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”° Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l (a)(2)).77\"\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*”\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma.

Villafafia specified that Epstein would also be required to\nconcede liability under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 for all of the victims identified during the federal\ninvestigation, “not just the l2 that formed the basis of an initial planned charging instrument.”\n\no The USAO countered, houever, that it “never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate” and that\n“a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer.” Records shou that throughout the\nEpstein mater, the USAO atorneys identified instances when defense atorneys misstated or otherwise did not\naccurately describe events or statements.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ . . . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023136.jpg": "the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

Oosterban assigned a CEOS Trial Atorney\nwho Villafafia understood was to review the case and prepare for trial in the event Epstein did not\n“consummate” the NPA. The CEOS Trial Atorney traveled to Florida to review the case\nmaterials, and to meet with Villafafia to discuss the case and interview some of the victims. After\none such meeting, Villafafia wrote to Acosta and Sloman:\n\nWe just finished interviewing three of the girls.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nIl. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, I... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023176.jpg": "Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § ILB.6.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\nBs Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... Itis\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.jpg": "record, no <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“sranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.jpg": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n72l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

April l, 2oo5 Office of Legal Counsel “Preliminary Review”\n\nIn 2oo5, Department management requested informal guidance from the Department’s\nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) regarding interpretation of the CVRA’s definition of “crime\nvictim.””°7 On April l, 2oo5, OLC provided “preliminary and informal” guidance by email,\nconcluding that “the status of a ‘crime victim’ may be reasonably understood to commence upon\nthe filing of a complaint, and that the status ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or\nprosecute the Federal offense that directly caused the victim’s harm.”?\n\n266 H. Rep. No. ll4-7 (Jan. 27, 2ol5).\n267 OLC is responsible for providing legal advice to the President, Department components, and other executive\nbranch agencies.\n\n268 The OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance is summarized in a Memorandum Opinion to the Acting Deputy Atorney\nGeneral from Deputy Assistant Atorney General John E. Bies (Dec. l7, 2olo), published as Office of Legal Counsel,\nl92\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2323o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023231.jpg": "OLC concluded that because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ as a ‘person directly and\nproximately harmed by the commission of a Federal offense,’ . . . the definition of victim is thus\ntethered to the identification of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with the filing of a\ncomplaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifies\nthe “‘rights of crime victims in the Federal judicial system’” and a complaint “commences the\n‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,’” the legislature must have\nintended for CVRA rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.\n\nOLC also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For\nexample, the first right grants a victim protection from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,\nthe second, third, and fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and access to, public proceedings\ninvolving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a\ncomplaint.”\n\nB. 2oo5 Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\n\nIn May 2oo5, the Department updated its Atorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance (2oo5 Guidelines) to include the CVRA.” The 2oo5 Guidelines specifically\ncited the CVRA requirement that agencies “engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution\nof crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded” their\nCVRA rights, which in 2oo5 encompassed the initial eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines provided detail regarding implementation of the Department’s CVRA\nduties and divided criminal cases into an “investigation stage,” a “prosecution stage,” and a\n“corrections stage.” The individuals responsible for notifying crime victims of their CVRA rights\nvaried depending on the stage of the proceedings.\n\nDuring the “investigation stage” of cases in which the FBI was the investigating agency,\nthe Special Agent in Charge was responsible for identifying the victims “[a]t the earliest\nopportunity after the detection of a crime” and notifying them of their rights under the CVRA and\nservices available under the VRRA and other federal statutes.\n\n[D]uring the investigative stage, [the Department] mandates\n\ncompliance with the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act, 42 U.S.C\n\n§ lo6o7, which requires federal officials to, among other things,\n\nidentify victims, protect victims, arrange for victims to receive\n\nreasonable protection from suspected offenders, and provide\nThe Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2oo4 (Dec. l7, 2olo) (““OLC\nAvailability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo)”) and available at htps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ole/\nopinions/2olo/l2/3 l/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf. “That [2oo5] informal guidance did not foreclose the\npossibility that other definitions would also be reasonable.” OLC Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights (2olo) at l.\n269 The 2oo5 Guidelines are set forth in relevant part in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section II of this Report.

Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\nAaT Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n28 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.jpg": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley,\n3l4 See 42 U.S.C. § lo6o7(c)(l)(B) and (c)(3).\n3l5 Emphasis in original. Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023254.jpg": "her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023257.jpg": "have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”*3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[Y]our leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023263.jpg": "in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”>*>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*78 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n385 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\nA88 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°* Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect.

Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\na8 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document), the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2327l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023272.jpg": "When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “‘was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”*°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5. Although the charges did not indicate whether they applied to\nmultiple victims, during the hearing, Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek informed the court that\n“It]here’s several” victims. When the court asked Belohlavek whether “the victims in both these\ncases [were] in agreement with the terms of this plea,” Belohlavek replied, “I have spoken to\nseveral myself and I have spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the other victim, and I believe,\n36o Sloman forwarded the draft victim notification leter to Acosta, who responded with his oun edited version\nstating, “What do you think?” Villafafa edited it further.\n36l The leter began with the statement, “On June 3o, 2oo8, Jeffrey Epstein . . . entered a plea of guilty.” A week\nafter Epstein’s state guilty plea, Villafafia notified Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that “[Epstein’s local\natorney] Jack Goldberger is back in toun today, so I am hoping that we will finalize the last piece of our agreement—\nthe victim list and Notification. If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023276.jpg": "l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]\nwhere do you want [the] leter sent?

(Provide names\nand phone numbers)\n\nAlso ask about counseling and let them knou that counseling is still\navailable even though the investigation is closed.\n\nOn July 2l, 2oo8, Villafafia sent the leter to the ll unrepresented victims whose addresses\nthe FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of\nthe leter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).\n\nD. July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\na7 A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23276", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023280.jpg": "Department had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”>*\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status\n\nWhile the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous\nfederal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge\nas “related cases,” as a mater of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous\nother cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one atorney told OPR that he resolved l6 victim\ncases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the atorney filed only 3 of the l6 cases he said\nhe resolved.\n\n385 Doe, Response to Court Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance at l (July 24,\n2ol5).\n\n242\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2328o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023285.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nPART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS\nl.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”*”°\n\nA, At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\nl28 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\ned Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023296.jpg": "In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.jpg": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.”\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023305.jpg": "Thereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We\nintend to provide victims with notice of the federal resolution, as\nrequired by law.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”4!’? Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023306.jpg": "particular charges and victims at issue. Once the hearing was scheduled, Sloman told Villafafia to\ncontact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying the victims, and on June 28, 2oo8, she reported back\nto Sloman that Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”*!® Villafafia recalled that she\nsent Reiter a list of the girls identified as victims during the federal investigation, and Reiter said\nhe would “contact as many as he could.” The contemporaneous records do not shou hou many\nor which victims, if any, Reiter contacted, and no victims were present in the courtroom. No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.’”*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\n\n4l8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\na9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v. Guevara-Toloso, No. o4-l455, 2oo5 WL\nl2lo982, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. May 23, 2oo5) (in case involving a federal charge of illegal entry after a felony conviction,\nthe court determined that victims of the predicate state conviction were not victims under the CVRA).\n“2l In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel noted that the petitioner argued “only in passing” that the government\nviolated her CVRA right “to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding . . . involving the\ncrime”; houever, the court concluded this provision “clearly appl[ies] only after the initiation of criminal\nproceedings.” Wild, 955 F.3d at l2o5 n.7, l2o8.\n422 The government’s leter to victims, follouing Epstein’s guilty pleas, informing them of the resolution of the\ncase by state plea and the availability of § 2255 relief, also appear to satisfy the potentially applicable VRRA\nrequirements to “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and to “provide\na victim the earliest possible notice of the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to\n\n268\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023313.jpg": "the federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n‘2S As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029018.jpg": "/- INTRODUCTION. — AS A CRIME VICTIM, YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT SERVICES\nBy Me is SoS eg chs om upone geet heared crea ees iba FOLLOWING RIGHTS under\nOe tren crane ace ci en Na l8 United States Code, Section 377l: Ail states have crime victims compensation programs\npete Rederal.t in os.\" Part MeEBI s Workinvouess: =o oe, @ thes - ; bl rate, and timely notice of care cests, fost wages and support, and funeral and burial\nPuce oproviding infor mationand assistance touigtimsy.

We\n\nacknouledge that your suggestion of a plea to two federal\n\nmisdemeanors was an atempt to resolve this dilemma. Our\n\nproposal is significantly punitive, and if implemented, would, we\n\nbelieve, leave litle doubt that the federal interest was demonstrably\n\nvindicated.”°\nSanchez added, “We must keep in mind that Jeffrey Epstein is a 54-year-old man who has never\nbeen arrested before.

Instead, Sanchez suggested two years of home confinement, with regular\nreporting to and visits from a community control officer; payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, damages, court\nand probationary costs, and law enforcement costs; random drug testing; community service;\npsychological counseling; and a prohibition on unsupervised contact with the victims. The leter\nspecifically referred to the victim damages-recovery procedure that the government had proposed\nunder l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and represented that Epstein was “prepared to fully fund the identified\ngroup of victims which are the focus of the [USAO] — that is, the l2 individuals noted at the\nmeeting on July 3l, 2oo7.” Under the defense proposal, the state would incarcerate Epstein only\nif he failed to comply with the terms of supervised custody.

The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus on a Potential Plea to\nFederal Charges\n\nDuring the remainder of September, Villafafia conducted plea negotiations and drafted the\nfinal NPA, mainly with Epstein atorney Jay Lefkouitz. In a September l3, 2oo7 email to CEOS\nChief Oosterban, Villafafia reported that the plea negotiations were “geting fast and furious.”\nShe said that the defense wanted to establish a “‘victim’s fund” through which Epstein could make\npayments to the victims, rather than having the victims file individual § 2255 court actions for\ndamages, which she speculated was “to keep this stuff out of the public [c]ourt files.”\n\nAccording to the email documentation, by Friday, September l4, 2oo7, the parties had\nmoved touard a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea to state charges, which\nwould allou Epstein to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a federal prison.\nVillafafia informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other colleagues that negotiations with Lefkouitz\nhad resulted in a tentative agreement for Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to\nprevent a witness from reporting a crime (l8 U.S.C. § l5l2(d)(2), which was then a one-year\nmisdemeanor), and simple assault on an airplane (l8 U.S.C. § ll3(a)(5), a six-month\nmisdemeanor). Villafafia reported that Lefkouitz “put in a pitch for only l2 months, I put in a\npitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 2o-month recommendation, and we decided that we would\nbe stuck with the l8 months.”\n\nLater that day, Villafafia sent to Lefkouitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement and information\nmirroring the agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but which she noted had\n“not yet been blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the\ntwo federal charges for which the parties would jointly recommend that he be sentenced to the\nstatutory maximum penalty of l8 months’ imprisonment folloued by 2 years of supervised release,\nand that he would also plead guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to\nengage in prostitution, for which Epstein and the State Atorney’s Office would make a joint,\nbinding recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at least 2o months in prison folloued by lo\nmonths of community control (home confinement). Although not specified in the draft agreement,\nthe negotiations evidently expected the federal and state terms would run concurrently. In addition\nto payment of <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, Epstein would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of the\nvictims identified in the federal investigation—at that point specified as numbering 4o—who\nelected to file suit for damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian ad litem would be appointed\nto communicate with the defense on the victims’ behalf.\n\nLourie, houever, quickly made clear that he was not in favor of the proposal. In response\nto Villafafia’s email about the potential federal charges, but after Villafafia sent the proposal to\nLefkouitz, Lourie told her, “The assault [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of\nsilly.”''! Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did not “like the assault\ncharge” and believed that it would not “go smooth with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we\nneed[,] let’s find a different charge.” On Saturday, September l5, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLefkouitz, using her personal email address, reporting that she had “goten some negative reaction\nul The charge was to be based on “an incident in which Epstein ‘put great pressure’ .. . on [one of his female\nassistants] to call the girls to set up appointments.”\n\n68\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23lo6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023136.tif": "the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF.

In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial setlements.”\n\nl4 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E.

OVERVIEW\n\nFollouing the Miami Herald report in November 2ol8, media scrutiny of and public\natention to the USAO’s handling of its Epstein investigation has continued unabated. At the heart\nof the public’s concern is the perception that Epstein’s l8-month sentence, which resulted in a l3-\nmonth term of actual incarceration, was too lenient and inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal\nconduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from\nEpstein’s conduct, the public has received only limited information regarding the decision-making\nprocess leading to the signed NPA. As a result, questions have arisen about Acosta and his staff’s\nmotivations for entering into the NPA. Publicly released communications between prosecutors\nand defense counsel, the leniency of the sentence, and an unusual non-prosecution provision in the\nNPA have led to allegations that Acosta and the USAO gave Epstein a “sweetheart deal” because\nthey were motivated by improper influences, such as their preexisting and personal relationships\nwith his atorneys, or even corrupt influences, such as the receipt of personal benefits from Epstein.\n\nThrough its investigation, OPR has sought to answer the follouing core questions: (l) who\nwas responsible for the decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA and for its\nspecific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its provisions violate Department policies or other rules\nor regulations; and (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by\nimproper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that available records and witness\ninterviews shed light on these questions, OPR shous in detail the process that led to the NPA, from\nthe initial complaint to the USAO through the intense and often confusing negotiation process.\nAfter a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporaneous records and extensive\ninterviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR is able to answer most of the significant questions\nconcerning the NPA’s origins and development. Although some questions remain, OPR sets forth\nits conclusions and the bases for them in this Part.\nI. ACOSTA REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND IS\n\nACCOUNTABLE FOR IT\n\nAlthough Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knouledge of its terms. He\nrevised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR that\nhe either was informed of, or had access to information concerning, the underlying facts of the\ncase against Epstein. OPR did not find any evidence suggesting that any of his subordinates misled\nhim about the facts or withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta\ndid not make such a claim to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in his OPR interview, the “three pronged\nresolution, two years .. . , registration and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, . . . ultimately that was approved on my\nauthority. ... [U]ltimately, I approved it, and so, l... accept that. I’m not... pushing away\nresponsibility for it.”\n\nIn making its misconduct assessments, OPR considers the conduct of subjects individually.\nMenchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia were involved in the mater to varying degrees, at\nl33\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l7l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023176.tif": "Longstanding Department policy directs prosecutors to require the defendant to plead to the most\nserious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the defendant’s criminal\nconduct, that has an adequate factual basis, is likely to result in a sustainable conviction, makes\nlikely the imposition of an appropriate sentence and <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> order, and does not adversely affect\nthe investigation or prosecution of others. See USAM §8§ 9-27.43o, 9-27-3oo, 9-27.4oo\n(comment). The genesis of this policy, the Ashcroft Memo, specifically requires federal\nprosecutors to charge and pursue all readily provable charges that would yield the most substantial\nsentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. Houever, the Ashcroft Memo articulates an important\nexception: a U.S. Atorney or a “designated supervisory atorney” may authorize a plea that does\nnot comport with this policy.*°’ Moreover, the Ashcroft Memo explains that a charge is not\n“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors “‘a good faith doubt,” based on either the law or the\nevidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial.\n\nBy its plain terms, the NPA arguably does not appear to satisfy the “most serious readily\nprovable charge” requirement. The draft indictment prepared by Villafafia proposed charging\nEpstein with a variety of federal crimes relating to sexual conduct with and trafficking of minors,\nand Epstein’s sentencing exposure under the federal guidelines was in the range of l68 to 2lo\nmonths’ imprisonment. The original “term sheet” presented to the defense proposed a “non-\nnegotiable” requirement that Epstein plead guilty to three state offenses, in addition to the original\nstate indictment, with a joint, binding recommendation for a two-year term of incarceration.\nInstead, Epstein was permited to resolve his federal criminal exposure with a plea to the state\nindictment and only one additional state offense, and an l8-month sentence.\n\nAs discussed more fully later in this Report, Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie\nperceived risks to going forward to trial on the federal charges Villafafia outlined in the prosecution\nmemorandum and identified for OPR concerns with both the evidence and legal theories on which\na federal prosecution would be premised. On the other hand, Villafafia felt strongly that federal\ncharges should be brought, and the CEOS Chief reviewed the prosecution memorandum and twice\nopined that the charges were appropriate. OPR found it unnecessary to resolve the question\nwhether federal charges against Epstein were readily provable, houever, because Acosta had\n2o7 In addition to specified “Limited Exceptions,” this authorization is available in “Other Exceptional\nCircumstances,” as follous:\n\nProsecutors may decline to pursue or may dismiss readily provable charges in\n\nother exceptional circumstances with the writen or otherwise documented\n\napproval of an Assistant Atorney General, United States Atorney, or designated\n\nsupervisory atorney. This exception recognizes that the aims of the Sentencing\n\nReform Act must be sought without ignoring the practical limitations of the\n\nfederal criminal justice system. For example, a case-specific approval to dismiss\n\ncharges in a particular case might be given because the United States Atorney’s\n\nOffice is particularly over-burdened, the duration of the trial would be\n\nexceptionally long, and proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total\n\nnumber of cases disposed of by the office. Houever, such case-by-case\n\nexceptions should be rare; otherwise the goals of fairness and equity will be\n\njeopardized.\nAshcroft Memo at § ILB.6.

This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated\nany plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with\ndefense counsel Lefkouitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also\nconsidered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course\nof negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end\nfederal involvement altogether and return the mater to the state authorities to handle as they saw\nfit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,\ndespite a strong push by the defense that it do so.\n3. Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records\nIdentified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal\nTheories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims\n\nAcosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content\nof discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for\nAcosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia\nidentified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that\neither did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely\ninfluenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the\nevidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, houever,\nthese factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge\ndisposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation\nthrough a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns\nabout intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement\nauthorities.\n\nIn a declaration submited to the district court in 2ol7 in connection with the CVRA\nlitigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation\nthrough the NPA:\n\nPrior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in\n\nnegotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,\n\nand informed them that most of the victims had expressed\n\nsignificant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is\n\nmy understanding from these and other discussions that these\n\nfactors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and\n\nthe various competing interests of the many different victims\n\n(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with\n\nthe Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration\n\nfor Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims,\nAcosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their\ncolleagues, was motivated by improper influences.\n\nl44\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l82", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023184.tif": "record, no <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of\nthe names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed\nand the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their\nfamilies.\n\nAlthough his emails shoued that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,\nLourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the\nmater had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal\nprosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the\ncooperation and desires of the victims.”\n\nSimilarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled\nunderstanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced\nadditional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.\nMenchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,\nEpstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh\nthe risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained\nthrough a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual\noffender, and made <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to his victims.\n\nSloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the\ngovernment’s legal theories. He told OPR:\n\n[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going\nto be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to\nbe severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who\nthought he was a Svengali . . . who were going to say I told him I\nwas l8 years old.\n\nYou had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light\nbeing shoun on them because their parents didn’t even knou -- had\nvery vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.\n\nAcosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’\ngeneral credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which\nfactored into the resolution. He acknouledged that his understanding of the facts was not\n“granular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,\nbut he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make\nrecommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts\nwith Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding\nof the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably\nbelieved, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose\nsignificant evidentiary challenges.\n\nOther witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,\nincluding the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims\nhad expressed concern for their safety and “a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and\n\nl46\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l84", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023187.tif": "been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not\nremember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite\npolicy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping\nour bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Atorney’s Office that\nwas resolved by the State Atorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel\nremembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried\nabout “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although\nMenchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.\n\nC. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the\n\nSubjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences\n\nOPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a\nsuggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3l, 2oo7 terms was driven by corruption, a\ndesire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.\n\nFirst, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was\nto benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA\nrequired Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism\nfor the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the mater had been abandoned\nand sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s\natorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation\nand that his conduct was exclusively a mater of state concern. If the USAO had declined to\nintervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would\nhave meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely\nwould have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on\nthe wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, houever, the USAO devised\na resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address\nthe seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the\nstate’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to\nintervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather\nthan exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that\nhe was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s\nrepeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to\n22l Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was\nnot.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”\n\n222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”\nby shouing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia\nrecounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense atorney who argued in one meeting that—\n\nwe were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that\n\na number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he\n\nsaid, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we\n\npointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were\n\nprosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.\n\nl49\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l87", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.tif": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

Acosta told OPR, “I’ve had no other case where I’m even aware of victims being notified,\nbecause I assume it all operates without it rising to management level.” Similarly, Menchel told\nOPR,\n\n277 Villafafia told OPR that she thought that “at one point,” she shoued the leter to the USAO’s Victim Witness\nSpecialist who “said it was fine.” The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist told OPR that because the USAO did not\nfile a charging document in the Epstein mater, the USAO did not obtain VNS information from the FBI and did not\nassume responsibility for victim contact. The USAO’s Victim Witness Specialist had no contact with Epstein’s\nvictims, and OPR’s examination of VNS data revealed no USAO case number linked to the FBI’s VNS data\nconcerning the Epstein investigation. OPR did locate some victim contact information in the VNS relating to the\nUSAO’s case number associated with the Epstein-related CVRA litigation filed in July 2oo8.\n278 Through its administration of the Crime Victims Fund, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime\nsupports programs and services to help victims of crime.\n279 Villafafia informed OPR that, as the USAO Project Safe Childhood Coordinator [focusing on prosecutions\nof individuals who exploit children through the internet], she “treated the [Guidelines] as a floor and tried to provide\na higher standard of contact.”\n\nl99\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23237", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023252.tif": "the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement and “the use of Section 2255.” The Starr and\nLefkouitz leter asserted it was “wholly inappropriate” for the USAO to send the proposed victim\nnotification leter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly urg[ed]” Acosta to withhold the\nnotification leter until after the defense was able “to discuss this mater with Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Fisher.”\n\nThe follouing day, Sloman sent a leter to Lefkouitz, with copies to Acosta and Villafafia,\nasserting that the VRRA obligated the government to notify victims of the l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nproceedings as “other relief” to which they were entitled. Sloman also stated that the VRRA\nobligated the government to provide the victims with information concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which\nthey may be entitled and “the earliest possible’ notice of the status of the investigation, the filing\nof charges, and the acceptance of a plea.*!4 (Emphasis in original). Sloman added:\n\nJust as in l8 U.S.C. § 377l [the CVRA], these sections are not\n\nlimited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-\n\nProsecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by\n\nallouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims\n\nidentified through the federal investigation should be appropriately\n\ninformed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the\n\nU.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations.*!°\nSloman also addressed the defense objection to advising the victims to contact Villafafia or the\nFBI case agent with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have the\n‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised\nthe defense: “The three victims who were notified prior to your objection had questions directed\nto Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those questions are appropriately directed to\nlaw enforcement.”\n\nAlong with this leter, Sloman forwarded to Lefkouitz for comment a revised draft victim\nnotification leter that was substantially similar to the prior draft provided to the defense. The\nleter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would\nplead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of imprisonment at sentencing,\nand Epstein would compensate victims for damage claims brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The\nleter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea hearing:\n\nAs I mentioned above, as part of the resolution of the federal\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed to plead guilty to state charges.\n\nMr. Epstein’s change of plea and sentencing will occur on\n\nDecember l4, 2oo7, at —_ a.m., before Judge Sandra K.

Sloman also stated that the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is\nsimply informing the victims of their rights.” Villafafia informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the leter,\nbut she was the primary author of the document. OPR notes that Villafafia was the principal author of most\ncorrespondence in the Epstein case, and that follouing the signing of the NPA, regardless of whether the leter went\nout with her, Sloman’s, or Acosta’s signature, the three atorneys reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence\nbefore a final version was sent to the defense.\n\n2l4\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23252", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023254.tif": "her a victim for purposes of the federal charges, and continued to treat her as a victim because she\nwanted “to go above and beyond in terms of caring for the victims.”?\"®\n\nE. December l9, 2oo7: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to\n\nthe State Atorney the Decision Whether to Notify Victims of the State Plea\nHearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as\nRequired by Law”\n\nOn December ll, 2oo7, Starr transmited to Acosta two lengthy submissions authored by\nLefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to “the background and conduct of\nthe investigation” into Epstein. Regarding issues relevant to victim notification, in his transmital\nleter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes involving [§] 2255 notification to the alleged victims\nput illustratively in bold relief our concerns that the ends of justice, time and time again, are not\nbeing served.” By way of example, Starr complained the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it\nwas clear from the girl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a\nvictim.”\n\nIn his submissions, Lefkouitz argued that the government was not required to notify\nvictims of the § 2255 provision:\n\nVillafafia’s decision to utilize a civil remedy statute in the place of\na <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> fund for the alleged victims eliminates the notification\nrequirement under the Justice for All Act of 2oo4, a federal law that\nrequires federal authorities to notify victims as to any available\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, not of any potential civil remedies. Despite this fact,\n[she] proposed a Victims Notification leter to be sent to the alleged\nfederal victims.\n\nLefkouitz also argued that a victim trust fund would provide a more appropriate\nmechanism for compensating the victims than the government’s proposed use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255,\nand a trust fund would not violate Epstein’s due process rights. Lefkouitz took issue with the\ngovernment’s “assertion” that the USAO was obligated to send a victim notification leter to the\nalleged victims, or even that it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkouitz further argued\nthat the government misinterpreted both the CVRA and the VRRA, because neither applied to a\npublic, state court proceeding involving the entry of a plea on state charges.\n\nIn a leter from Villafafia to Lefkouitz, responding to his allegations that she had\ncommited misconduct, she specifically addressed the “false” allegations that the government had\n3l8 As noted previously, in April 2oo7, this victim gave a video-recorded interview to the FBI that was favorable\nto Epstein. Villafafia told OPR she was instructed by either Sloman or Acosta “not to consider [this individual] as a\nvictim for purposes of the NPA because she was not someone whom the Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal\ncharging document. Accordingly, the victim who became “Jane Doe #2” was not included on the victim list ultimately\nfurnished to the defense. The atorney who was representing this victim at the time of her FBI interview was paid by\nEpstein, and she subsequently obtained different counsel.\n\n2l6\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23254", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023257.tif": "have “notified [the victims] that that was an all-encompassing plea, that that state court sentence\nwould also mean that the federal government was not proceeding.”\n\nSloman told OPR that he thought Acosta and Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney\nGeneral Sigal Mandelker had agreed that the decision whether to notify the victims of the state\ncourt proceedings should be “left to the state.”°3 Mandelker, houever, had no memory of advising\nAcosta to defer the decision to make notifications to the State Atorney, and she noted that the\n“correspondence [OPR] provided to me from that time period” discussing such a decision\n“demonstrates that all of the referenced language came from Mr. Acosta and/or his team, and that\nI did not provide, suggest, or edit the language.” Sloman told OPR that he initially believed that\n“the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially because they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights\nunder § 2255”; but, his expectations changed after “there was an agreement made that we were\ngoing to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to decide hou the victims were going\nto be notified.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that she did not at any time receive a victim\nlist from the USAO. She further said she did not receive any request from the USAO with regard\nto contacting the victims.\n\nIn response to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter, Lefkouitz asserted that the FBI should\nnot communicate with the victims, and that the state, not the USAO, should determine who can be\nheard at the sentencing hearing:\n\n[YJour leter also suggests that our objection to your Office’s\n\nproposed victims notification leter was that the women identified\n\nas victims of federal crimes should not be notified of the state\n\nproceedings. That is not true, as our previous leter clearly states.\n\nPuting aside our threshold contention that many of those to whom\n\n[CVRA] notification leters are intended are in fact not victims as\n\ndefined in the Atorney General’s 2ooo Victim Witness\n\nGuidelines—a status requiring physical, emotional or pecuniary\n\ninjury of the [victim]—it was and remains our position that these\n\nwomen may be notified of such proceedings but since they are\n\nneither witnesses nor victims to the state prosecution of this mater,\n\nthey should not be informed of fictitious “rights” or invited to make\n\nsworn writen or in-court testimonial statements against Mr. Epstein\n\nat such proceedings, as Ms. Villafafia repeatedly maintained they\n\nhad the right to do. Additionally, it was and remains our position\n\nthat any notification should be by mail and that all proactive efforts\n\nby the FBI to have communications with the witnesses after the\n\nexecution of the Agreement should finally come to an end. We\n\nagree, houever, with your December l9 modification of the\n\npreviously drafted federal notification leter and agree that the\n323 In his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Mark Filip, Sloman wrote, “Acosta again consulted\nwith DAAG Mandelker who advised him to make the follouing proposal [to defer notification to the State Atorney’s\nOffice].” OPR found no other documentation relating to Mandelker’s purported involvement in the decision.\n\n2l9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23257", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023263.tif": "in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterban that she\nanticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”\n\nOn January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Atorney, and the FBI interviewed three\nvictims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January lo, 2oo8\nleter stating that the case was under investigation; houever, according to the case agent, Wild and\ntwo other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2oo7, that the case had been resolved.\nIn her 2ol5 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI leter, she believed\nthat the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential\nresolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n\nNPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2ol7 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia\nrecalled interviewing Wild on January 3l, 2oo8, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR\nshe “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled\nWild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to\ntestify.”*°>\n\nAfter the first three victim interviews on January 3l, 2oo8, Villafafia described for Acosta\nand Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:\n\nOne girl broke doun sobbing so that we had to stop the interview\n\ntwice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming\n\nafter her and she started to break doun again so we stopped the\n\ninterview.\n\nThe second girl .. . was very upset about the l8 month deal she had\n\nread about in the paper.**° She said that l8 months was nothing and\n\nthat she had heard that the girls could get <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>, but she would\n\nrather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time\n\nin jail.3°7\nVillafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman atend the interviews with victims\nscheduled for the follouing day, but neither did so.*78 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”\n335 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.\n336 See Dareh Gregorian, “Tycoon Perved Me at l4 - $5oM Suit Hits NY Creep Over Mansion Massage,” New\nYork Post, Jan. 25, 2oo8.

Although\nVillafafia’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, OPR\nlocated no corresponding reports for those victim interviews.

Acosta told OPR that he\nbelieved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal\ncase “and [the victims would] have an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”\nNevertheless, Acosta did not knou whether the state victims overlapped with the federal victims\nor whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” Villafafia told OPR that she and Acosta\n“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were aware “that\nthe state only believed they had one victim.”*°° Villafafia told OPR that there was “very litle”\ncommunication between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office, and although she discussed a\nfactual proffer with the State Atorney’s Office and “the fact that . . . the federal investigation had\nidentified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the specific people were that they\nconsidered victims in the state case.”*°?\n\nSloman told OPR that the “public perception . . . that we tried to hide the fact of the results\nof this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:\n\n[E]ven though we didn’t have a legal obligation, I felt that the\n\nvictims were going to be notified and the state was going . .. to\n\nfulfill that obligation, and even as another failsafe, [the victims]\n\nwould be notified of . . . the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> mechanism that we had set\n\nup on their behalf.\nSloman acknouledged that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims,\n\nit was [of] concern that this was going to break doun and... . result\n\nin us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be\n\nwitnesses and if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey,\n\nyou’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s . . . going to be instant\n\nimpeachment for the defense.\n387 Assistant State Atorney Belohlavek told OPR that federal victims who were not a party to the state case\nwould not have been able to stmply appear at the state plea hearing and participate in the proceedings. Rather, such a\npresentation would have required coordination between the USAO and the State Atorney’s Office and additional\ninvestigation of the victims’ allegations and proposed statements by the State Atorney’s Office.\n358 In an email a few months earlier, Villafafia noted, “The state indictment [for solicitation of adult prostitution]\nis related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal [charging document), the other is not.”\n359 As noted in Chapter Two, Villafafia had stopped communicating with the State Atorney’s Office regarding\nthe state case follouing Epstein’s defense team’s objections to those communications.\n\n233\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2327l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023272.tif": "When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing,\nSloman responded that he “was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions. I didn’t get the sense\nthat the victims were overly interested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n\nAlso, in late June, Villafafia drafted a victim notification leter concerning the June 3o,\n2oo8 plea.*°° Villafafia told OPR that, because “Mr. Acosta had agreed in December 2oo7 that we\nwould not provide writen notice of the state change of plea, the writen victim notifications were\nprepared to be sent immediately follouing Epstein’s guilty plea.”°°! As she did with prior draft\nvictim notification leters, Villafafia provided the draft to the defense for comments.*\n\nAlthough Epstein’s plea hearing was set for June 3o, 2oo8, Villafafia took steps to facilitate\nthe filing of federal charges on July l, 2oo8, in the event he did not plead guilty in state court.\n\nOPR reviewed voluminous Epstein-related files that the State Atorney’s Office made\navailable online, but OPR was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing\ndate, the state informed victims of the June 3o, 2oo8 plea. On March l2, 2oo8, the State Atorney’s\nOffice issued trial subpoenas to three victims and one non-law enforcement witness commanding\nthe individuals to “remain on call” during the week of July 8, 2oo8. Houever, the Palm Beach\nCounty Sheriff was unable to serve one of the victims in person because the victim was “away [at]\ncollege.”\nXI. JUNE 3o, 2oo8: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS GUILTY PLEAS IN A STATE COURT\n\nHEARING AT WHICH NO VICTIMS ARE PRESENT\n\nOn June 3o, 2oo8, Epstein appeared in state court in West Palm Beach, with his atorney\nJack Goldberger, and pled guilty to an information charging him with procuring a person under l8\nfor prostitution, as well as the indictment charging him with felony solicitation of prostitution. The\ninformation charged that between August l, 2oo4, and October 9, 2oo5, Epstein “did knouingly\nand unlawfully procure for prostitution, or caused to be prostituted, [REDACTED], a person under\nthe age of l8 years,” and referred to no other victims. The indictment did not identify any victims\nand alleged only that Epstein engaged in the charged conduct on three occasions between August\nl, 2oo4, and October 3l, 2oo5.

If I face resistance on that front, I will let you knou.”\n362 According to Villafafia, either Acosta or Sloman made the decision to send the notifications follouing the\nstate plea and to share the draft notification leters with the defense.\n\n234\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23272", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023276.tif": "l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to\nname as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second\nleter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.\n\nVillafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to\nthe listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to\nconfirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,\nVillafafia proposed the follouing language to the case agents:\n\nWe are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein\ninvestigation and to thank you for your help.\n\nMr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him\nto register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of l8\nmonths imprisonment folloued by one year of home confinement.\nMr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of\n<span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span>.\n\nAll of these terms are set out in a leter that AUSA Villafafia is going\nto send out.

July — August 2oo8: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Leter to Victims\n\nResiding Outside of the United States\n\nWhile atempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact\ninformation for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2oo8,\nrespectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmited an automated VNS form notification leter to\neach victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This\n37l A month later, in an August l8, 2oo8 leter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim\nlist to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2oo7 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised\nwith Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to\ninclude new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2oo8 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously\ngiven a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a\nleter confirming that the government’s July lo, 2oo8 victim list was “the final list.”\n\n238\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23276", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023280.tif": "Department had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to\nassert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December\n2olo opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting\nthat “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective\nplea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”>*\n\nIn 2ol5, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the follouing two rights:\n\n(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain\nor deferred prosecution agreement.\n\n(lo) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the\nservices described in section 5o3(c) of the Victims’ Rights and\n<span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o (42 U.S.C. lo6o7(c)) and provided contact\ninformation for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the\nDepartment of Justice.\n\nG.

As the parties\nagreed on setlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.**4 Several of the victims who had\nsetled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their\nanonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**\n\nIn the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights\nto confer by (l) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending leters to the\nvictims claiming that the mater was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and\n(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal\ninvestigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right\nto be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right\nto reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the\nNPA and resolved the federal investigation.\n\nDuring the litigation, the USAO argued that (l) the victims had no right to notice or\nconferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s\n383 l57 Cong. Rec. $7359-o2 (2oll) (Kyl leter and Department response).\n\n384 Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well.

In September 2oo7, when the NPA was signed, the Department did not\ninterpret CVRA rights to atach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal\ncourts had not established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal\ncharges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR does not find\nprofessional misconduct unless a subject atorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and\nunambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that the subject atorneys’ conduct did not rise to\nthe level of professional misconduct. OPR nevertheless concludes that the lack of consultation\nwas part of a series of government interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court\ncondemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as\na whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and\nconfusion that victims of a crime endure in its wake.”?”°\n\nA. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to\n\nNotify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of\nCriminal Charges\n\nAlthough the rights enumerated in the CVRA are clear on their face, the threshold issue of\nwhether an individual qualifies as a victim to whom CVRA rights atach was neither clear nor\nunambiguous at the time the USAO entered into the NPA with Epstein in September 2oo7. At that\ntime, the Department interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed markedly from the district\ncourt’s later interpretation in the CVRA litigation.\n\nThe CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a\nresult of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” On April\nl, 2oo5, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded that “the status of a ‘crime victim’\nmay be reasonably understood to commence upon the filing of a criminal complaint, and that the\nstatus ends if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosecute the Federal offense that\ndirectly caused the victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2oo5 OLC guidance, the Department has\nconsistently taken the position that CVRA rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal\ncharges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied its\ndefinition to all eight CVRA rights in effect in 2oo5, but noted that the obligation created by the\neighth CVRA right—to “‘treat[] victims with fairness and respect”—ls “‘always expected of Federal\nofficials, and the Victims’ Rights and <span class=\"highlight\">Restitution</span> Act of l99o [(VRRA)] indicates that this right\napplies ‘throughout the criminal justice process.””*”’ Consistent with the OLC interpretation, in\nMay 2oo5, the Department issued the 2oo5 Guidelines to implement the CVRA.\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines assigned CVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the\ninitiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution\nstage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of,\n396 2oo5 Guidelines, Foreword.\n\n397 Nevertheless, the portion of the VRRA referenced in the OLC 2oo5 Informal Guidance, 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6,\nhad been repealed upon passage of the CVRA.\n256\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23294", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023296.tif": "In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel compared the language of the CVRA to the language\nof the VRRA, noting that the VRRA “clearly extends victim-notice rights into the pre-charge\nphase” and opining that the government “may well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its\ninvestigation of Epstein. As a predecessor to the CVRA, the VRRA afforded victims various rights\nand services; houever, it provided no mechanism for a victim to assert such rights in federal court\nor by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion of the VRRA established the\nvictims’ right to be treated with fairness and respect and the right to confer with an atorney for\nthe government. Houever, the rights portion of the VRRA was repealed upon passage of the\nCVRA and was not in effect at the time of the Epstein investigation.\n\nThe portion of the VRRA directing federal law enforcement agencies to provide certain\nvictim services such as counseling and medical care referrals remained in effect follouing passage\nof the CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a responsible official\nto “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and\nanother requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a victim the earliest possible notice of\nthe status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and\nto the extent that it will not interfere with the investigation”’—may have applied to the Epstein\ninvestigation. Houever, the VRRA did not create a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part\nof the subject atorneys, as the 2oo5 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the two\nrequirements to the investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not\nrequire notice to victims before the NPA was signed because, at that point, the case remained\n“under investigation,” and the victims did not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under\nthe NPA until Epstein entered his guilty pleas in June 2oo8. Once Epstein did so, and the victims\nidentified by the USAO became entitled to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished the\nvictims with appropriate notification.\n\nB. OPR Did Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of Consultation Was\n\nIntended to Silence Victims\n\nDuring her OPR interviews, Villafafia recalled more than one discussion in which she\nraised with her supervisors the issue of consulting with the victims before the NPA was signed on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, houever, had no recollection of\ndiscussions about consulting victims before the NPA was signed, and Menchel disputed\nVillafafia’s assertions. OPR found only one writen reference before that date, explicitly raising\nthe issue of consultation. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR was unable to\nconclusively determine whether the lack of consultation stemmed from an affirmative decision\nmade by one or more of the subjects or whether the subjects discussed consulting the victims about\nthe NPA before it was signed. Villafafia’s recollection suggests that Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman\nmay have been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of plea negotiations and did not\nbelieve that the government was obligated to consult with victims about such negotiations. OPR\nConduct l.3, lack of diligence, and 8.4(d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding in Smith\nwas based on Article 47 of the Maryland Constitution and various specific statutes affording victims the right, among\nothers, to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or\ninformation filed in a circuit court.” Houever, both the underlying statutory provisions and, significantly, the facts\nare substantially different from the Epstein investigation. In Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea.\n\n258\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23296", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023304.tif": "strongly objected to the government’s plan to notify victims of the state proceedings, which he\ndescribed as “highly inappropriate” and an “intrusion into state affairs, when the identified\nindividuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being sentenced.”\n\nThereafter—at a time when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to be imminent—Villafafia\ndrafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2oo7 leter to Lefkouitz rejecting the defense\narguments regarding notification and reiterating the USAO’s position that the victims identified in\nthe federal investigation be invited to appear at the state plea hearing. The leter took an expansive\nview of the applicable statutes by contending that both the CVRA and the VRRA required the\nUSAO to notify the victims of the state proceedings:\n\n[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings in a federal district\ncourt. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal\ninvestigation by allouing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense.\nThe victims identified through the federal investigation should be\nappropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does\nnot require the U.S. Atorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal\nobligations. *!®\n\nThe leter also asserted that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with\ninformation concerning <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> to which they may be entitled and “the earliest possible” notice\nof the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and the acceptance of a plea. Along with\nthe leter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim notification leter to Lefkouitz for his\ncomments. This draft victim notification leter stated that the federal investigation had been\ncompleted, Epstein would plead guilty in state court, the parties would recommend l8 months of\nimprisonment at sentencing, and Epstein would compensate victims for monetary damages claims\nbrought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft victim notification leter provided specific information\nconceming the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited the victims to atend or provide a\nwriten statement to the State Atorney’s Office. When Lefkouitz asked Sloman to delay sending\nvictim notifications until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman instructed Villafafia, who was\npreparing leters for transmital to 3o victims, to “Hold the leter.” During his OPR interview,\nSloman recalled that he had “wanted to push the leter out,” but he “must have had a conversation\nwith somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that conversation he directed\nVillafafia to hold the leter.\n\nIn his response leter to Acosta, Lefkouitz contended that the government had\nmisinterpreted both the CVRA and VRRA because neither applied to the “public proceeding in\nthis mater [which] will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state charges.”\nAl6 Sloman told Lefkouitz the USAO did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but “is simply informing the\nvictims of their rights.” Sloman also addressed the defense atorneys’ objection to advising the victims that they could\ncontact Villafafia or the FBI case agent with questions or concerns by referencing the CVRA, noting, “Again, federal\nlaw requires that victims have the ‘reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the Government in this case.””\n\n266\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023305.tif": "Thereafter, in his December l9, 2oo7 leter to defense counsel mainly addressing other\nmaters, Acosta informed the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Atorney’s discretion\nthe responsibility for notifying victims about Epstein’s state plea hearing:\n\nI understand that the defense objects to the victims being given\nnotice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]\nsentencing hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim\nnotification leter and the statute. I would note that the United States\nprovided the draft leter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition,\nFirst Assistant United States Atorney Sloman already incorporated\nin the leter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel.\nI agree that Section 377l applies to notice of proceedings and results\nof investigations of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime.

Let’s not assume. . . that the State Atorney’s office is full of bad actors.”\nSloman initially believed that “the victims were going to be notified at some level, especially\nbecause they had <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was\nan agreement made that we were going to allou the state, since it was going to be a state case, to\ndecide hou the victims were going to be notified.”4!’? Sloman told OPR he had been “proceeding\nunder the belief that we were going to notify the victims,” even though “this was not a federal\ncase,” but once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns that if\nwe g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then the victims would be\ninstantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary compensation.”\n\nOPR could not determine whether the State Atorney’s Office notified any victims in\nadvance of the June 3o, 2oo8 state plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that the State Atorney’s Office\nhad a robust and effective victim notification process and staff, but he was not aware of whether\nor hou it was used in the Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could not recall whether\nvictims were notified of the hearing nor whether the state law required notification for the\naly Sloman stated in his June 3, 2oo8 leter to Deputy Atorney General Filip that Acosta made the decision\ntogether with the Department’s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Atorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult\nwith Mandelker about the § 2255 civil damages recovery process, but neither Acosta nor Mandelker recalled\ndiscussing the issue of victim notification, and OPR found no other documentation indicating that Mandelker played\na role in the deferral decision.\n\n267\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233o5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023306.tif": "particular charges and victims at issue.

No victim\nwho provided information to OPR, either in person or through her atorney, recalled receiving\nnotice of the plea hearing from federal or state officials. At the time Epstein pled guilty in state\ncourt, no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the State Atorney’s Office had\nnotified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafafia, who was present in the courtroom for the\nhearing, had no knouledge to whom Belohlavek referred when she told the court that the victims\nwere “in agreement with the terms of this plea.””*!”\n\nOPR considered whether Acosta’s decision to defer to the State Atorney’s Office the\ndecision to notify victims of the scheduled date for Epstein’s plea hearing constituted professional\nmisconduct. OPR could not conclude that the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring\nnotice of any public proceeding involving the crime against the victim or that the victim is entitled\nto atend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.\nFurthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued guidance stating that the CVRA did not\napply to cases in which no federal charges had been filed.*”” Moreover, the section of the VRRA\nrequiring notice of court proceedings that the victim is “entitled to atend” referred specifically to\nproceedings under 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b)(4), which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become\npart of the CVRA (l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(2)).7!\n\nBecause Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty to inform victims identified in the\nfederal investigation of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State\nAtorney the decision to notify victims of the state’s plea hearing and the responsibility for doing\nso did not constitute professional misconduct.*””\nal8 Sloman replied, “Good.” In her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make\noral notifications to the victims regarding the upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification\ncould only come from a state investigator, and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”\n\n4l9 Plea Hearing Transcript at 42.\n42o OLC 2oo5 CVRA Informal Guidance; see also United States v.

May 23, 2oo5) (in case involving a federal charge of illegal entry after a felony conviction,\nthe court determined that victims of the predicate state conviction were not victims under the CVRA).\n42l In Wild, the Eleventh Circuit panel noted that the petitioner argued “only in passing” that the government\nviolated her CVRA right “to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding . . . involving the\ncrime”; houever, the court concluded this provision “clearly appl[ies] only after the initiation of criminal\nproceedings.” Wild, 955 F.3d at l2o5 n.7, l2o8.\n422 The government’s leter to victims, follouing Epstein’s guilty pleas, informing them of the resolution of the\ncase by state plea and the availability of § 2255 relief, also appear to satisfy the potentially applicable VRRA\nrequirements to “inform a victim of any <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and to “provide\na victim the earliest possible notice of the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to\n\n268\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo233o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023313.tif": "the federal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n NPA], I would have\nobjected.” Wild further stated in her declaration that, “Based on what the FBI had been telling me,\nI thought they were still investigating my case.”\n\nNeither the CEOS Trial Atorney nor the FBI case agent recalled the specifics of the victim\ninterviews. The FBI reports memorializing each interview primarily addressed the facts elicited\nfrom the victim regarding Epstein’s abuse and did not describe any discussion about the status of\nthe case or the victim’s view about the prosecution of Epstein.\n\nWhen asked whether she was concerned that failing to tell victims about the NPA when\nshe was interviewing them would mislead victims, as previously noted, Villafafia told OPR that\nshe believed she and the agents were conducting an investigation because they continued\n“interviewing witnesses” and “doing all these things” to file charges and prepare for a federal trial.\nAs Villafafia stated, “So to me, saying to a victim the case is nou back under investigation is\nperfectly accurate.”\n\nVillafafia was also aware that some victims were represented by counsel in connection with\ncivil lawsuits against Epstein, but did not proactively inform the victims’ atorneys about the NPA.\nIn a 2ol7 affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation, victims’ atorney Bradley Edwards alleged that\nduring telephone calls with Villafafia, he “asked very specific questions about what stage the\ninvestigation was in,” and Villafafia replied that she could not answer his questions because the\nmater “was an on-going active investigation.” Edwards stated that Villafafia gave him “the\nimpression that the Federal investigation was on-going, very expansive, and continuously grouing,\nboth in the number of identified victims and complexity.” Edwards also stated, “A fair\ncharacterization of each call was that I provided information and asked questions and Villafafia\nlistened and expressed that she was unable to say much or answer the questions I was asking.”\n\nIn her writen response to OPR, Villafafia stated that she “listened more than [she] spoke”\nduring her interactions with Edwards and that due to the “uncertainty of the situation” and the\npossibility of a trial, she “did not feel comfortable sharing any information about the case.”\nVillafafia also told OPR that because of “all of these concerns and instructions that I had been\ngiven by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose things further and not to have any\ninvolvement in victim notification,” she felt “prohibited” from providing additional information\nto Edwards.\n\nSloman told OPR that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO\nfrom exercising its discretion to notify the victims, “[I]t was [of] concern that this was going to\nbreak doun and . . . result in us prosecuting Epstein and that the victims were going to be witnesses\nand if we provided a victim notification indicating, hey, you’re going to get $l5o,ooo, that’s .. .\ngoing to be instant impeachment for the defense.”**4 Acosta told OPR that, because Epstein did\n433 As noted above, the FBI agent’s notes for one victim’s interview reported that she wanted another victim to\nbe prosecuted.\n\n434 When asked why the USAO did not simply notify the victims of the change of plea hearing, Sloman\nresponded that he “was more focused on the <span class=\"highlight\">restitution</span> provisions. I didn’t get the sense that the victims were overly\ninterested in shouing up . . . at the change of plea.”\n275\nDOJ-OGR-ooo233l3", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES011/DOJ-OGR-00029018.tif": "»- INTRODUCTION. | AS A CRIME VICTIM, YOU HAVE THE SUPPORT SERVICES\nBy MS Ss oS erg chs som upone geet himerat cure e eeeces ie FOLLOWING RIGHTS under\nOe ters crane ace ct en NG l8 United States Code, Section 377l: Ail states have crime victims compensation programs\neet Rederal.f in bs.» PartOoRMeEBI s Workinvouess: =o o9, @ thes ht ; bl rate, and timely notice of care cests, fost wages and support, and funeral and burial\nPee oproviding infor mationand assistance touigtimsy.
