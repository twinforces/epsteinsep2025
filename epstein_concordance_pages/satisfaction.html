Nathan\nJuly 2l, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nAlthough Ms. Strauss sprinkled her comments with the phrase “as alleged,” she presented\ncertain of her statements as fact.? Regardless, after Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent\nWilliam Sweeney went even further, calling Ms. Maxwell “one of the villains in this\ninvestigation” and compared her to a snake that “slithered away to a gorgeous property in New\nHampshire.” Thus, Mr. Sweeney offers the Government’s, again flatly wrong, opinions about\ncharacter and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a semi-biblical reference involving a snake\nslithering away to a garden in New Hampshire. These types of comments, which serve no\ncompelling law enforcement or investigatory purpose, are prohibited by the local rules of this\nDistrict.\n\nNew York atorney David Boies and his partner Sigrid McCawley, who represent several\nwitnesses in this mater, have also made public and presumptively prejudicial statements in\nrecent days, notwithstanding the fact that such conduct is prohibited by Local Rule 23.l, which\napplies to lawyers practicing in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically.\nSee Rule 23.l(a) and (b).\n\nAs reported by the Washington Post, Mr. Boies expressed his views on the prohibited\nsubject of “the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense” in\nviolation of sections (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:\n\nBoies said he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as\n\nshe looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant prison sentence.\n\nMaxwell could potentially help prosecutors shed light on Epstein’s dealings with\n\nother wealthy and influential people who may have had encounters with\n\nunderaged victims, he said, adding ‘There were a lot of people with a lot of public\n\nstature who were involved with Epstein.”4\nMs. McCawley echoed Mr. Boies, saying that, “The pain [Maxwell] has caused will never go\naway but today is a step touard healing.” /d.\n\nBradley Edwards, another atorney representing witnesses in this mater made similar\npresumptively prejudicial statements follouing Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°\n\n‘The reality of hou this organization worked was that 99.9% of it was\n\norchestrated for Jeffrey Epstein’s personal sexual <span class=\"highlight\">satisfaction</span>.

Based on the nature of the charges, might it be difficult for your to be a fair and\nimpartial juror in this case? [If Yes/Unsure question privately.]\n\nThe Charges\n\nThis is a criminal case. The defendant on trial, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged with\nthe commission of federal crimes in an Indictment filed by a grand jury siting in this District.\n\nThe Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the charges that the Government is\nrequired to prove to the <span class=\"highlight\">satisfaction</span> of the trial jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The charges were\nsummarized in the questionnaire you all filled out. The Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell\nconspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, transported a minor female to engage in criminal sexual activity, and engaged\nin sex trafficking of a minor.\n\nI will summarize the charges again briefly in this case in order to determine whether there\nis anything about the nature of this case that may make it difficult or inappropriate for any of you\nto serve on the jury.\n\nThe Indictment in this case contains six counts or charges:\n\ne Count One of the Indictment charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and\nincluding in or about 2oo4, Ghislaine Maxwell, the defendant, conspired with others to\nentice minors to travel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in sexual activity for\nwhich a person can be charged with a criminal offense.\n\ne Count Two charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and including in or about\nl997, Ghislaine Maxwell enticed a minor to travel in interstate and foreign commerce to\nengage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and\naided and abeted the same.\n\ne Count Three charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and including in or about\n2oo4, Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with others to transport minors in interstate and foreign\ncommerce to engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal\noffense.\n\ne Count Four charges that, from at least in or about l994, up to and including in or about\nl997, Ghislaine Maxwell transported minors in interstate and foreign commerce to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and aided and\nabeted the same.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5362", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page5ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 5\nhindsight, labeled “grooming” or otherwise imputed as knouledge to onlookers.

Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt.

As a\nresult, the jury heard a great deal of testimony from Jane, Kate, and Annie Farmer, as well as\nother evidence, about conduct that took place in Epstein’s residences in New Mexico, London,\nthe U.S. Virgin Islands, and, of course, Florida.
