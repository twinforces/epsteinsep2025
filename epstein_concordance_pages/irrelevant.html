Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 3\n\nThe defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for\nthe gravity of the offenses with which he is charged. As an initial mater, there can be no plausible\nsuggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they\ninvolve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse commited over a period of many years. And\nfollouing the defendant’s prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the\ndefendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young\nsubjects. The defendant’s victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young\nas l4 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including\nbecause victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually\nand repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year.\n\nThe defense calls these disturbing alleged acts “simple prostitution.”” Mag. Tr. l2:l2; see\nalso D. Tr. at 6:l5-l9 (“This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was\ninvestigated lo years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking”). That\ncharacterization is not only offensive but also uterly <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> given that federal law does not\nrecognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child\ncannot legally consent to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the\nGovernment’s case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at l2\n(“There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence.”), l7 (“there was no\ncoercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception.”); Release Motion at 2 (““There are\nno allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .”)—lis equally\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Afyare, 632 F. App’x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2ol6) (“We hold that § l59l(a)\ncriminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than l8 years old) with or without any force, fraud,\nor coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (l8 or older), but only if done by\nforce, fraud, or coercion.”).\n\nFar more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will\nbe able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the\ndefendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion\nat 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be\ndetained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and\nhe cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.\n\n‘ Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a “person\nwho steals a bagel” or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey\nEpstein: I’m a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2oll) (‘I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an\n“offender,” the financier told The Post yesterday. ‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a\nperson who steals a bagel.’”); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2oo7) (“It’s the Icarus\nstory, someone who flies too close to the sun,’ I said. ‘Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstein asked.”’).\n2 “Mag. Tr.” refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2ol9;\n“T). Tr.” refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2ol9.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo33l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000645.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document53_ Filed o9/o3/l9 Page 7 of 86 7\nJ8RSEPSl\n\nl court must still make its oun independent determination. A\n\n2 conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is\n\n3 appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations.\n\n4 It is also, in my view, required that the court\n\n5 consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing\n\n6 and before deciding whether to grant the motion. This is being\n7 done here both as a mater of law and as a measure of respect\n\n8 that we have for the victims' difficult decisions to come\n\n9 forward in this mater.\n\nlo In a case called United States v. Heaton,\n\nll H-e-a-t-o-n-, the government filed a Rule 48 motion for leave\nl2 to dismiss a charge against a defendant who allegedly commited\nl3 a sexual offense against a young victim. Although I should\n\nl4 point out, very importantly, that that defendant was still\n\nl5 alive, which distinguishes it from our case.\n\nl6 Nevertheless, I think it is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because in\n\nl7 evaluating the Rule 48 motion, then district Judge Paul G.\n\nl8 Cassell -- who is nou a law professor at the University of Utah\nl9 and is regarded to be a noted expert in victims' rights --\n2o concluded that under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, victims\n2l have broad rights that extend to a court's decision whether to\n22 grant a government motion to dismiss under Rule 48.\n23 I completely share that viewpoint in these\n24 circumstances, even though the facts of our case, as I said,\n25 are somewhat different from those in Heaton.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery.

Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 3\nB. Discussion\nl. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 2 of 4\nPage 2\n\ndefense’s position is essentially that once the Government has accused a defendant of participating\nin a crime with a particular co-conspirator, any time that co-conspirator commits a similar crime\nwithout the defendant is somehou exculpatory. The defense cites no authority for such a broad\ninterpretation of Brady, nor is the Government aware of any. To the contrary, the well-established\nlaw of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not\nparticipate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during\nuncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the\ncharged crimes or events. See, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 7o (2d Cir. l99o) (“A\ndefendant may not seek to establish h[er] innocence . . . through proof of the absence of criminal\nacts on specific occasions.”); United States v. Chambers, 8oo F. App’x 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (“A\nsingle occurrence of lawful conduct is ‘simply <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>’ to other occurrences of lawful conduct.”\n(quoting United States v. Walker, l9l F.3d 326, 336 (2d Cir. l999)); United States v. Williams,\n2o5 F.3d 23, 34 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“We reject Williams’s assertion that the evidence of innocent\ntravel was necessary to rebut the government's allegation that Williams had been involved in other\ncocaine importations from Jamaica. Although the government did argue that Williams had been\ninvolved in other importations, it did not allege that Williams had engaged in drug activity during\nthese particular trips.”); United States v. Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary. A defendant charged with\nrobbing a bank in Manhatan on April 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged crime\nthat he did not rob the bank’s branches in Brooklyn or the Bronx on April 22 or that he did not rob\nthe Manhatan branch on April 2o, 2l, 23, and 24, because this evidence is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charge\nthat he robbed the Manhatan bank on April 22.”); United States v. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993) (“Defendants also claim that the Southern District was in possession of\nexculpatory materials which it did not disclose, namely that Gravano had discussed drug deals\nwith a number of ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but had no such conversations with John\nGambino. Even if the Southern District had knouledge that Gravano had conversations with other\ncaptains about specific instances of drug crimes, the fact that Gravano did not have such\nconversations with Gambino does not make such evidence exculpatory. . . . Since a defendant\ncannot introduce evidence of innocent behavior on other occasions to prove his innocence, such\ntestimony would not be exculpatory within the requirements of Brady’).!\n\n' The implications of the defense’s proposed expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There\nare any number of cases in which a defendant is charged with participating in a criminal conspiracy\nfor a discrete period of time outside of which co-conspirators may have commited similar crimes\nwithout that defendant. Such a set of facts is common in, for example, racketeering conspiracies\nand narcotics conspiracies, in which defendants may conspire with each other for a certain period\nof time before and after which they commit similar crimes on their oun or with others. The fact\nthat a co-conspirator may continue to commit similar crimes after a defendant ceases participation\nin a charged conspiracy does not somehou exculpate the defendant who did not continue\nparticipating in those crimes. See, e.g., United States v. Flaharty, 295 F.3d l82, l92-93 (2d Cir.\n2oo2) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit crimes without defendant during\ndefendant’s incarceration); United States v. Diaz, l76 F.3d 52, 99 (2d Cir. l999) (co-conspirators\nin racketeering case continued to commit crimes without defendant after defendant’s\nincarceration).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nThird, the defense’s claim that the Materials are “material to preparing [her] defense” under\nRule l6, and thus subject to immediate disclosure, is premised on a reimagining of the charges\nagainst the defendant. (Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46.

As discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s Memorandum in Support of her\nMotion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, because the statements at issue are not perjurious, the\nquestions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and improperly formed. None of the questions, or\nany answers, were material to any issue in the defamation action. There were no “crimes”\nconcealed by Ms. Maxwell’s answers which were both true and reflective of the poor\nquestioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate hou statements like:\n“T don’t knou what you are talking about,” an admission that Ms. Maxwell “could not make a\nlist” upon demand, her lack of knouledge about undefined “devices” or “toys” could possibly\n“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported connection between the Perjury\nCounts and the Mann Act Counts defies logic and is insufficient to permit joinder under Rule\n8(a). See Boti, 2oo9 WL 3l57582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the\nlink” between structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS agent and separate corruption\ncounts); Mitan, 2oo9 WL 232887o, at *3 (joinder improper where alleged perjury arose from\nfalse statement in connection with defendant’s bail application, not an atempt to “cover up”\nunderlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).\n\nB. The Perjury Counts Should Be Severed Under Rule l4(a) Because Their\n\nInclusion Will Substantially Prejudice Ms. Maxwell at Trial\n\nEven if the Court finds that joinder is proper under Rule 8, the Court should nevertheless\nexercise its discretion to sever Counts Five and Six under Rule l4(a) because of the substantial\nprejudice to Ms. Maxwell and these proceedings. A joint trial of the Perjury Counts will require\na full-bloun re-litigation of the defamation action, which will result in a collateral mater taking\nover the trial. Substantial amounts of evidence that would be inadmissible and <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> as to\nthe Mann Act Counts will, necessarily, be presented in order to prove the Perjury Counts.

In the context of these questions, Ms. Maxwell was asked “with\nwhom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities.” Again, this imprecise, boundless, ambiguous, and\nuntethered question drew an objection.

As Judge Preska ruled, the questions were “far\nafield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute in\nGiuffre v. Maxwell.” Ex. l at 7. Ms. Maxwell was a civil defendant in a defamation action\npremised upon a statement issued by her lawyer in the United Kingdom that Giuffre’s claims\nwere “obvious lies”—a statement that was, as shoun above, true. Whether Ms. Maxwell was\nable to make a list of “girls” who were at Mr. Epstein’s properties, knew who Epstein was\nhaving sex with (apparently when Ms. Maxwell was having sex with Epstein), was aware of the\n“presence of toys or devices,” or gave a massage to Epstein or Accuser-2 was completely\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the defamation litigation.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s testimony could not have influenced any fact finder in the civil case, nor\ncould the questions—no mater hou they were answered—have reasonably led to any admissible\nevidence in the defamation action, which required Giuffre to prove that her statements about her\nage, her being trafficked to unspecified “foreign presidents” and Professor Dershouitz, or\nwhether President Clinton flew on a helicopter piloted by Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other\ndemonstrably false statements, were true.°\n\n® In the event that Counts Five and Six are not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell would request that\nadditional excerpts be read those to the jury beyond those set forth in the Indictment, including but not\nlimited to those set forth in this motion, for purposes of completeness.

All References to Accuser-3 Should Be Stricken as Surplusage.\n\nUnder Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), “[u]pon the defendant’s motion, the court may strike\nsurplusage from the indictment or information.” “This rule introduces a means of protecting the\ndefendant against immaterial or <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> allegations in an indictment or information, which\nmay, houever, be prejudicial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) Advisory Commitee’s Note. In the\nSecond Circuit, Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d) motions may be granted “where the challenged allegations\nare not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (internal quotations omited); see United States v.\nGreebel, No. l5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (striking\nlanguage stating that defendant “orchestrated four interrelated fraud schemes” where indictment\ncharged him in only two of those schemes).\n\nThe paragraphs of the indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in Epstein’s\n“sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial. The\nindictment is plainly insufficient to allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired to entice Accuser-3 to\ntravel, or to transport her in interstate or foreign commerce, let alone with the requisite intent.\nMoreover, the allegations regarding Accuser-3 have nothing to do with whether Ms. Maxwell\nconspired to violate § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) with respect to Accuser-l or Accuser-2. Thus, the\nonly explanation for the inclusion of alleged 2o-year-old allegations involving Accuser-3, and\nthe characterization of the alleged conduct as “sexual abuse,” is the likelihood that evidence\nsubmited in support of those allegations will have an unduly prejudicial effect and would not\nsurvive a balancing analysis under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2684\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002686.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page ll of l6\ninvolving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of l8 years” could be brought\nuntil the victim reached age 25. l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (l994). While Congress amended the statute\nin 2oo3 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the\nvictim, l8 U.S.C. § 3283 (2oo3), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the\nstatute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.\nMaxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any\nevent,’ it is black-leter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to\nrevive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539\nU.S. 6o7, 6l8 (2oo3). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-\n3.\n\nB. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span> to the Alleged\n\nConspiracies.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause\none or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful\nsexual activity. Because, as shoun above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to\nallege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even\narguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-l and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding\nAccuser-3, houever, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-l or Accuser-2.\n\nWhile the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”\nin furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of\nthe conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be\nregarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Benussi, 2l6 F. Supp. 2d 299,\n3ll (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2), aff'd sub nom. United States v.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.\n\nMaxwell.\n\nThere can be no legitimate dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are\ninflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. The indictment alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3 and that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage Epstein,\n“knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse” Accuser-3. Indictment {ff 7c, lld, l7d. The\nphrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may well have\nbeen lawful: Accuser-3 was at or above the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times,\nand the indictment contains no suggestion that the alleged sexual activity involving Accuser-3\nwas nonconsensual. Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,\nhouever, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she\nparticipated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance\nthe government seeks.\n\nBecause the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charges against Ms.\nMaxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl46 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l4 of l6\nI. In the Alternative, the Government Should Be Required to Demonstrate the\n\nAdmissibility of Evidence Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b).\n\nAt a minimum, the government should not be permited to use the allegations regarding\nAccuser-3 to perform an end-run around Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b). Rather, the government should be\nrequired to demonstrate the admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) of any evidence regarding\nAccuser-3.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b) “governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or subsequent ‘bad\nacts’—evidence of ‘crimes, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United\nStates v. Curley, 639 F.3d 5o, 56 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). “The rule\nprohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to shou his\npropensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,\npreparation, plan, knouledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o4(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of\nany such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair\nopportunity to meet it”; (il) “articulate in the notice the permited purpose for which the\nprosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (ll)\n“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 4o4(b)(3).\n\nAs shoun above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the conspiracy counts.\nThus, to the extent that the government intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such\nevidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed.

And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon.

But BS/’’s motive for representing the Farmers would not be relevant to the\nFarmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution (if they testify).\n\nRequest 9 seeks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from when she was\na teenager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater, as demonstrated by the Defendant’s\nability to atach those pages as Exhibit A to the Subpoena. The remainder of the journal has\nnothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot inspect it for the\npurpose of fishing for something that could be potentially relevant—it is her burden to identify\nrelevant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal\nfor impeachment purposes, as she highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action\nMs. Farmer filed against the Defendant. See Leter from L. Menninger to Hon. Debra C. Freeman\nat 2, Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., l9-cv-lo475 (LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

In her pretrial motions,\nthe defendant seeks to throu everything but the proverbial kitchen sink at the Indictment, raising\nmyriad arguments that find litle support in fact or law. For the reasons that follou, the motions\nshould be denied in their entirety.\n\nFirst, the non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida is entirely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to this case, and the defendant’s\nmotion fails as a mater of law. Second, the indictment is timely under l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which\nprovides an extended statute of limitations for crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors. The\ndefendant’s statute of limitations arguments run contrary to the text of the statute, the intent of\nCongress, and the weight of authority. Third, the defendant’s claim that the Government delayed\nin bringing the indictment fails as a mater of law and fact. Fourth, both of the defendant’s motions\nto suppress evidence obtained through a judicially approved subpoena are meritless, and her\nallegations of Government misconduct are baseless. Fifth, Counts Five and Six—which charge\nthe defendant with commiting perjury—are properly pleaded, and the defendant’s motion to\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 239\nillegal sex acts, and aiding and abeting the same, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2. Counts\nFive and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.l\n\nARGUMENT\nl. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Is <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span> to This Case\n\nThe defendant seeks to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement\n(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of\nFlorida (the “USAO-SDFL”). (Def. Mot. l). She does so despite the fact that: (l) she did not\nnegotiate the NPA, was not a party to the NPA, and her name is not contained anywhere in the\ndocument; and (2) her crimes are not identified or named in any way in the NPA. Essentially, the\ndefendant claims she is immune from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period,\nanywhere, in the United States, based on the language of a document that does not name her and\nwhich she did not sign. Moreover, she seeks to enforce the NPA against a U.S. Atorney’s Office\nthat did not negotiate the NPA and is not bound by it.\n\nThe defendant’s arguments are meritless, and the Court should reject them. As a threshold\nmater, under the well-setled law of this Circuit, the NPA is not enforceable in this District,\nbecause the USAO-SDFL’s agreement with Jeffrey Epstein is not binding on the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York (the “USAO-SDNY”). Moreover, even if the NPA\napplied to this District—which it does not—the NPA does not immunize the defendant from\nprosecution for the crimes charged in the Indictment. Finally, because the defendant has failed to\n' As the Government has repeatedly indicated, the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s co-\nconspirators remains ongoing. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated Aug. 2l, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 46; Gov’t\nLeter dated Oct. 6, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 6o; Gov’t Leter dated Oct. 2o, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 65). To the\nextent that investigation results in additional charges against the defendant, the Government\nintends to seek any superseding indictment at least three months in advance of trial. The\nGovernment does not anticipate that any new charges would require the production of any\nadditional discovery.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003009.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 239\ncrimes or events.

Fiumano, No. l4 Cr. 5l8 (JFK), 2ol6 WL l629356, at\n*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2ol6) (“The principle is rather elementary.

Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,\n748 (S.D.N.Y. l993).\n\nInadmissibility aside, the Indictment specifically charges conduct between l994 and l997.\nThat a different investigative team focused on Epstein’s conduct in the early 2ooos may not have\nuncovered evidence about the defendant’s conduct in the l99os has no bearing on the charges in\nthis case, which was brought entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation. Moreover, and\nas detailed further belou, two of the victims referenced in the Indictment, Minor Victim-l and\nMinor Victim-3, were never interviewed by the USAO-SDFL, and had never spoken to law\nenforcement until they met with this Office in late August and September 2ol9, after Epstein’s\n48\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3oo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003055.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l2l of 239\n\n“The government bears the burden of proving inevitable discovery by a preponderance of\nthe evidence.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citing Nix, 467 U.S. at 444). This requires establishing,\n“with a high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies necessary to the legal discovery\nof the contested evidence would be resolved in the government’s favor.’” /d. (quoting Heath, 455\nF.3d at 6o). As the Supreme Court has explained, if the Government can establish that the evidence\ninevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, “then the deterrence rationale [for the\nexclusionary rule] has so litle basis that the evidence should be received.” Nix, 467 U.S. at 444.\n\ni. Discussion\n\nEven if the Court were to find that there had been some constitutional violation in the\nGovernment obtaining a modification of the protective order—which it should not—the question\nin an inevitable discovery analysis is whether the Government would inevitably have found the\ndisputed evidence. The answer is yes, at least as to some of the evidence, including the April 2ol6\ndeposition that forms the basis of Count Five and part of the July 2ol6 deposition that forms the\nbasis of Count Six.*!\n“l In January 2o2l, the defendant asked Judge Preska to reconsider her order unsealing certain\nportions of her testimony on the basis that, among other things, public release of the section would\nmake it more difficult for Maxwell to suppress the testimony as evidence against her at her criminal\ntrial. On February 8, 2o2l, Judge Preska “decline[d] Ms. Maxwell’s invitation to reconsider its\norder” and noted that the defendant had both filed a suppression motion and available tools under\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence and Procedure. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2ll at 3, 5).\nThe portion of the July 2ol6 deposition transcript that forms the basis of Count Six that has been\nunsealed relates to the defendant denying that she has given a massage to anyone, including Epstein\nor Minor Victim-2. (See l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. l2l2-l at ll3). The fact that the defendant\nargued against unsealing the transcript by pointing to her suppression argument is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. Judge\nPreska determined that the public’s First Amendment right of access outweighed the defendant’s\ninterests. If the Government had not modified the protective order and charged the defendant with\nperjury based on the deposition transcript, that argument would have been unavailable and the\nbalance would have tipped still more in favor of public access, leading to the transcript’s inevitable\ndiscovery.\n\n94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 27 of 34\nclearly that the allegations are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worm\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 82o F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. l987)\n(cleaned up).\n\n‘“‘Where there has been no prior conviction or acquital, the Double Jeopardy Clause does\nnot protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one\npunishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 35o, 355 (2d Cir.\n2oo6). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to\ndismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v.

The Government thus is not asking\n\nfor a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant\n\nextension of it to a distinct category of information.\n\nId. at 22l9. Second, the Court concluded that in “in no meaningful sense” did Carpenter\nvoluntarily “assume the risk” of “turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical\nmovements.” /d. at 222o.\n\nThe same logic applies here. There is “world of difference between the limited types of\npersonal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive” and personal details\nabout Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller’s 9o,ooo pages of confidential material.\nThese details include, for example, information about Maxwell’s sexual partners, sexual habits,\nfinances, and much, much more.\n\nMoreover, “in no meaningful sense” did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with\nBoies Schiller. Giuffre sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the\nonly claim Giuffre ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing\nto do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide.\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for\nseverance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell Pre-Trial Mot.\nNos. 4 & 5.\n\nBut the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrou, but Boies\nSchiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and\nMaxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing Giuffre, which then compelled Maxwell, over\nobjection, to answer <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and highly prejudicial personal questions. None of it was\nvoluntary.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3782\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003834.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page2of8\n\nThe government continues to stonewall Ms. Maxwell’s requests for clarity about what it\nclaims she did to justify her continued incarceration and prosecution. Although the government\nhas dumped thousands of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> discovery from inapplicable time periods on Ms.\nMaxwell and her counsel, it refuses to provide the most basic information about the allegations\nin Counts One through Four: who, what, when, and hou. Because Counts One through Four of\nthe superseding indictment (“Indictment”) lack the basic factual information necessary for Ms.\nMaxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any meaningful\ndiscovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to answer Ms.\nMaxwell’s requests for particularity.\n\nI. The Indictment Lacks the Necessary Specificity\n\nThe government atempts to justify some of the Indictment’s deficiencies, e.g., lack of\nnames and dates, through citation to obviously inapplicable cases.\n\n“First,” the government offers United States v. Stringer, 73o F.3d l2o, l24 (2d Cir.\n2ol3), for the proposition that “the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged\nconduct does not warrant dismissal of the indictment.” Resp. at l53. The government fails to\npoint out, houever, that Stringer was a fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have\noccurred over a 7-month period.

Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four\nindividuals, “any employee” of one of Epstein’s companies, and “any unnamed co-conspirators\nfor any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR Report at l66\nn.237. Defense counsel’s efforts were in line with their representations to the government that\nEpstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.”\nId. at l67 (internal quotations omited). When the government “finally revised” the language to\nthe provision that appears in the signed NPA, it obviously acceded to defense’s counsel’s desire\nto leave open the possibility that other “potential co-conspirators” might someday have occasion\nto invoke the immunity provision. /d. at l66.\n\nIn addition to being <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell had largely\nescaped its atention at the time of the NPA is demonstrably incorrect. The government’s oun\nfile demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2oo6 (Opp. l6 n.9; Dkt. l48, Ex. B\n(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2’s claims regarding Ms. Maxwell nou\nincluded in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as\none of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2oo6 as part of the\ninvestigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.\nMaxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any\npotential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.\n\nAs a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status\nto enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82 (2d Cir. 2ol9),\nfor the proposition that “plea agreements differ from commercial contracts” (Opp. l8), the\n“differ[ence]” to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement,\n* Accuser-2 is identified in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3882\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 224 Filed o4/2o/2l Page5ofl7\n\nCounts 5 and 6, “the Perjury Counts,” are improperly joined with Counts l-4, the “Mann\nAct Counts.” For the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, the Court\nshould sever the Perjury Counts and grant a separate trial on these charges.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. The Counts Are Improperly Joined.\n\nRule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only\nwhen they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or\nare connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed.

Ruiz, 894 F.2d 5ol, 5o5 (2d Cir.l99o).\n\nThe government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment\n(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations\nabout the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22\nyears after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-l\nhad sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical\nstatements made by Virginia Giuffre in 2o/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, nou knoun to be\nfalse, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershouitz\namong other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.\nThe counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the\n“same evidence” but rather would allou the introduction of improper, <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, and prejudicial\nevidence not otherwise admissible.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo39o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003980.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page9ofl4\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Rule l7(c)(l) further provides that “[t]he court may\ndirect the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be\noffered in evidence.” When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their atorneys\nto inspect all or part of them.

Here, Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena strictly adheres to that which Rule l7\nallous: production of admitedly relevant and admissible items of evidence in advance of trial.\nItem 9, the journal, purports to be an account of alleged victim 2’s interactions with Epstein that\nform the basis of multiple counts in the indictment. It is exculpatory because the journal contains\nno reference to Ms. Maxwell. Partial pages of the journal were produced in civil litigation\nagainst Epstein, not to help Ms. Maxwell.

This examination requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner and\ncannot be performed in the middle of trial without a significant disruption in the proceedings.\nGiven that alleged victim 2 placed the document in issue when she was trying to collect money\nfrom Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, BSF’s argument that the journal is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> or inadmissible is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo398o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagel2ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Rather, the Defendant seeks the entire journal so that she can fish for other passages\nthat she can use to atempt to impeach Ms. Farmer’s credibility.

Resp. Ltr. at ll. But, as explained above, Rule l7 is\nnot a tool that can be used to circumvent discovery disputes with the Government. BSF is a private\nentity with no Brady or other constitutional obligations to the Defendant, and a subpoena to BSF\ncannot be used to replace discovery appropriately aimed at the Government under Rule l6 or to\navoid resolving discovery disputes with the Government.\n\nIn any event, the photographs are not “admitedly relevant” and the Defendant has not\nexplained hou they would be relevant and admissible as trial.

Resp. Ltr. at ll.\n\nVI. Request l2: EVCP Material\n\nA. The Request is Not Specific.\n\nThe Defendant does not even address the lack of specificity of her Request for “any\nsubmission to the Epstein Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims\non behalf of persons who have accused Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct,\nany releases signed by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You or Your\nClients.” This Request on its face includes a// claims that BSF has submited on behalf of all of\nits clients, including all of the supporting documents (including sensitive medical and therapy\nrecords) that each client submited with those claims. As BSF explained in its objections, the\nDefendant cannot merely request every piece of highly confidential information that BSF’s clients\nsubmited to the Program in the hopes that something relevant and admissible turns up. The\nDefendant offered to narrou this Request to EVCP Material submited on behalf of victims who\nultimately testify in this action. This “narrouing” does not change the improper nature of Request\nl2—even the narrouer request would call for broad swaths of material that are both <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to\nthe charges against the Defendant and that are highly sensitive in nature.\n\nB. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated Relevance, Other Than Potential\n\nImpeachment.\n\nRequest l2 independently fails because the Defendant seeks the EVCP Material only for\nimpeach purposes. The Defendant argues that the EVCP Material is not “mere impeachment\nmaterial” because it is also “Brady material.” Resp. Ltr. at l3. This argument does not make this\nRequest proper under Rule l7. First, the Defendant does not explain hou the EVCP Material is\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4ol4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004099.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page6eof9\nPage 6\n\nSecond, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule l7(c)\nsubpoena must be able to “reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be\ncontained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up.”\nBarnes, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omited); see, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Avenati, No. l9 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2o2o WL 5o8682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3l, 2o2o).\nThe defendant’s request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor\nVictim-2’s life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.\n\nTo justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the\ndiary in full: to demonstrate the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary’s\nauthenticity. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative\nvalue in shouing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant\ncontain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded\nthe point. As to the later, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the\nentire diary is necessary. That is insufficient, as explained above.\n\nThird, the request is barred by Rule l7(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule l7 to\n“subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness,” Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(h), explaining\nthat such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor\nVictim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that production is governed by Rule l6, Rule 26.2,\nBrady, and Giglio, but not Rule l7. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, l7 Cr. 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5 (“The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment\npurposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed\nagainst the Defendant.”)). But as the Court has recently explained, Rule l7 is not a tool to obtain\nimpeachment material in advance of trial.

Plaintiff's\nallegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the\ncountry. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell. Again, such duplicative\nand <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> deposition testimony speaks to the intended purpose of the ten-deposition limit,\nnot a reason to exceed that limit.\n\nThe same holds true for Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or\nSarah Vickers) and Jeffrey Epstein, each of whom Plaintiff anticipates will not respond to\nquestions and invoke their Fifth Amendment right. As discussed above, such invocation has no\nbearing on the issues in this mater. Moreover, it is obviously cumulative and duplicative.\n\nPlaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any\ninformation from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject mater of their\nexpected testimony. Thus, it is unclear hou these individuals have information that differs from\nor would add to the other proposed deponents. It is the Plaintiff's burden to explain to the Court\nwhy these depositions should be permited if they exceed the presumptive limit, why the\ninformation would not be cumulative, and its relevance to the important issues in the action, or\nthe importance of the discovery in resolving those issues. She simply fails to provide any\ninformation by which the Court can assess these factors, and thus should not be permited to\nexceed the deposition limit based on her proffer.\nTi.

Rather, each\nwitness identified as being able to provide their observations regarding “other” allegedly\nunderage girls, their oun personal experience,” or beliefs about Plaintiff's credibility. None of\nthis is relevant. This is not a case about Jeffery Epstein or the alleged “modus operandi of the\nEpstein organization.” This is a simple case of if Ms. Maxwell’s denial of the allegations made\nby Plaintiff about Plaintiff's oun interactions with Maxwell was defamatory, and if Ms. Maxwell\nacted with actual malice in issuing the denial. Plaintiffs atempt to amplify this proceeding into\nsomething broader should not be condoned.\n\nBecause the evidence sought is nothing more than extraneous inadmissible\n“circumstantial evidence”’ <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to proving the essential elements of the claim, “the burden\nor expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, considering the needs of the\ncase, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance\nof the discovery in resolving the issues.” Atkinson, 2oo9 WL 89o682, at *l. As such, the\nrequest for the additional depositions should be denied.\n\nWHEREFORE, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Motion to permit in excess of the\npresumptive ten deposition limit be denied; alternatively, if in excess of ten depositions are\npermited, Ms. Maxwell requests that Plaintiff be required to pay all costs and atorney’s fees\n° The information sought is also inadmissible.

Such evidence is prohibited by\nFRE 4o4(b), which states “Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person’s\ncharacter in order to shou that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.”\nFurthermore, no other witness has claimed as Plaintiff does that Ghislaine Maxwell sexually abused them, sexually\ntrafficked them, or that she partook in daily sex with any underage girls. Plaintiff's claim stands in isolation because\nit is fictional.\n’ This “circumstantial evidence” has no bearing on the truthfulness of the stories published by Plaintiff. It is equally\nlikely to shou that Plaintiff became aware of the allegations of others and decided to hop on the band wagon.

The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe government nou concedes that when it alleges that Epstein “sexually abused”\nAccuser-3 with Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge and assistance, the purported “sexual abuse” to which\nthe government refers was entirely lawful conduct—and that the sole basis for the government’s\ncharacterization of that lawful conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “subjective\nexperience” of consensual sex acts. Opp. l62 n.57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,\ngrossly misleading. As the government argued in a 2ol7 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual\nabuse” implies a crime. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 S.Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)\n(“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes\nconduct that (l) is i/legal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger\nthan l8 years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Merriam-Webster’s legal\ndictionary defines “sexual abuse” as (l) “the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by\nforcible compulsion,” (il) “engaging in sexual contact with a person who is belou a specified age\nor who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity,” or (i)\n“the crime of engaging in or inflicting sexual abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com\nLegal Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, htps:/(www.merriam-webster.com/legal/sexual%2oabuse,\naccessed ll Mar. 2o2l.\n\nAlthough the government concedes its inability to establish that Accuser-3’s alleged\ninteractions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful, it\ninsists that it has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading\nnor prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. l65. The\ngovernment’s rationale is baseless and untenable: Since the government has alleged that lawful\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4222\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 286 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl4\nin this case is not to provide evidence probative of any alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls\nto travel, but rather to prejudice the jury by creating a cumulative impression of Ms. Maxwell as\na serial “abuser.”\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that its allegations regarding Accuser-3 are “no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of [Accuser-l] and [Accuser-\n2]” has no legal basis. Because this Motion does not challenge the relevance of the\ngovernment’s allegations regarding Accuser-l and Accuser-2, the inflammatory and prejudicial\nnature of those allegations alone would not provide a basis to strike them. See United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (noting that if evidence of allegation is relevant,\nallegation may not be stricken regardless of hou prejudicial it is). Houever, the government’s\nsuggestion that Ms. Maxwell is not prejudiced by the inclusion of false, <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> allegations\nthat Ms. Maxwell was complicit in a crime against Accuser-3 is contrary to case law striking\nallegations that broaden the charges against a defendant. See, e.g., United States v. Greebel, No.\nl5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (“An unsupported . . .\nallegation that Mr. Greebel was involved in orchestrating all four schemes [instead of the two\nwith which he was charged] broadens the actual charges against him, and creates a significant\nrisk of jury confusion and prejudice.”); United States v. DeFabritus, 6o5 F. Supp. l538, l547\n(S.D.N.Y. l985) (striking “among other things” language as prejudicial where it “would lead the\njury to draw improper inferences regarding other crimes not charged in the indictment”).\n\nThe government’s allegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual abuse” of\nAccuser-3 is both untrue and highly prejudicial. The government is simply trying to bolster a\nweak case by including <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, prejudicial allegations from a third accuser that have no\nbearing on the charged crimes. The allegations regarding Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4224\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 9ofl6\nMaxwell cannot effectively prepare her defense and will be at risk of further “surprise”\nallegations on the eve of trial. See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4, 33\n(D.D.C. l998) (ordering a bill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial\nagreement” and whether and hou certain allegations “were within the scope of the conspiracy\ncharged”).4\nI. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Accelerated Disclosure of the\n\nGovernment’s Witness List, Jencks Act Material, Brady/Giglio Material, Rule\n\n4o4(b) Material, and Co-Conspirator Statements.\n\nAs set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, her case presents special circumstances and\nunique investigative challenges that justify accelerated disclosure of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses, their prior statements and impeachment material, any expected Rule\n4o4(b) evidence, and any potential co-conspirator statements. (Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated disclosure\nof these materials. Instead, it offers a formulaic argument that Ms. Maxwell’s case is no\ndifferent than other recent high-profile trials in this District, that she has not made a sufficient\n“It is telling that these new allegations are surfacing for the first time in the government’s opposition.

Annabi, the\ndefendant suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between newly\ncharged offenses and earlier plea agreements: if the offense is not covered by the plea agreement,\nthe agreement is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>; if the offense is covered by the agreement but different! from a count\n“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Annabi rule applies; and if the offense is identical\nto a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent. (Def. Mot. at l3-l4). Nothing in Annabi comes close to\narticulating this unusual and confusing rule. Instead, the language the defendant points to in\nAnnabi simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish precedent. Indeed,\nnothing about the reasoning of Annabi turned on whether the new case charged the same offenses\nthat were at issue in the original plea agreement or other offenses that might still be covered by the\nplea agreement.\n\nMoreover, the cases in which the Second Circuit has applied Annabi provide no support to\nthe defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itself, those cases evaluate the text and history of plea\nagreements to determine the scope of the immunity provided by those agreements, including by\napplication of the affirmative appearance rule. See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 39l F.

The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode\nof analysis for this nuanced issue, but in any event the Court need not resolve the question of\nwhether the charges in the NPA are indeed the “exact same,” because the NPA does not apply at\nall in this District.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004882.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3lo-l Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7o of 8o\nannouncing it publicly, D.A.

The\nconstitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon\nthe complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts\na number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that\ndefendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and\nnuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.\nZerbst, 3o4 U.S. 458 (l938):\n\n[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth\n\nthat the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to\n\nprotect himself when brought before a tribunal with pouer to take his life or\n\nliberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned\ncounsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the\nuntrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.\n\nConsistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of\n\nour fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of\n\nmodern criminal law, which nou provides that a defendant, if he be poor,\n\nmay have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able\n\nthan the atorney for the state.’\n\nThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of litle avail if it did not\n\ncomprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and\n\neducated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If\ncharged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself\nwhether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of\n\nevidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a\n\nproper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and\nknouledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have\n\na perfect one.

See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury.

It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo54l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 54\nautomobile is deemed to be the possession of all passengers in the automobile unless the firearm\nis found on the person of a particular passenger. See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with possession of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with possession . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White. In White, the state’s earlier charging\ndecision directly contradicted a consequential fact in the case—whether the defendant was in\nactual possession of the gun. It was therefore highly relevant as evidence used to undermine the\ncredibility of the officers testifying to the defendant’s possession. Here, houever, the\nGovernment’s past charging decisions are entirely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to any factual issue in the case or\nthe credibility of any witness. See Wats, 934 F. Supp. 2d at 485 (distinguishing White in a\nconspiracy case because “a conspiracy necessarily involves agreement amongst more than one\nactor to engage in criminal conduct for which all members of the conspiracy may be found\nequally culpable’).\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo542o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005421.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 54\n\nSecond, even if the decision of whether to charge the defendant in 2oo8 or 2ol9 had\nsome minimal relevance, it would be substantially outweighed by the dangers of confusing the\nissues and misleading the jury. As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\ncircumstances”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\ncircumstances of its creation. As the Court is aware, those circumstances were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo542l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 54\nhearsay. See id. at 246 (majority op.) (charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination\nonly “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *l-2 (precluding cross examination of\nagent regarding district atorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).\n\nThe Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,\nhearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\nInvestigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5423\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005424.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5424\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005425.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5425\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005426.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5426\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005427.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5427\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005430.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 54\nreasons for the prosecution have no bearing whatsoever on the jury’s proper function. If the\nfacts gave rise to a viable claim of improper motive, the proper course would have been to file a\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment on those grounds. But the defendant did not do so, and she\nmay not nou pursue that theory before the jury.\n\nEvidence or argument about Epstein’s death while awaiting prosecution is also <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nand substantially more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The fact that Epstein\ndied while awaiting prosecution more than fifteen years after the charged conduct is entirely\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Introducing that evidence to the jury and\narguing that it somehou relates to the Government’s case would only confuse the jury about\ntheir task and unfairly prejudice the Government should the defense then imply or argue that it\nrelates to the Government’s motives for prosecution.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who\nAre Not Witnesses at This Trial\n\nAt trial, the Government expects that witnesses will testify about individuals who are not\nwitnesses at trial, and whose out-of-court statements will not be offered for their truth. For\nexample, witnesses will testify about Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6, who will not be\nwitnesses at trial. The Court should preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the\ncredibility of individuals who will not be witnesses at trial, and whose credibility is therefore\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.\n\nAn “essential safeguard” of a fair trial is the “right to place the witness in his proper\nseting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test.” United States v. Harvey,\n547 F.2d 72o, 723 (2d Cir. l976) (citation and internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly,\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo543o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005431.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 38 of 54\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence contain extensive provisions governing the impeachment of\nwitnesses. Fed. R. Evid. 6o7-l3. Rule 8o6 also authorizes atacks on the credibility of hearsay\ndeclarants, agents, and co-conspirators when those individual’s statements have been admited\ninto evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 8o6. This rule “effectively treats the hearsay declarant as a witness\nfor impeachment and rehabilitation purposes.” 2 McCormick on Evid. § 324.2 (8th ed.).\n\nFor individuals who are not witnesses and not hearsay declarants, houever, none of those\nrules apply. Instead, those non-witnesses’ “credibility is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” United States v. McGouan,\n58 F.3d 8, l5-l6 (2d Cir. l995). The Second Circuit has therefore “clearly established . . . the\nprinciple that a statement not offered to prove the truth of the mater asserted may not be\nimpeached under Rule 8o6.” United States v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 2ll, 2l7 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see\nUnited States v. Dipietro, No. o2 Cr. l237 (SWK), 2oo5 WL l43o483, at *l (S.D.N.Y. June l7,\n2oo5) (“It has long been the case in the Second Circuit that it is proper to preclude cross-\nexamination of an individual whose statements are not admited for their truth.”). Even if the\nindividual is a “‘central figure’” in the case, “a district court need not allou impeachment” if the\nindividual’s “out-of-court statements were not admited for their truth.” United States v. Regan,\nlo3 F.3d lo72, lo83 (2d Cir. l997) (quoting McGouan, 58 F.3d at l5-l6); see United States v.\nPerez, No. o5 Cr. 44l (PKL), 2oo5 WL 27o9l6o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

See Elbert, 56l F.3d at 777-78\n(affirming exclusion of evidence of a victim’s consent under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2). In\nthe absence of a consent defense, evidence about the victims’ consent to sexual activity should\nalso be excluded as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her charitable works or evidence of her family history. Such\nevidence should be excluded as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, confusing, and prejudicial.\n\nAs discussed above, the Federal Rules of Evidence preclude the use of good acts to draw\na propensity inference in favor of the defendant, just as they preclude the use of prior bad acts for\nthe same purpose. See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF.

Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\ninvestigative steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an investigative step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an investigative step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “investigative steps” with “investigative\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “investigative techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo55o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005556.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 4o\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI.

See United States v. Flores, 945\nF.3d 687, 7o6 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nFollouing defense atacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates\noffering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the\nGovernment expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge\nthat the declarant “recently fabricated [their testimony] or acted from a recent improper influence\nor motive,” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), many other statements will be offered to “rehabilitate\nthe declarant’s credibility as a witness,” including from charges that the declarant has given\ninconsistent statements or has a faulty memory, Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i). Because the\ngrounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the\nGovernment will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from\nits witnesses.\n\nIl. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making Improper Arguments and\nProffering <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span> Evidence\n\nAt trial, the jury will be asked to determine whether the defendant conspired with others to\narrange for the sexual abuse of six specific minors. Several of the Government’s motions are\naimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the\nvarious Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those maters. Although\nthat evidence is entirely improper and <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, the defense plainly intends to make this central\nto the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29).

As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2o2l) (“The\nGovernment’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening\nstatement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the follouing exceptions.”’). To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from\n\npresenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5579\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005580.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 26 of 4o\nUnited States v. Miles, 748 F.3d 485, 489 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (per curiam) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nIt is elementary that “the Government is not on trial in this case, and the jury will not be\nasked to pass on the adequacy of its investigation.” United States v. Carton, No. l7 Cr. 68o (CM),\n2ol8 WL 58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charged crimes. See United States v. Duncan,\nNo. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (“The length of the\ninvestigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially\na target of the investigation are all <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> pursuant to this principle.”); United States v.\nAleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of\nthe Government’s investigation are not appropriate lines of examination .. . .”), rev'd on other\ngrounds, 676 F.3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nThe defense argues that they are free to offer whatever evidence they like in order to\nchallenge the “thoroughness and even the good faith of the [government’s] investigation.” (Def.\nOpp. at 32 (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 445 (l995)). In support, the defense cites three\ndecades-old cases, none from this Circuit or any district in this Circuit. All arise under very\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo558o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005581.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 27 of 4o\nparticular set of circumstances, and none address evidentiary rulings. Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo36 (Sth Cir. l985), or evidence pointing touard an alternative perpetrator, Bouen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 6l2 (loth Cir. l986). See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bouen, the Tenth Circuit found\nthat if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo558l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005583.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 4o\nwould not have to stretch for cases about Brady disclosures from other circuits. See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation. The\nNew York investigation led to the charging decision in this case, and law enforcement officers\nfrom Florida are being called as limited fact witnesses. The Government does not expect to elicit\nthe NPA except perhaps to draw the sting if the Court permits cross-examination on the subject.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5583\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005586.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span> to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5586\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5587\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 34 of 4o\nD. The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span>\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5588\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 35 of 4o\nE. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span>\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5589\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005591.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\nconspiracy to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses associated with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v.

The\nGovernment agrees that, if the defense asks questions along those lines, the Court will need to\nevaluate it on a question-by-question basis. But questions that are relevant to consent but not the\ndefendant’s mens rea, and any argument to the jury about the Minor Victims’ consent, is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nand should be precluded.\n\nH. The Court Should Be Wary of the Defense Refusal to Address the Government’s\n\nMotions\n\nThe defendant has largely refused to respond to the Government’s motion to preclude\nevidence of the defendant’s other acts, offering the defendant’s oun statements, arguments\na.

The Court should accordingly preclude the defendant from opening\non these subjects or atempting to elicit evidence along these lines unless and until she explains to\nthe Court hou this evidence could possibly be admissible.\n\nAs explained above and in the Government’s motion, houever, there is significant risk that\nthe defense theories will contravene the Federal Rules of Evidence and the law of the Circuit to\nput <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> maters, such as the Florida investigation, before the jury.

The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others.

It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of exclusion\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.

That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse.

The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment ff ll-l2); and (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. 9] l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. J l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the conspiracy” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5675\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\ncharacter and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v.

The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

Sometimes she has\nclaimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, houever, Accuser-l has not made any\nallegation about being raped.\n\nAll the same, Accuser-l has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knouing that Mr. Epstein\nallegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in\nthis case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the\nindictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide\n“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.\n\nIt is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.\nBut what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege\nthat Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThe United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial\njuries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not\nbe misled by <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only\nduty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See\nUnited States v. Doyle, l3o F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. l997). A jury that has been misled by\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R.

Fed. R. Evid. 4ol, 4o2. Evidence is relevant if it tends to\nmake a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence. Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,\nmisleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\nFed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nHere, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nto the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein\nraped anyone. And Accuser-l has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in\nan alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and\ntransportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there\nis no argument that Accuser-l’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any\nother allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 4o2.\n\nEven if a rape allegation had some relevance, Rule 4o3 would still require its exclusion\nbecause the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of\nunfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. Evidence is\nunfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,\ncommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief v. United States, 5l9 U.S. l72,\nl8o (l997).\n\nHere, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-l (or anyone else) will suggest to the\njury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the\noffenses with which she has been charged.

To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005801.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases. As Judge Engelmayer explained\nwhen evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is\nan “unusually poor fit” in this area:\n\n[S]tudying the circumstances and psychological drivers of trafficked\n\nwomen is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory\n\nanimals. . . . Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a\n\nstudy, given the small size of the populations under review, and\n\ngiven the inherently individualized circumstances presented by\n\ndifferent perpetrators, victims, and contexts in this tumultuous and\n\nemotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the vocabulary of\n\nerror rates . . . is an unusually poor fit... . The testing that has been\n\ndone as to trauma bonding and coercive control, instead, necessarily\n\nuses more qualitative research methodologies. These involve\n\ninterviews and case studies and clinical examinations conducted\n\nover time.”\nFeb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 29:4-3o:2o, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l (PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No.\n335. Because statistical rigor is not a useful method for evaluating the reliability of qualitative\nresearch like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the Daubert analysis.\n\nContrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes\nof cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science.

That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 49 of 84\nprevious plans with Ferro to import narcotics ... was evidence of ‘other crimes’... .

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5834\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 55 of 84\nthe elements of the crimes the Court provides them, so any assumptions the jury might make about\nUnited Kingdom law are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.!4 See United States v. Vasquez, 82 F.3d 574, 577 (2d Cir.\nl996) (appropriate to reject defense request for an instruction if it does not “represent[] a theory\nof the defense with a basis in the record that would lead to acquital”). And the proposed jury\ninstruction that the sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 “cannot be considered ‘illegal’ or\n‘criminal’ or ‘unlawful’ for purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment” (Def. Mot. 4 at l5),\nis wrong on the law. The sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of the defendant’s\nguilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in contrast, creates serious risk that\nthe jury will think the Court is telling them that the conduct is lawful and therefore <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to\nthe case. It is not <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>: it is direct evidence of the crimes charged, and it should be put before\nthe jury.\nIV. There is No Basis to Preclude Co-Conspirator Statements at Trial\n\nOn October ll, the Government provided the defense with comprehensive Jencks Act\nmaterial for trial witnesses and its exhibits, along with a leter telling the defense, consistent with\nthe Court’s order, the identities of the individuals the Government intends to argue are co-\nconspirators at trial. The defense nonetheless asks the Court to enter an order precluding the\nGovernment from introducing any co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence\n‘4 Tn the event the Court instructs the jury on the age of consent in the United Kingdom, the\nGovernment requests that the Court also instruct the jury that the United Kingdom’s age of consent\nis <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and they should not consider it.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005859.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 76 of 84\na\n|\n\nFourth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 294 is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. l3 at\n2-3). Government Exhibit 294 displays a box containing “Twin Torpedos”—sex toys—seized\nduring the search of Epstein’s Palm Beach house. This photograph is corroborative of witness\ntestimony, which is expected to describe the presence of sex toys and that the defendant and\nEpstein used sex toys during their abuse.\n\nFifth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 3l3 is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2-\n3). Government Exhibit 3l3 is a photograph of the defendant and Epstein swimming together\nwhile nude. This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the relationship\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this photograph is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary foundation, is\nhearsay, and is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment. (Def.\nMot. l3 at 2-3). Government Exhibit 6o6 is a manual governing the operations of the Palm Beach\nhouse. A witness at trial is expected to authenticate this document and explain that it was the\nversion in effect at the house in 2oo5. Another witness is expected to testify about the rules in\neffect in the Palm Beach household during the time period of the charged conduct; those rules are\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5859\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005860.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo586o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005864.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5864\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 52\nalong these lines, that will open the door to other sexual behavior evidence. That\ndoor can remain at least partially closed if Rocchio is not permited to offer her\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly prejudicial testimony.\n\ne The government still hasn’t explained hou it helps the jury to be told that a victim\nof sexual abuse might make an immediate disclosure, or she might make an\nincremental disclosure, or she might make a delayed disclosure. Resp. at 27-3o.\nAnd when the government says, “[s]exual abuse also impacts the way memory is\nencoded,” that opinion is far outside Rocchio’s expertise because the parties agree\nthat she is not an expert in “the human brain or memory generally.” Resp. at 3o\nn.7.\n\nC. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing.\n\nThere is ample reason for this Court to exclude Rocchio’s testimony outright. At the very\nleast, Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a Daubert hearing. The government implicitly concedes as\nmuch. In a footnote, the government acknouledges the decision in United States v. Raniere, in\nwhich Judge Garaufis ordered a Daubert hearing on the government’s proposed expert testimony\non grooming. 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7-8. In that case, houever, the government withdrew its\nendorsement rather than submit to an Daubert hearing. Resp. at l9 n.3.\n\nJudge Garaufis reasoned that even if other courts in other cases had admited testimony\nabout grooming, “that [did] not make Dr. Hughes’s opinion about grooming techniques reliable\nunder the Daubert standard,” if only because “her extensive academic and clinical experience\nappears focused on victims of sexual abuse, not perpetrators.” See id. at *7. The same is true\nhere, particularly because Rocchio has no experience in, and there is no authority supporting her\nopinions on, grooming-by-proxy. Quite the contrary. The government’s late-breaking disclosure\nstates:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005988.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> that\nOO —“SCSCSCSCSCies\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5988\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005991.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 36 of 52\nalleged scheme to cause minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, or her knouledge of the\nsame. See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury instruction regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo599l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005998.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y.

The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006218.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page/7of4l\n\ne Awareness of the impact of hindsight bias “should temper any claims that so called\n‘grooming’ behaviors should have been noticed and either reported or avoided and that\nfailing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.” (/d.).\n\nAs set forth belou, the Government objects that these opinions are within the ken of the jury and\ninvade the province of the jury and the Court.\n\nDr. Dietz also offers the follouing opinions as to the “Halo effect”:\n\ne The “Halo effect” is “a cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive\nevaluation of one characteristic has a radiating effect on hou other, non-related\ncharacteristics of the individual are evaluated.” (/d.).\n\ne “Like many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeff[re]y Epstein exploited\nthe Halo effect to surround himself with people who would serve his needs.” (/d. at 6).\n\ne Epstein’s personality flaws “alloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to\ndo his bidding and to compartmentalize people into isolated cells in which none had\ncomplete information about his activities.” (/d. at 7).\n\nAs set forth belou, the Government objects that these opinions are an <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> invitation to jury\nnullification and an improper vehicle for introducing a factual narrative.\n\nDr. Dietz offers a lengthy series of objectionable opinions as to “Multiple Pathways to\n\nFalse Sex Assault Allegations.” (/d. at 7).

And if the Court excludes\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion on this issue, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.\n\nThe Government acknouledges that Dr. Dietz can offer reliable, relevant opinions in\nresponse to Dr. Rocchio. But Dr. Dietz’s proposed opinions include legal argument, opinions that\ninvade the province of the jury, and opinions that are themselves unreliable. Those should be\nexcluded.\n\n2. Opinions as to Hindsight Bias\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions that hindsight bias exists and should “temper” conclusions about\nwhether to impute knouledge to an individual (Ex. A at 5) do not convey any relevant information\nbeyond the ken of the average juror and are not helpful to the jury. Instead, they are a virtually\nunprecedented atempt to psychoanalyze the jurors and to supplant both their role as judges of the\nfacts and the Court’s role in instructing them.\n\nThe only possible relevance of hindsight bias in this case is the supposed bias of the jurors\nthemselves. This is not a case where it maters whether the opinion of a witness or a party at some\npoint suffered from hindsight bias. The primary purpose of the testimony is to convince the jurors\nto “temper” any conclusion that the defendant formed the requisite intent because the jurors might\nbe suffering from hindsight bias. (Ex. A at 5). Of course a factfinder should not confuse the\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6227\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006230.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Pagel9 of 4l\nparties can argue in closing arguments.” deWit v. UPS Ground Freight, Inc., No. l6 Civ. 36, 2ol7\nWL 59o5575, at *2 (N.D. Fl. Jul. 25, 2ol7) (citations and internal quotation marks omited). So\ntoo here.?\n\nThe defense’s offer of Dr. Dietz’s opinions on hindsight bias to “temper” the jurors’\nassessment of the evidence is thus virtually unprecedented. If this Court alloued such testimony\nin this case, houever, it would likely become much more common. This Court should decline to\nopen the door to the routine psychoanalysis of the jury in this way.\n\n3. Opinions as to the “Halo Effect”\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions concerning the “Halo effect”—.e., that “the positive evaluation of\none characteristic has a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual\nare evaluated” (Ex. A at 5)—are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to any issue to be considered by the jury and appear to\nbe offered in an effort to encourage jury nullification by engendering sympathy for the defendant,\nas well as to offer a factual narrative based on no reliable evidence through a witness plainly\nincompetent to do so.\n\nNone of the charges in this case relate in any way to the defendant’s appraisal of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s character or whether the defendant did or did not view him in the manner suggested by\nthe Halo effect. Simply put, if every word that Dr. Dietz said regarding the “Halo effect” and\nEpstein’s “brilliance” in exploiting it were taken as true, the defendant would be guilty if she met\nthe elements of the charged offenses—exactly as she would be if every word Dr. Dietz said on this\n3 Accordingly, even if the defense somehou put at issue whether a witness’s opinion on some\nmater was affected by hindsight bias—and the Government cannot currently envision hou this is\nlikely—the proper way of litigating an issue so squarely within the ken of the jury is through lay\nevidence and argument, not expert testimony. See deWit, 2ol7 WL 59o5575, at *2.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo623o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 25 of 4l\n\nnot reliable. The article that Dr. Dietz relies on—in fact “nearly verbatim” (Ex. A at 7)—was\nintended as a research agenda to explain the (undoubted) instances of false accusations, not to\nprovide a roadmap for establishing the falsity of any allegation. (See Ex. C at 98 (“Part of the\nfocus of the present paper, then, is to bring atention to the dearth of psychological literature\ninvestigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual assault and to propose\na model specifying the major causal pathways to false allegations. These pathways are intended\nas a model for further empirical investigation.” (emphasis added))). Indeed, the authors were\nemphatic that their article not be misused as a simplistic means of “determining the accuracy of\nspecific accusations.” (Ex. C at 98 (“[A] legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is\nthe misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific accusations.”)).\n\nFinally, even to the extent that Dr. Dietz’s opinions on any of these “pathways” offers any\nexpertise that is truly beyond the ken of the jury, there is no justification for allouing him to offer\nthese opinions in the abstract without any fit to the facts of the case. At a minimum, unless and\nuntil there is any evidence creating a predicate for the relevance of any of these mental disorders,\nit is simply <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>—and highly prejudicial—for a psychiatric expert to enumerate a number of\nmental disorders and conjecture that they could cause unreliable testimony. See, e.g., LVL XII\nBrands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642 (finding testimony fails Daubert’s “fit” requirement where\nthere is a lack of “record foundation”).* Thus even if, contrary to the arguments above, the Court\nbelieved some of the opinions on these “pathways” could under some circumstances be helpful to\nthe jury, the Court should defer on the admissibility of such opinions until the evidence at trial\n8 Of course, to the extent a witness’s mental condition is relevant, it should not be simply the\nsubject of lay diagnosis by the jury, as Dr. Dietz’s notice seems to suggest.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 28 of 4l\nsuch an opinion is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and should be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. See,\ne.g., LVL XII Brands, Inc., 2o9 F. Supp. 3d at 642; Boucher, 73 F.3d at 2l (“expert testimony\nshould be excluded if it is [inter alia] in essence an apples and oranges comparison” (internal\nquotation marks and ellipsis omited)).\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not\nreliable. Such an opinion—essentially that it is highly unlikely for abuse victims to continue\nrelationships with their abusers after the first act of sexual assault—is patently implausible and\ninconsistent with the extensive literature on grooming, the pimp-prostitute relationship, delayed\ndisclosure of sexual assaults, and delayed onset of PTSD, all of which recognize the relative\nfrequency with which victims of sexual assaults continue contact with their abusers. Indeed, such\nopinions would seem in great tension even with Dr. Dietz’s oun writings on grooming; if he truly\nbelieves that abused children are unlikely to continue contact with their abusers or wear clothing\nprovided by their abusers, it would be hard to see hou he could express surprise that “even today,\nfar too many people, including many who should knou beter, have difficulty grasping the\npossibility of nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent acquaintance molestation, as their\npreconceptions of childhood innocence and predatory molesters are too strong to allou them to\naccept that children can be so readily manipulated into doing or allouing things that others find\nabhorrent.” (See Park Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction”, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence 28, 29\n(2ol8), Ex. D; see also Ex. A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 4l\nwidespread or general acceptance, or are otherwise reliable. See Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 593-95, 592\n&n.lo. Accordingly, unless the defense meets its burden of affirmatively establishing that this\nopinion, as applied to the context of this case, meets the Daubert reliability standard, it should be\nprecluded. See, e.g., P.S. ex rel. Nelson v. The Farm, Inc., 658 F. Supp. 2d l28l, l288 (D. Kan.\n2oo9) (excluding as unreliable an expert’s opinion that children typically report abuse in response\nto direct questioning without holding hearing). Should the defense come forward with some\nevidence of reliability in its response papers, the Government would respectfully request an\nopportunity to reply or, in the alternative, a Daubert hearing to probe the issue.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to the context of this case, the defendant\nhas not established the reliability of these opinions, which should be precluded or, at a minimum,\nexplored at a hearing. And to the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to other contexts,\nthey are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.”\n\nI. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED EXPERT TESTIMONY OF\n\nDR. ELIZABETH LOFTUS SHOULD BE PRECLUDED\n\nA. Background\n\nThe defense seeks to offer expert opinions of Dr. Loftus on “the workings of human\nmemory.” (Ex. A at l). Specifically, the defense seeks to offer testimony from Dr. Loftus\nregarding:\n\nl. “[H]ou memory fades and weakens over time.”\n\n’ The Government understands that Dr. Dietz is not planning on atending the November lo, 2o2l\nDaubert hearing of Dr. Rocchio, and the Government has not to date received any Rule 26.2\ndisclosures from Dr. Dietz, or even a complete bibliography of the sources cited in his disclosure.\nThe Government respectfully requests that, should a hearing be scheduled on the reliability of Dr.\nDietz’s opinions, that hearing be held after the defense’s response to this motion and after all\nnecessary Rule 26.2 disclosures are made.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo624o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006243.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 32 of 4l\nwhich affirmed the district court’s exclusion of expert testimony and finding that witness cross-\nexamination was adequate to “reveal any faults in the identification”).\n\nWith respect to Dr. Loftus specifically, several federal courts have excluded Dr. Loftus’s\ntestimony on memory as either unhelpful to the jury or as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> given the facts of the case.\nSee, e.g., Curry, 977 F.2d at lo5o-52 (affirming district court’s exclusion of Dr. Loftus’s testimony\nabout memory in the context of witness identifications, including the fading of memories, witness\nconfidence in memories, distortion of memories); United States v. George, 975 F.2d l43l, l432\n(9th Cir. l992) (affirming district court’s denial of funds to defendant to hire Dr. Loftus to testify\nregarding eyewitness identification); Moore, 798 F.2d at l3ll-l3 (affirming district court’s\nexclusion of Dr. Loftus’s testimony about memory in context of eyewitness identifications,\nincluding testimony about diminished memory and the incorporation of inaccurate post-event\ninformation); Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *5-6 (excluding Dr. Loftus’s testimony regarding\nthe corruption of memory and related topics); Heine, 2ol7 WL 526o784, at *2 (excluding memory\nexpert and discussing Dr. Loftus and Libby); Libby, 46l F. Supp. 2d at l4 (excluding expert\ntestimony of one expert in a case where the defendant also offered Dr. Loftus’s research and\ntestimony that the “principles which [the expert] would testify to are not commonly understood by\njurors”); see also R.D. v. Shohola, Inc., l6 Civ. olo56, 2ol9 WL 6o53223, at *lo-l3 (M.D. Pa.\nNov. l5, 2ol9) (in civil case, excluding Dr. Loftus’s testimony because it “simply restates maters\nwithin the common understanding of lay jurors” and because her opinions were speculative). '°\n‘© It appears that Dr. Loftus has also testified as an expert in federal cases. See, e.g., United States\nv. Seltzer, 794 F.2d ll4, ll8 (6th Cir. l986) (discussing defense expert testimony of Dr. Loftus\nthat it is not unusual for individuals to forget events); Lam v. City of San Jose, No. l4 Civ. 877\n(PSG), 2ol5 WL 6954967, at *2 (N.D. Cal.

Such research may thus be\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\nTo the extent that the Court believes that the defense may have carried its burden of\nestablishing the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on false memory formation, the Government\nrespectfully requests a Daubert hearing to test the reliability of these opinions.”\n\nEven if any such opinions are reliable, houever, they should not be admited absent an\naffirmative shouing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee n. (stating\nthat “generalized” expert testimony must “‘fit’ the facts of the case”). For example, testimony\nabout the ways in which “false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event\ninformation and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to this case. At that\nlevel of generality, it has no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is no evidence that\nwhatever “occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about which Dr. Loftus intends to testify\nhappened to any witness in this case, much less in a manner that reliably affects memory or would\nbe probative to the jury. Thus, as with Dr. Dietz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus seeks to offer\non false memory formation should be limited to those as to which there is a clear evidentiary\npredicate establishing their “fit” to the case.\n\nAs with Dr. Dietz, see footnote 9, supra, if a hearing is necessary, the Government similarly\nrequests that it be conducted after receiving the defense response and after all necessary Rule 26.2\ndisclosures have been made.\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006363.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page3of54\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits the follouing motions in /imine. First, the\nGovernment respectfully requests that the Court protect the dignity and privacy of victims by\npermiting certain witnesses to testify under pseudonyms or using only their first names, and\npermiting the filing of related trial exhibits under seal. Second, the Government moves to admit\nprior consistent statements made by the minor victims in this case. Third, the Government\nmoves to preclude the defense from distracting the jury with <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and confusing testimony\nand argument relating to the investigative and prosecutive decisions of law enforcement agents\nand prosecutors. In particular, the Government moves to preclude the defense from calling\nagents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), in an improper effort to put the\nGovernment on trial. Fourth, and relatedly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court\npreclude the defense from offering argument or evidence at trial in support of the defense’s\nunfounded theory that the Government is prosecuting the defendant for nefarious reasons.

The Court Should Not Permit the Defense to Elicit Evidence About Charging\n\nDecisions or Possible Reasons for Them\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the\ncharges in the indictment should be excluded as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court\nmay “exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of\none or more of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue\ndelay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.” Accordingly, any evidence\nthat is likely to distract the jury from the issue of guilt or innocence should be excluded under\nRule 4o3. See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution “for turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trial’).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury.

Such decisions are\noften made after consideration of multiple factors, including, for example, available prosecutorial\nor investigative resources and a desire not to disrupt an ongoing investigation. Even if a decision\nnot to prosecute is based upon the prosecutor’s view of the available evidence, it is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nboth because investigations routinely uncover additional evidence and because it is not the\nprosecutor’s view of the evidence that maters, but rather that of the jury.\n\nThose points are particularly true here. It is entirely speculative to assume that the\nUSAO-SDFL did not charge the defendant in 2oo8—or immunize her by name in the non-\nprosecution agreement—and that this Office did not charge her in 2ol9 solely because it lacked\nthe evidence to do so and that such evidence could not have been developed had the investigation\nfocused its resources on the defendant. See Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“Any connection\nbetween purported concerns about [a witness’s] identification [of the defendant] and the decision\nnot to charge in l997 would thus be based on speculation and conjecture by government\nwitnesses who did not decide whether to charge [the defendant] in l997.” (emphasis in\noriginal)). And because signification portions of the Government’s evidence were developed\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6385\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006387.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 27 of 54\nautomobile is deemed to be the possession of all passengers in the automobile unless the firearm\nis found on the person of a particular passenger. See id. at 245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law\n§ 265.l5(3)). The district atorney dropped the charges against the defendant and three other\nindividuals, leaving only one of the individuals facing state charges for other firearms. See id. at\n245.\n\nWhite therefore sought to admit the initial charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing\nthat “if the gun had actually been recovered from his person, none of the other individuals would\nhave been charged with possession of that particular gun.” /d. at 245. The district court rejected\nthat argument, and the Second Circuit reversed, explaining that the “decision to charge all\npassengers traveling in the vehicle with possession . . . supports White’s theory that none of the\nfirearms was found on his person and discredits the officers’ testimony to the contrary.” Jd. at\n247.\n\nThis case thus contrasts quite sharply with White. In White, the state’s earlier charging\ndecision directly contradicted a consequential fact in the case—whether the defendant was in\nactual possession of the gun. It was therefore highly relevant as evidence used to undermine the\ncredibility of the officers testifying to the defendant’s possession. Here, houever, the\nGovernment’s past charging decisions are entirely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to any factual issue in the case or\nthe credibility of any witness. See Wats, 934 F. Supp. 2d at 485 (distinguishing White in a\nconspiracy case because “a conspiracy necessarily involves agreement amongst more than one\nactor to engage in criminal conduct for which all members of the conspiracy may be found\nequally culpable’).\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 54\n\nSecond, even if the decision of whether to charge the defendant in 2oo8 or 2ol9 had\nsome minimal relevance, it would be substantially outweighed by the dangers of confusing the\nissues and misleading the jury. As courts in this Circuit have routinely held, introduction of\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> decisions of whom and when to charge presents a substantial risk of confusing and\nmisleading the jury because a prosecutorial charging decision would tend to misdirect the jury’s\natention to a discretionary decision that is not connected to the ultimate quantum of evidence\nthat the Government adduces at trial. See, e.g., Borrero, 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (holding that\n“the limited amount of probative value that the . . . charging decisions add is substantially\noutweighed by the risk of undue confusion and an unnecessary sideshou into [the]\ncircumstances”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *2 (“[T]he reasons for the Kings County District\nAtorney’s Office decision not to charge [the defendant] in l997 are unknoun and would cause\nconfusion of and speculation by the jury.”). That evidence invites the jury to abdicate its oun\nview of the fully developed evidentiary record in favor of speculation about charging decisions\nby prosecutors at different times looking at different evidence and weighing different factors.\n\nThose risks are particularly acute here. Any discussion of the Government’s prior\ncharging decisions would require extended trials within a trial concerning the bases for those\ndecisions. For instance, if the defense wishes to argue that the USAO-SDFL did not charge the\ndefendant in the Florida Investigations because those investigations did not generate inculpatory\nevidence as to the defendant, it therefore puts at issue the non-prosecution agreement and the\ncircumstances of its creation. As the Court is aware, those circumstances were the subject of a\n29o page report from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility. (See\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006390.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 54\nhearsay. See id. at 246 (majority op.) (charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination\nonly “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2ol4 WL l988l3, at *l-2 (precluding cross examination of\nagent regarding district atorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).\n\nThe Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,\nhearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admited.\n\nB. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And\n\nInvestigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations\n\nFor similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to\nthe jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s\ninvestigation, including the duration of those investigations.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nIt is setled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence\nthat had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo)\n(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does\nnot tend to shou that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.\nat 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 8ol F. App’x l9, 24 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (summary order)\n(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the\nGovernment has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its\ncase.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the\nabsence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such\ncomment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had\nfailed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, l75 F. App’x 37o, 375\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of54\n\n(2d Cir. 2oo6) (summary order) (affirming a district court that sustained an objection during a\ndefense summation). Accordingly, issues like the “length of the investigation, the investigative\ntechniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially a target of the investigation are\nall <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9); see United States v. Aleynikov, 785 F. Supp. 2d 46, 65 (S.D.N.Y.\n2oll) (“As a general mater, the quality and scope of the Government’s investigation are not\nappropriate lines of examination ... .”), rev’d on other grounds by 676 F. 3d 7l (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\n2. Discussion\n\nIt is not relevant or probative for the defense to elicit evidence or make argument about\ninvestigative steps taken or untaken by the Government, either in this investigation or the Florida\nInvestigations, or about the length of those investigations.\n\nThe issue before the jury is whether the admissible evidence before it demonstrates the\ndefendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The particular investigative steps used (or not\nused) by the Government, and the length of the investigation, are wholly <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to question.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4ol. Rather, the jury’s decision should be fixed on “the evidence or lack of\nevidence that had been presented at trial.” Saldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d at 52. The defendant should be\nprecluded from eliciting testimony about facts the jury cannot properly consider, and which do\nnot bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nMoreover, whatever marginal relevance a discussion of investigative steps or the length\nof an investigation may have is outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues and misleading\nthe jury. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. It is routine practice in this District to give an instruction that\n“the government is not on trial.” See, e.g., United States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 5l, 54-55 (2d\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo639l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006392.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 54\nCir. 2ol7) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not on trial” is\n“appropriate” (internal quotation marks omited)). Introducing evidence about investigative\ndecisions would only confuse the issues properly before the jury and suggest that jurors should\nfocus on the history of investigations into Epstein and his co-conspirators rather than the\nevidence against the defendant.\n\nJudge Stein’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is\ninstructive. In that case, a defendant sought to call a case agent on three topics: (l) the length of\nthe FBI’s investigation, (2) the law enforcement techniques that were used and not used, and (3)\ncontacts and communications with that defendant prior to his arrest. Leter, id., Dkt. No. l3o.\nThe Court explained that defense counsel “wanted to bring out that [the defendant] was not a\ntarget of the investigation for a long period of time.” May l6, 2ol9 Tr. at ll68:l2-23, id., Dkt.\nNo. l59. Citing Saldarriaga, the Court explained that the argument was “absolutely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,”\nbecause “[w]hat maters is whether the government has proven its case against [the defendant]\nhere beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jd. at ll68:l2-25; see Duncan, 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3\n(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and when Locust became a\ntarget is therefore not admissible pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.”).\n\nSo too here. It is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> what investigative steps were taken during the Florida\ninvestigations or this investigation, and it is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> hou long those investigations lasted.\nTestimony and argument on those points would not assist the jury in evaluating the defendant’s\nguilt or innocence, but it would confuse the jury by directing them to focus on investigators’\nconduct. Especially where the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6392\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 54\n(see generally Dep’t of Justice, Office of Professional Responsibility Report, Dkt. No. 293 Ex. A\nat v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.\n\nThe defense is free to offer its oun evidence about the victims and instances charged in\nthis case, and it is free to atempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate\nevidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would\nonly serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> information. This Court should\npreclude such evidence.\n\nC. The Defense Should Not Be Permited to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering\n\na Valid Basis for Their Testimony\n\nAs explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the\noutcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the\nlength of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about\nunrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in\norder to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents\nunless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.\n\nThe Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.\nrel. Touhy v. Regan, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the\nFlorida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this\nDistrict against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is atached as Exhibit A. According to the\nTouhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § l6.23(c), the\ndefendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as\nwell as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6393\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006394.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 54\nabout numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents\nthey obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at l-2).\n\nBut as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”\n“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and\nmisleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before\nthe jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified\nfor their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense\nidentifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.\n\nIV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s\nAlleged Motives for Prosecution\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a\nscapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. l42, at l (“[T]he\ngovernment has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false\nas it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to\nthe question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative\n’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of\nnumerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of\n“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The\nagents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that\ngovern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent\ntestimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents\nabout information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay\nresponses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the\ndefendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6394\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006397.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of54\nreasons for the prosecution have no bearing whatsoever on the jury’s proper function. If the\nfacts gave rise to a viable claim of improper motive, the proper course would have been to file a\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment on those grounds. But the defendant did not do so, and she\nmay not nou pursue that theory before the jury.\n\nEvidence or argument about Epstein’s death while awaiting prosecution is also <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nand substantially more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. The fact that Epstein\ndied while awaiting prosecution more than fifteen years after the charged conduct is entirely\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Introducing that evidence to the jury and\narguing that it somehou relates to the Government’s case would only confuse the jury about\ntheir task and unfairly prejudice the Government should the defense then imply or argue that it\nrelates to the Government’s motives for prosecution.\n\nV. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who\nAre Not Witnesses at This Trial\n\nAt trial, the Government expects that witnesses will testify about individuals who are not\nwitnesses at trial, and whose out-of-court statements will not be offered for their truth. For\nexample, witnesses will testify about Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6, who will not be\nwitnesses at trial. The Court should preclude the defense from atempting to impeach the\ncredibility of individuals who will not be witnesses at trial, and whose credibility is therefore\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.\n\nAn “essential safeguard” of a fair trial is the “right to place the witness in his proper\nseting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test.” United States v. Harvey,\n547 F.2d 72o, 723 (2d Cir. l976) (citation and internal quotation marks omited). Accordingly,\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006398.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 54\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence contain extensive provisions governing the impeachment of\nwitnesses. Fed. R. Evid. 6o7-l3. Rule 8o6 also authorizes atacks on the credibility of hearsay\ndeclarants, agents, and co-conspirators when those individual’s statements have been admited\ninto evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 8o6. This rule “effectively treats the hearsay declarant as a witness\nfor impeachment and rehabilitation purposes.” 2 McCormick on Evid. § 324.2 (8th ed.).\n\nFor individuals who are not witnesses and not hearsay declarants, houever, none of those\nrules apply. Instead, those non-witnesses’ “credibility is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” United States v. McGouan,\n58 F.3d 8, l5-l6 (2d Cir. l995). The Second Circuit has therefore “clearly established . . . the\nprinciple that a statement not offered to prove the truth of the mater asserted may not be\nimpeached under Rule 8o6.” United States v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 2ll, 2l7 (2d Cir. 2oo6); see\nUnited States v. Dipietro, No. o2 Cr. l237 (SWK), 2oo5 WL l43o483, at *l (S.D.N.Y. June l7,\n2oo5) (“It has long been the case in the Second Circuit that it is proper to preclude cross-\nexamination of an individual whose statements are not admited for their truth.”). Even if the\nindividual is a “‘central figure’” in the case, “a district court need not allou impeachment” if the\nindividual’s “out-of-court statements were not admited for their truth.” United States v. Regan,\nlo3 F.3d lo72, lo83 (2d Cir. l997) (quoting McGouan, 58 F.3d at l5-l6); see United States v.\nPerez, No. o5 Cr. 44l (PKL), 2oo5 WL 27o9l6o, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

See Elbert, 56l F.3d at 777-78\n(affirming exclusion of evidence of a victim’s consent under Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2). In\nthe absence of a consent defense, evidence about the victims’ consent to sexual activity should\nalso be excluded as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. See Fed. R. Evid. 4ol.

The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument Sounding in Nullification\n\nThe defendant may atempt to offer evidence of aspects of her life that may tend to elicit\nthe juror’s sympathy, such as her charitable works or evidence of her family history.

See supra Section VII. Evidence and argument that makes the defendant\nappear sympathetic for reasons unrelated to the charges at issue should also be excluded as\ninviting the jury to acquit a defendant even where the evidence proves her guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Juries are not “to act based on their... sympathy.” United States v. Stroming,\n838 F. App’x 624, 627 (2d Cir. 2o2l) (summary order); see, e.g., United States v. Mustaga, 753\nF.

Evidence of this sort may well be <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly prejudicial. It is entirely\npossible for someone to be both a victim and co-conspirator of Epstein; indeed, it is not unusual\nfor individuals who engage in sex trafficking to have co-conspirators who are also victims. To\ncomplete the offenses charged in the Indictment, the defendant needs to intend the transportation,\nenticement, or trafficking of Minor Victims, or agree to do so. Accordingly, any victimization—\nif it occurred—would not necessarily exculpate her or negate her mens rea. And only certain\nlimited evidence would be sufficient to provide a foundation for a duress or coercion defense.\nSee United States v.

At best, it would confuse the jury\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006412.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 438 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 52 of 54\ninto thinking that victimization was in some way relevant to its evaluation of the defendant’s\nmens rea,\n\nBecause the Government is aware of no evidence that the defendant was a victim of\nEpstein, and because any such evidence may well be <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly prejudicial in any\nevent, the Court should preclude the defense from discussing it at trial absent a specific offer of\nproof in advance as to the nature and relevance of such evidence. !\n\nXI. The Defendant Should Be Precluded from Arguing That She Was A “Prevailing\nParty” in Civil Litigation\n\nThe Court should preclude the defense from inaccurately suggesting to the jury that the\ndefendant prevailed in civil litigation related to some of the events at issue at trial.\n\nBy way of background, Minor Victim-2 filed a civil action in this District, bringing\nclaims against the defendant and the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. No |§=—— |\nFo Minor Victim-2 received a substantial setlement from the estate after\nparticipating in a compensation program for victims of Jeffrey Epstein. As part of that\nsetlement, Minor Victim-2 moved to dismiss her civil action in its entirety. The defendant—\nwho was represented in that lawsuit by atorneys who represent her in this criminal case—asked\n'° The Government is not moving specifically to preclude a defense or evidence based on Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l2.2 because the defense has represented that it is not planning to\noffer such a defense or evidence. Specifically, if a defendant intends to (l) assert an insanity\ndefense, or (2) introduce “expert evidence relating to a mental disease or defect or any other\nmental condition of the defendant bearing on . . . the issue of guilt,” the defendant must provide\nwriten notice to the Government “within the time provided for filing a pretrial motion or at any\nlater time the court sets.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l2.2(a)-(b). The defense has not provided such\nnotice, and has informed the Government that they do not intend to rely on any defense covered\nby the Rule. Accordingly, the Government understands that the defense has waived any Rule\nl2.2 defense.\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo64l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006465.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 48 of 69\nD. Evidence and Argument About the Scope, Timeline, and Investigative Steps of\nPrior Investigations Is Admissible\n\nThe government’s motion to preclude the defense from eliciting evidence about the\ninvestigative steps taken in the Florida Investigation and the New York Investigation, and the\nduration of those investigations (see Mot. at 29-32), is entirely off base and breathtaking in the\nscope of what it seeks to restrict. It is as if the government will not tolerate any questioning\nabout its investigations at all. That is certainly not the law. For example, the decision to\ninterview a witness is an investigative step. Does the government really mean to suggest that\nquestioning the case agents about who they spoke to and when they spoke to them is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>?\nSimilarly, the decision to issue a subpoena for documents is an investigative step. Does the\ngovernment really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents about which documents they\nsubpoenaed and when they subpoenaed them is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>? Furthermore, the government will\nseek to offer numerous items of evidence collected in both the Florida and New York\nInvestigations. Does the government really mean to suggest that questioning the case agents\nabout when those investigations began and ended is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>? Surely not. Such questions are\nentirely appropriate and will yield relevant, admissible evidence. The government cannot\npossibly try to prevent the defense from asking these types of valid questions or from calling the\ncase agents as witnesses to answer them.\n\nThe government seems to be conflating “investigative steps” with “investigative\ntechniques,” even though the defense’s Touhy leter does not request testimony from the case\nagents about “investigative techniques.” See Mot., Ex. A (requesting testimony “concerning the\nscope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps\ntaken by the agents”). The defense is aware of the rule that it may comment on the absence of\nproof in the record, but it is not permited to argue that the government should have used any\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6465\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 4o\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI.

See United States v. Flores, 945\nF.3d 687, 7o6 (2d Cir. 2ol9).\n\nFollouing defense atacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates\noffering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the\nGovernment expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge\nthat the declarant “recently fabricated [their testimony] or acted from a recent improper influence\nor motive,” Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i), many other statements will be offered to “rehabilitate\nthe declarant’s credibility as a witness,” including from charges that the declarant has given\ninconsistent statements or has a faulty memory, Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(l)(B)(i). Because the\ngrounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the\nGovernment will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from\nits witnesses.\n\nIl. The Court Should Preclude the Defense from Making Improper Arguments and\nProffering <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span> Evidence\n\nAt trial, the jury will be asked to determine whether the defendant conspired with others to\narrange for the sexual abuse of six specific minors. Several of the Government’s motions are\naimed at preventing the defense from surprising the Court and the Government with <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,\ninflammatory, and highly prejudicial arguments.\n\nThe defense response makes clear that they intend to put before the jury the history of the\nvarious Epstein investigations in other jurisdictions and the outcomes of those maters. Although\nthat evidence is entirely improper and <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, the defense plainly intends to make this central\nto the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29).

As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s\nmotions, any evidence or argument is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is\nhighly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its\nopening statement or atempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until\nthe defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United\nStates v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2ol8) (summary order) (““The making and timing\nof opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”\n(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 7ol F.2d l7, 2l (2d Cir. l983)) (alteration omited)); United\nStates v. Ahaiwe, No. 2o Cr. l79 (DLC), 2o2l WL 2l34922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

To proceed\notherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or atempts to elicit other improper\nevidence that could cause a mistrial.\n\nA. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the\nDefendant\n\nA defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.\n\nOpp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, l3 F.4th l58, l77 (2d Cir. 2o2l)). “The right is\n\nnot, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and\n\nevidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, l3 F.4th at l77 (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omited). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from\n\npresenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo654l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006542.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 26 of 4o\nUnited States v. Miles, 748 F.3d 485, 489 (2d Cir. 2ol4) (per curiam) (citation and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nIt is elementary that “the Government is not on trial in this case, and the jury will not be\nasked to pass on the adequacy of its investigation.” United States v. Carton, No. l7 Cr. 68o (CM),\n2ol8 WL 58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). The issue before the jury is simply whether,\n“in light of [the] evidence or lack of evidence, the jury [is] convinced beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which [she is] charged.” United States v.\nSaldarriaga, 2o4 F.3d 5o, 52 (2d Cir. 2ooo) (per curiam). Accordingly, there is no basis to offer\nevidence about why the Government or the USAO-SDFL opened their respective investigations,\nhou they resolved those investigations, or the death of Jeffrey Epstein. These issues simply do\nnot relate to the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charged crimes. See United States v. Duncan,\nNo. l8 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (“The length of the\ninvestigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact that [the defendant] was not initially\na target of the investigation are all <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> pursuant to this principle.”); United States v.\nAleynikov, 785 F.

Instead, these cases concern\nBrady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which\na witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d lo34,\nlo36 (Sth Cir. l985), or evidence pointing touard an alternative perpetrator, Bouen v. Maynard,\n799 F.2d 593, 6l2 (loth Cir. l986). See also Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant\n“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).\nIn addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would\nbe used to “atack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 5l4 U.S. at 446.\n\nThe defense would rest a pile of <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> evidence on this slender reed. In their view,\nfrom the principle that the defense can atack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may\nelicit any information aimed at explaining—and atacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and\nprosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the\n“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised\nopportunities to atack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles\nprovides no guidance about what evidence must be admited at trial or what lines of questioning\nmust be permited to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”\nWatson v. Greene, 64o F.3d 5ol, 5l2 n.ll (2d Cir. 2oll) (emphasis added, alteration in original,\ncitation omited), nor do the other cases.\n\nEven if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of\nBrady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bouen, the Tenth Circuit found\nthat if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6543\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 4o\nwould not have to stretch for cases about Brady disclosures from other circuits. See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so. It is the defense’s plan to introduce information about the internal case opening\nand charging decisions of the USAO-SDFL and this Office, a summary of media coverage, and a\nhost of other <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> topics.'* The circus this would create at trial vastly outweighs any\n'3 Tn any event, if any investigation can be atacked, it is only the New York investigation. The\nNew York investigation led to the charging decision in this case, and law enforcement officers\nfrom Florida are being called as limited fact witnesses. The Government does not expect to elicit\nthe NPA except perhaps to draw the sting if the Court permits cross-examination on the subject.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6545\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006548.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 4o\n\nIn any event, even if the NPA were admissible, that would not open the door to introducing\nthe defense’s wish list of arguments about the New York and Florida investigations. The NPA is\nan agreement between Epstein and a different U.S. Atorney’s Office that resolved a different\ninvestigation, with provisions that—the defense argues—are useful impeachment for two\nwitnesses. Conducting that impeachment does not require the defense to offer evidence about why\nthe New York investigation started, or the timing of charges against the defendant, or various\ninvestigators’ views of the quantum of evidence generated against the defendant at any time. '*\n\nC. Evidence that the Defendant was Not Charged by the USAO-SDFL is <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span> to\n\nMinor Victim-4’s Credibility\n\nThe defense argues that the fact that the defendant was not charged by the USAO-SDFL\nafter the Florida investigation is probative of Minor Victim-4’s credibility, because Minor Victim-\n4 was interviewed by the FBI at the time and did not implicate the defendant (according to the\ndefendant). The defense brief again recites at length its view of her statements to law enforcement.\n(Def. Opp. at 36-39). That argument is incorrect. The defense is free to cross-examine Minor\n'S The defense suggests that telling the jury that the defendant was not charged in the NPA is\nnecessary because the jury might otherwise speculate on hou the Florida investigation ended and\nwhether the defendant was charged in that investigation. (Def. Opp. at 3l). That point highlights\nthat the defense intends to use the NPA, even if elicited on cross, as a proxy for the argument that\nthe defendant was not charged in the Florida investigation. There is no reason to think the jury\nwill so speculate if they do not learn hou the Florida investigation terminated. But if they do so\nlearn, they might incorrectly assume that the defendant was not charged solely because that\ninvestigation could not have generated inculpatory evidence against the defendant, which the\nGovernment is permited to rebut. Although the defense argues that the Government would not\ndiscuss the circumstances of the NPA (/d. at 3l), the Government might have to do so if the NPA\nbecomes central to the defense case and is used to invite the jury to think that no evidence\ninculpating the defendant existed in 2oo7.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Gov’t Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is cumulative of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4’s\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because “the\npoint will be made and can be duly ‘hammered home’ on cross-examination” without using the\ncharging decision, which “implicate[s] a variety of additional considerations”).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculate—\nfalsely—that the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendant—and only the defendant—who will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6549\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006550.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 34 of 4o\nD. The Government Should Preclude Testimony from Case Agents About <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span>\n\nMaters\n\nThe defense claims it needs to call case agents to talk about investigative steps, but fails to\nidentify any question about an investigative step that would yield relevant information.\n\nThe defense does not identify a single relevant topic in their brief. (Def. Opp. at 4o-4l).\nThey have made clear, houever, that they intend to put before the jury numerous <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> topics:\n(l) the thoroughness of the Government’s investigation, untethered from any other defense theory\n(id. at 4l); (2) the scope and timeline of the Florida and New York investigations (id. at 4o\n(discussing “when those investigations began and ended”)); see United States v. Duncan, No. l8\nCr. 289 (SHS), 2ol9 WL 22lo663, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2ol9) (concluding that the length of\nthe investigation is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39\n(stating that a special agent “had first-hand knouledge that [the defendant] was not charged in the\nproposed SDFL indictment because she presented the indictment to the grand jury.”). The defense\nhas also remained entirely silent as to whether they intend to call the case agents to testify as\n“summary witnesses . . . to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida\nInvestigations or this one.” (Gov’t Mot. at 33).\n\nThe Government’s position is simply that, before the defense calls the case agents and\n“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the investigations” (Def. Opp. at 4l), the defense should\nhave to identify for the Court the evidence relevant to the defendant’s guilt or innocence that they\nplan to elicit. Moreover, the defense should be precluded from previewing in their opening\nstatement any argument or evidence along these lines, unless and until they make an offer of proof\nand seek a ruling from the Court.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006551.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 35 of 4o\nE. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are <span class=\"highlight\">Irrelevant</span>\n\nThe defense claims it is proper to cast aspersions on the Government’s alleged motives for\nprosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be permited to advance theories that\nEpstein’s death motivated the “timing of the charges” in this case. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense\nconcedes that they have not established a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. (/d.). That is\nbecause they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the\ndefense is not permited to direct this argument to the jury simply because they lack a basis to\nmake that argument to the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second Circuit has explained\nthat claims of purported government misconduct must be ‘directed to the court rather than jury.’””\n(quoting United States v. Regan, lo3 F.3d lo72, lo82 (2d Cir. l997)))).\n\nAs the Government said in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty\nand the defendant is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They are not free, houever, to argue that—\nirrespective of guilt or innocence—the defendant is being prosecuted because Epstein is dead.\nCertainly, the defense could not make that argument absent any evidence, and no agent—including\nthe Florida and New York case agents—can offer hearsay testimony about why they think\nprosecutors charged or did not charge certain individuals at certain times. And to be clear, the\nagents would testify that this case was charged promptly after the Government was in a position\nto prove the defendant’s guilt.\n\n34\nDOJ-OGR-oooo655l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 4o\noffenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-4o). Accordingly, there is no\nbasis to offer evidence or make argument related to the Minor Victims’ consent.\n\nIn Counts Two and Four, the defendant is charged under the Mann Act with transporting a\nminor with intent to violate New York Penal Law § l3o.55, and enticing a minor to do the same.\nThat crime does not relate to prostitution. In Counts One and Three, the defendant is charged with\nconspiracy to violate the same statute—not “varying local state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional\nlocations,” (Def. Opp. at 47), and not violating the Mann Act with intent to commit prostitution.\nIn Count Six, the defendant is charged with sex trafficking of a person less than eighteen. In Count\nFive, the defendant is charged with conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nBecause these offenses all involve crimes with victims belou specified age cutoffs for\nwhich consent is not a defense, consent is not at issue in this case. The defense is therefore wrong\nwhen it argues that the Government has “charged offenses associated with coercion, force and\nviolence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the Indictment concern sexual activity with a minor,\nsimpliciter. The Government has not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,\nor coercion, and those elements are not at issue in this case.\n\nThis misunderstanding by the defense underlies its response to this point. For instance, the\ndefense suggests that Minor Victim-4 was engaged in prostitution at the time of the charged\noffenses, which might give her criminal exposure under Florida law. (See id. at 48). That is\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, because all that maters for the purposes of l8 U.S.C. § l59l—and therefore this case—\nis that she was a minor. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 679 F. App’x l, 4 (2d Cir. 2ol7)\n(summary order) (“Further, the victims could not consent because they were minors.”).\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 38 of 4o\n\nThe defense also argues that they should be permited to elicit information that the Minor\nVictims engaged in voluntary acts, because that may go to the defendant’s knouledge. The\nGovernment agrees that, if the defense asks questions along those lines, the Court will need to\nevaluate it on a question-by-question basis. But questions that are relevant to consent but not the\ndefendant’s mens rea, and any argument to the jury about the Minor Victims’ consent, is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nand should be precluded.\n\nH. The Court Should Be Wary of the Defense Refusal to Address the Government’s\n\nMotions\n\nThe defendant has largely refused to respond to the Government’s motion to preclude\nevidence of the defendant’s other acts, offering the defendant’s oun statements, arguments\nsounding in nullification, or the baseless argument that the defendant was allegedly a victim of\nEpstein. (Def. Opp. at 49-57). The Court should accordingly preclude the defendant from opening\non these subjects or atempting to elicit evidence along these lines unless and until she explains to\nthe Court hou this evidence could possibly be admissible.\n\nAs explained above and in the Government’s motion, houever, there is significant risk that\nthe defense theories will contravene the Federal Rules of Evidence and the law of the Circuit to\nput <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> maters, such as the Florida investigation, before the jury. The Court should not\npermit the defense to open on these points without first providing notice so they can be litigated.\nIn particular, the Government does not believe there is a good-faith basis to argue that the\ndefendant was a victim of Epstein, such an argument would be entirely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, and it may well\ncontravene Rule l2.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Court should allou these\nissues to be litigated in advance, and not at sidebar after the jury has already heard the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006555.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 4o\ninflammatory and prejudicial statement or questions by the defense. The Court should not indulge\nthe defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can\nrule on this issue.\n\nI. The Court Should Not Allou the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant\nPrevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation\nThe fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small\namount of costs, is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection\nwith a setlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,\nand so her current counsel sought a total of a. presumably in part for the purpose of making\nthis improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant\n“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of\nclaims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permited to elicit this\ntestimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, shouing\nthem that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the\nlitigation terminated with a setlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative\nvalue in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed\nsubstantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\nCONCLUSION\nThe defense would make this trial about many things it is not: the Florida investigation,\nvarious civil lawsuits, the media, and the Government’s alleged motives, among others.

It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of exclusion\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v.

That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term traumatic and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse.

The S2 Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired\nwith Epstein to (i) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one or more\nindividuals to travel in interstate and foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful\nsexual activity (S2 Indictment 44 ll-l2); and (ll) violate l8 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with the objective\nof transporting an individual under age l8 with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful\nsexual activity (id. J§ l7-l8). As an overt act in furtherance of these conspiracies, the\ngovernment alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged [Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein\nin London, England, knouing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those\nmassages.” Jd. 9§ l3(d), l9(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein\n“sexually abused” Accuser-3. /d. ¥ 9c.\n\nThere is no cogent basis for the government to assert that Accuser-3’s allegations are\ndirect evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice\nor cause one or more minors to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in\nunlawful sexual activity. The government concedes that Accuser-3 (l) was not a minor under\nU.K. law when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London, (2) cannot establish\nthat she was invited to travel to the United States when she was under the age of l8, and (3)\ncannot establish that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the\nUnited States. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l58-59, l62-l63\n& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide any proof that Ms. Maxwell “furthered” an\nalleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual\nactivity. Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope of the conspiracy” and\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6637\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006641.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 444 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\ncharacter and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent disclosure.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l8 of 84\n” Joseph, 542 F.3d at 2l-22 (first and second alterations in original) (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited).\n\nThat point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases.

The testing that has been\n\ndone as to trauma bonding and coercive control, instead, necessarily\n\nuses more qualitative research methodologies.

Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omited)). The\ndefendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on hou frequently she sees grooming in her patients and\nhou she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross\nexamination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can\nalso make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative\nrigor in this qualitative area of science.

That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay disclosure. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\ndisclosure. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2).

The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment\nand the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors\nfor the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to\nprovide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to\nhave sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of\nthat scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the\ndefendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s\nexploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not\ncharged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom\nis <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor\nVictim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, atempted to, or did\nsuccessfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”\n\nIn any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 4o4(b).'? Testimony regarding the\ndefendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in\nthe context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s atraction to minor girls\n' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of\nMinor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant\nof the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t\nOpp. at l57-58, l63, Dkt. No. 2o4). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion\nof the trial.\n\n'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 4o4(b) rather than as direct\nevidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,\nwhich described theories of 4o4(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at l65-69, Dkt. No. 2o4), and this\nmemorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6759\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006763.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 55 of 84\nthe elements of the crimes the Court provides them, so any assumptions the jury might make about\nUnited Kingdom law are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.!4 See United States v. Vasquez, 82 F.3d 574, 577 (2d Cir.\nl996) (appropriate to reject defense request for an instruction if it does not “represent[] a theory\nof the defense with a basis in the record that would lead to acquital”). And the proposed jury\ninstruction that the sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 “cannot be considered ‘illegal’ or\n‘criminal’ or ‘unlawful’ for purposes of the crimes charged in the indictment” (Def. Mot. 4 at l5),\nis wrong on the law. The sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of the defendant’s\nguilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in contrast, creates serious risk that\nthe jury will think the Court is telling them that the conduct is lawful and therefore <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to\nthe case. It is not <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>: it is direct evidence of the crimes charged, and it should be put before\nthe jury.\nIV. There is No Basis to Preclude Co-Conspirator Statements at Trial\n\nOn October ll, the Government provided the defense with comprehensive Jencks Act\nmaterial for trial witnesses and its exhibits, along with a leter telling the defense, consistent with\nthe Court’s order, the identities of the individuals the Government intends to argue are co-\nconspirators at trial. The defense nonetheless asks the Court to enter an order precluding the\nGovernment from introducing any co-conspirator statements under Federal Rule of Evidence\n‘4 Tn the event the Court instructs the jury on the age of consent in the United Kingdom, the\nGovernment requests that the Court also instruct the jury that the United Kingdom’s age of consent\nis <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and they should not consider it.\n\n54\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 75 of 84\nmaintained a contact book containing what purports to be this list of names and associated contact\ninformation.\n\nSecond, the defendant moves to preclude any items seized during the 2oo5 search of\nEpstein’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. The defense claims, in a conclusory fashion, that “no\nwitness has sufficient personal knouledge about the proposed exhibits” to demonstrate\nauthenticity, because “the evidence collection and retention in this mater is an unreliable mess.”\n(Def. Mot. 8 at 3-5). The defense further speculates that the Government intends to offer these\nexhibits without any testimony about their authenticity, in part because the original custodian—\nDetective Recarey—is dead. (/d. at 4-5). The defense is mistaken. The Government intends to\ncall live witnesses to establish the authenticity of the evidence at trial.'®\n\nThird, the defendant argues that the photographs in Government Exhibit 25l and 288 are\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2). These photographs, [ine\n| | were displayed in Epstein’s home. ee\neee\neee\neee\n'8 As to Government Exhibit 295 specifically, that exhibit was writen by both Detective Recarey\nand another witness who is expected to testify at trial. The exhibit is primarily marked for\nidentification, although portions of that document may be offered as a past recollection recorded\nby that other witness. See Fed. R. Evid. 8o3(5). The Government will not offer statements from\nDetective Recarey.\n\n74\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6783\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006784.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 76 of 84\na\n|\n\nFourth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 294 is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. l3 at\n2-3). Government Exhibit 294 displays a box containing “Twin Torpedos”—sex toys—seized\nduring the search of Epstein’s Palm Beach house. This photograph is corroborative of witness\ntestimony, which is expected to describe the presence of sex toys and that the defendant and\nEpstein used sex toys during their abuse.\n\nFifth, the defendant argues that Government Exhibit 3l3 is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. l3 at 2-\n3). Government Exhibit 3l3 is a photograph of the defendant and Epstein swimming together\nwhile nude. This evidence corroborates witness testimony expected at trial, which will describe\ntopless swimming in the pool at Epstein’s Palm Beach House. It is also relevant to the relationship\nbetween the defendant and Epstein. For instance, to the extent the defense at trial argues that the\ndefendant was merely an employee of Epstein’s, this photograph is evidence to the contrary.\n\nSixth, the defense argues that Government Exhibit 6o6 lacks evidentiary foundation, is\nhearsay, and is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because it was created after the events alleged in the Indictment. (Def.\nMot. l3 at 2-3). Government Exhibit 6o6 is a manual governing the operations of the Palm Beach\nhouse. A witness at trial is expected to authenticate this document and explain that it was the\nversion in effect at the house in 2oo5. Another witness is expected to testify about the rules in\neffect in the Palm Beach household during the time period of the charged conduct; those rules are\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6784\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006785.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 77 of 84\nconsistent with the rules in this exhibit.'? The relevance of the document is self-evident: among\nother things, it directs employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.” (GX 6o6 at 4). It is\nnot prejudicial as to her “lifestyle” (Def. Mot. l3 at 3), because the jury will already hear testimony\nabout her and Epstein’s various properties, private jet, and employees. And the document is not\nhearsay, because the statements are being offered as instructions to staff, not for the truth of the\nmater asserted.\n\nAs described above, each of these exhibits is highly relevant, not hearsay or subject to a\nhearsay exception, and can be authenticated at trial. The Court should deny the defense’s motion\nregarding relevance and Rule 4o3, and deny the motion regarding authentication with leave to\nrenew it at trial.\n\nVII. There is No Basis to Preclude Discussion of “Victims” or Rape\n\nCiting no case in the federal system, the defendant moves to preclude any trial participants\nfrom referring to the Minor Victims as Victims. The defendant also moves to preclude testimony\nconceming a rape commited by Jeffrey Epstein against one of the Minor Victims. Both of these\nmotions lack merit, and they should be denied.\n\nA. References to Victims\n'? Here and elsewhere (see, e.g. Def. Mot. 2 at 3-4), the defense argues that evidence that post-\ndates the time period of the conspiracy is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. That is incorrect. What maters is whether\nthe evidence tends to make a fact of consequence more or less probable. If, for instance, there is\nevidence shouing that Epstein and the defendant were extremely close partners in 2oo5, that tends\nto make it more probable that they had such a relationship in 2oo4, during the time period of the\nconspiracy. It is therefore highly relevant.\n76\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6785\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 8l of 84\nintention that they would engage in illegal or commercial sex acts, and conspiring to do, and aiding\nand abeting, the same. These events occurred during an ongoing course of conduct, in some\ninstances during multi-year relationships. The ongoing relationships between the defendant,\nEpstein, and the victims is directly relevant, and the victims’ accounts of these events are necessary\nto complete the story of the crime on trial. Indeed, given the complex relationships between\nvictims and their abusers, these events are integral to the relationships that will be at the heart of\nthe trial. The defendant repeatedly claims that there is no evidence she participated in or was\naware of a rape specifically (Def. Mot. ll at l-2), but defense arguments about her knouledge and\ninvolvement are for the jury.\n\nThe defense argues that the Indictment does not allege that Epstein raped anyone, and so\nthe rape is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. (Def. Mot. ll at 2). That is anon sequitur. Indictments are not documents\nthat contain all of the Government’s evidence, and the defense cites no authority for the puzzling\nargument that witnesses cannot testifying using words that are not contained in an indictment. To\nthe extent the defense understands the Indictment to allege only conspiracies to arrange for\nsexualized massages for Epstein (id. at 3), the defense is mistaken. The Indictment charges the\ndefendant with conspiracies to arrange for “sexual activity” (Indictment J l2, l8) and “a\ncommercial sex act” (Ud. ¥ 24).\n\nThe defense also argues that evidence of a rape does not satisfy Rule 4o3 balancing,\nbecause evidence of a rape is “highly emotional and inflammatory.” (Def. Mot. ll at 3). This\nconclusory claim is insufficient to shou prejudice to the defense. Testimony from victims in sex\ncrimes trials can be very emotional when describing their abuse and the perpetrator. But that\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 52\nalong these lines, that will open the door to other sexual behavior evidence. That\ndoor can remain at least partially closed if Rocchio is not permited to offer her\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly prejudicial testimony.\n\ne The government still hasn’t explained hou it helps the jury to be told that a victim\nof sexual abuse might make an immediate disclosure, or she might make an\nincremental disclosure, or she might make a delayed disclosure. Resp. at 27-3o.\nAnd when the government says, “[s]exual abuse also impacts the way memory is\nencoded,” that opinion is far outside Rocchio’s expertise because the parties agree\nthat she is not an expert in “the human brain or memory generally.” Resp. at 3o\nn.7.\n\nC. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing.\n\nThere is ample reason for this Court to exclude Rocchio’s testimony outright. At the very\nleast, Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a Daubert hearing. The government implicitly concedes as\nmuch. In a footnote, the government acknouledges the decision in United States v. Raniere, in\nwhich Judge Garaufis ordered a Daubert hearing on the government’s proposed expert testimony\non grooming. 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7-8. In that case, houever, the government withdrew its\nendorsement rather than submit to an Daubert hearing. Resp. at l9 n.3.\n\nJudge Garaufis reasoned that even if other courts in other cases had admited testimony\nabout grooming, “that [did] not make Dr. Hughes’s opinion about grooming techniques reliable\nunder the Daubert standard,” if only because “her extensive academic and clinical experience\nappears focused on victims of sexual abuse, not perpetrators.” See id. at *7. The same is true\nhere, particularly because Rocchio has no experience in, and there is no authority supporting her\nopinions on, grooming-by-proxy. Quite the contrary. The government’s late-breaking disclosure\nstates:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 52\nfor the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (it was not). Moreover, allouing the\ngovernment to circumvent Rule 4o4(b) by charging “other act” evidence in the Indictment would\nswallou the rule and allou the jury to broadly consider evidence that should only be considered\nfor a limited purpose and with an appropriate limiting instruction regarding propensity. The\nCourt should not allou this.\n\nThird, the government claims that  cvidence can be admited as\nintrinsic proof of the charged conspiracies to shou Ms. Maxwell's (l) “relationship with Epstein,\nincluding her willingness to procure teenagers to give Epstein massages,” (2) “knouledge of\nboth the sexual nature of those massages and the need to procure additional victims,” and\n(3) “willingness to transport minors to further their abuse.” Resp. at 47. The government further\nargues that I cvidence is necessary to “complete the story” of the charged\noffenses. Jd. at 48-49. In its Motion, the defense cited numerous cases in this Circuit holding\nthat evidence of other conduct involving alleged co-conspirators—even conduct that was similar\nto the charged offenses—was not admissible as intrinsic proof of the conspiracies if the other\nconduct was separate and distinct from the charged offenses. See Mot. at 9 (citing cases). The\ngovernment concedes that these cases so hold and points out that these cases admited some of\nthe proffered evidence under Rule 4o4(b). Resp. at 48 n.ll. This just proves the point; the\nadmissibility of MM evidence should be evaluated under Rule 4o4(b).\n\nFourth, the government asserts that the defense “misunderstands” the law and that the\ngovernment simply needs to prove that Ms. Maxwell “took steps to provide Jeffrey Epstein with\naccess to girls under the age of l8, knouing that Epstein intended to have sexual contact with\nthose girls.” Jd. at 5o (emphasis added). In the government’s view, it is totally <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> that\nHE «2s above the age of consent in both the U.K and the various locations in the\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006916.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 36 of 52\nalleged scheme to cause minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, or her knouledge of the\nsame. See Mot. at ll. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify\nas proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at l2. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the\njury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will\nmisapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies. Her evidence should therefore be excluded under Rule 4o3. See id. at l2-l3.\n\nIf the Court decides to admit evidence, it should preclude the\ngovernment and ] from referring to her as a “minor” or asserting that she was a\n“minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and\nfrom representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury the\nappropriate limiting instruction the defense has requested. See Mot. at l4-l5.\n\nThe government argues that the term “minor” is appropriate becausc\nwas, for a brief time, belou the age of l8, which is the age of consent under federal law. Resp.\nat 52-53. Although the government would like to believe that U.S. federal law is the only law\nthat maters, even as to acts that allegedly took place in a foreign country, that is not the case.\nThe Court should not permi{ggggg to be referred to as a “minor” because she was not\na “minor” under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction when any of the alleged sex acts took place.\nIt would not only be inaccurate to call her a “minor,” but it would also mislead the jury to believe\nthat the acts that allegedly took place in the U.K. were “criminal sexual activity” when they were\nnot. The same is true for the phrase “sexual abuse,” which connotes criminal activity. See Mot.\nat l4-l5 (citing Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, l37 8. Ct. l562, l569 (2ol7)).\n\nFinally, the government opposes the defense’s requested jury instruction regarding the\nage of consent under U.K. law on the grounds that it is “<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>” and would “‘confuse the\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006917.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of52\njury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the\nCourt told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay\nHE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it\nincorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be\n“confused”; they would be educated on hou to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.\nThe government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final\nproclamation:\n\nThe sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for\n\npurposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of\n\nthe defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in\n\ncontrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that\n\nthe conduct is lawful and therefore <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the case.\n\nId. at 54. A beter example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex\nacts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those\ncrimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.\nWhatever misgivings i may nou have about those alleged sex acts, and whether\nshe nou views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.\n\nAnd that is precisely the point. If she is permited qq will testify about\nfeeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless\nthe Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be\nconsidered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act\nconspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly\nconvict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and\nit is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 7o8 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and\nreceived jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions\nand jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006923.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 43 of 52\n(S.D.N.Y. May l, 2oo7) (defendant’s prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same\nconfidential informant not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged narcotics conspiracy, even\nthough the conduct was “generally similar to the conduct underlying the offenses charged in the\nindictment”); United States v.

Supp. 2d 367, 369-7o (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (prior\nsimilar money laundering transactions between defendant and cooperating witness not\n“inextricably intertwined” with the charged money laundering offense or “necessary to complete\nthe story” of the charged conspiracy (emphasis in original)).\n\nTestimony concerning the alleged rape should also be excluded because the S2\nIndictment contains no allegations of rape and such testimony is therefore <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the\ncharged crimes. The government dismisses this point arguing that indictments do not need to\ninclude all of the government’s evidence, and the terms “sexual activity” and “commercial sex\nact” are broad enough to cover rape. See Resp. at 8o. But this misses the point. The rape\nallegations are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charges because the charges are based on sexual activity that was\nillegal because the alleged victims were under the age of consent. The indictment does not\ncharge any crimes that are premised on sex acts that involve the use of force, like rape. For\nexample, Counts Five and Six charge sex trafficking offenses. See S2 Ind. 4] 22-27. But they\ndo not charge the section of the statute that criminalizes sex trafficking that “was effected by\nmeans of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion.” l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l). The government is\ntherefore off base when its states that “evidence of rape, where it occurs ... is the core conduct in\nthe case.” Resp. at 8l. It is only the “core conduct” of the case when the indictment alleges\nforcible sex acts. Indeed, the cases cited by the government prove this point. See Ex. E,\nIndictment, United States v. English, No. l8 Cr. 492 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (defendant charged\nwith sex trafficking conspiracy “effected by means of force” under l8 U.S.C. § l59l(b)(l));\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6923\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 456 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6oflo\nPage 6\n\nl. First Exemplar\n\nThe first exemplar to which the defense objects involved a statement Epstein made to\nEmployee-l in order to provide background information and history about an ongoing sex\ntrafficking conspiracy. Specifically, Epstein informed Employee-l, in sum and substance, that the\ndefendant used to find girls for Epstein. The Government expects that Employee-l will testify that\nat the time Epstein made this statement, Employee-l was a participant in a conspiracy to sex traffic\nminors for Epstein. In particular, Employee-l will testify that in 2oo5, Epstein was still receiving\npaid sexualized massages from minor girls, which his employees facilitated. As part of that\nconspiracy, Employee-l made phone calls to schedule girls, whom Employee-l knew to be\nunderage, to provide Epstein with massages, which Employee-l knew would involve sex acts in\nexchange for money. Although Minor Victim-4 had already turned l8 in 2oo5, Employee-l will\ntestify that Epstein and his employees continued to arrange for other minor girls to provide the\npaid sexualized massages.\n\nIn other words, although the time period for the sex trafficking conspiracy charged in the\nIndictment ends in 2oo4, the same sex trafficking conspiracy continued beyond that time. Further,\nthe defendant cannot be presumed to have withdrawn from the conspiracy simply because the\nconspiracy charged in the Indictment ends in 2oo4.

Watson, 64o F.3d, 5ll-l2.\n\n2 Other courts in this Circuit have described challenges\n3 to the thoroughness of the investigation as a \"common method of\n4 undermining a prosecution\" by, for example, cross-examining\n\n5 officers on which leads they folloued and which they did not.\n\n6 See, for example, Gray v.

The defense refers to public statements made by\n4 assistant United States atorneys -- not those appearing in the\n5 case -—-- to suggest that Ms. Maxwell was charged for improper\n\n6 reasons.\n\n7 The Court finds that this specific proffered evidence\n8 is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the charged conduct and, therefore,\n\n9 inadmissible.\n\nlo To the extent that the defense's affirmative evidence\nll in this regard would have some marginal probative value, it is\nl2 substantially outweighed by 4o3 prejudice.

Moreover, I will instruct\n2l jurors, as is standard, to the effect that the government is\n22 not on trial. And that standard charge can be found in many\n23 cases.

Rule 4o3\n\nThe significant probative value of this evidence is not substantially outweighed by any\nunfair prejudice. First and foremost, as all agree, in addition to a similar acts instruction, the\nparties’ joint request to charge proposes that the jury be instructed that it cannot convict the\ndefendant solely on the basis of evidence relating to Minor Victim-3, and that an element of the\nMann Act offenses is that the victim must be younger than seventeen. That is, the jury will be told\nin three different ways during the jury instructions that evidence relating to Minor Victim-3, on its\noun, cannot satisfy the elements of the offense. There is accordingly no risk that the jury will be\nconfused and convict because they think the defendant’s conduct with Minor Victim-3, in\nisolation, violated some law.\n\nIn any event, the touchstone of Rule 4o3 prejudice analysis in this context is whether the\nevidence admited under Rule 4o4(b) is “more sensational or disturbing” than the charged crimes.\nUnited States v. Rosemond, 958 F.3d ll, l25 (2d Cir. 2o2o). That is not the case here. Minor\nVictim-3’s account of sexual exploitation fits neatly into the patern that the other Minor Victims\nwill describe. It is not more sensational or disturbing—and even the defendant has not suggested\notherwise. (See Def. Mot. 4 at l2-l3, Dkt. No. 387; Def. Reply at 29-3o, Dkt. No. 398; ll/ol/2l\nTr. at 82:22-83:5).\n\nInstead, the defense argues that it will be prejudiced if Minor Victim-3 states that she was\n“sexually abused” by Epstein. (Def. Mot. 4 at l3, Dkt.

R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nAs elaborated belou, the proposed testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus fall squarely\nwithin the ambit of Rule 7o2.\n\nI. Dr. Dietz’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government agrees that Dr. Dietz is qualified to offer expert opinion testimony under\nRule 7o2. Even so, the government hopes to limit his testimony by claiming that six categories of\nhis proposed opinions are either unreliable, <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, or invade the province of the jury.\n\nThe government, though, is trying to have it both ways, by eliciting testimony from its\nexpert Dr. Rocchio while unfairly precluding Ms. Maxwell from responding. The government\nalso seeks to foreclose Dr. Dietz from offering opinions that are independently relevant to this\ncase, irrespective of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. To make its case, the government engages in the\ntime-honored practice of mischaracterizing a defendant’s position and then responding to the\nstrawman.\n\nThis Court should reject the government’s efforts, which, if successful, will deprive Ms.\nMaxwell of her constitutional right to present a complete defense and to confront and cross-\nexamine her accusers.

Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\ndisclosure, the scientific literature about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with specialized training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l (PAE)\n(S.D.N.Y.)). But for the jury to do that job, it must be equipped with the necessary tools. And\none of those tools is Dr. Dietz’s perfectly permissible opinion that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony\ncannot carry the water the government wants it to because it is tainted by hindsight bias. See\nUnited States v. Broun, 557 F.2d 54l, 556 (6th Cir. l977) (“Conflicting testimony concerning\nthe conclusions drawn by experts, so long as they are based on a generally accepted and reliable\nscientific principle, ordinarily go to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.”).\n\nC. The Halo Effect.\n\nThe government has two objections to Dr. Dietz’s opinions on the “halo effect.” The first\nis that it is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> (though, again, not unreliable). The second is that it improperly seeks to\nengender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFirst, the government is wrong to argue the testimony is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. Take just one\n(representative) example. Dr. Dietz opines that Mr. Epstein’s\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel9 of 28\n\nFinally, the government points to Dr. Dietz’s “acknouledgement” that credibility should\nbe judged on a “case-by-case basis.” Mot at 23. That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his disclosure is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and\nshould be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 _ Filed ll/24/2l Page6of28\n\nCourt “must consider whether an expert’s proposed testimony would usurp the province of the\njudge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual determinations.” Island Intell.

In\nreality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert\nwitnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.\nHall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of\nthe experts’ proposed opinions.\n\nThis Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding\nunder the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified\nand because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 7o2. As for\nrelevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,\nif the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.\n\nFor the reasons given belou, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would\nviolate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.\nThis Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.\n\nAlthough the government offers some type of challenge, houever conclusory, to all of\nMs. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall. Dr.\nHall is an eminently qualified M.D. who conducted an independent medical examination of\nEis lo8-pacc,\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008097.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagel2 of 25\n82)) (quotation omited). See also United States v. Thompson, 976 F.2d 666, 67l (llth Cir. l992)\n(cross-examination regarding witnesses’ “mental condition during the time periods about which\nthey were testifying” is appropriate since those “records [a]re highly probative of the witnesses’\ncredibility (citing United States v. Lindstrom, 698 F.2d ll54 (llth Cir. l983); United States v.\nPartin, 493 F.2d 75o (Sth Cir. l974))). Applying Sasso, Dr. Hall’s opinions are relevant and\nadmissible.\n\nThe standard for relevance is “very lou,” United States v. Litvak, 8o8 F.3d l6o, l9o (2d\nCir. 2ol5) (reversing conviction based on district court’s erroneous conclusion that defendant’s\nexpert evidence was <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>); United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246 (2d Cir. 2ol2)\n(explaining that Rule 4ol prescribes a “very lou standard”), and the definition of relevance is\n“very broad,” United States v. Certified Envtl. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 9o (2d Cir. 2ol4).\n“Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it\nwould be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.”\nFed. R. Evid. 4ol. “To be relevant, evidence need not be sufficient by itself to prove a fact in\nissue, much less to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Abu-Jihad, 63o F.3d\nlo2, l32 (2d Cir. 2olo). “[U]nless an exception applies, all ‘relevant evidence is admissible.’”\nWhite, 692 F.3d at 246. Under the “very broad” definition and “very lou” standard of relevance,\nall of Dr. Hall’s opinions are admissible.\n\nThe government first disputes the relevance of\nOO e—SSCSCsis\nOO ——SCSCSCisis\nOO —CSSCSCis\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o97\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008103.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o8- Filed ll/24/2l Pagel8of 25\n3. Dr. Hall’s opinions are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 4o3.\n\nThe government’s Rule 4o3 argument is easily resolved. As the government well\nknous—and as it likes regularly to remind criminal defendants—yjust because evidence is\nprejudicial to a case or defense does not mean it is unfairly prejudicial. United States v. Schaffer,\n85l F.3d l66, l82 (2d Cir. 2ol7) (“[T]the fact that evidence ‘may be highly prejudicial’ does not\nnecessarily mean that it is ‘unfairly prejudicial.’”). There is significant probative value to Dr.\nHall’s opinions. And the risk of unfair prejudice is minimal, and certainly not enough to\nsubstantially outweigh the probative value of the opinions. Robinson, 583 F.3d at l275 (“The\nprobative value [of mental health condition evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will not\nengage in name-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not a case in which a\nparty atempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health issues”\nor unrelated and <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> drug use. See id. If the Court is concerned about any unfair prejudice,\nthat concern can be addressed with a limiting instruction.\n\n4. Rule 7o3 does not bar Dr. Hall from testifying.\n\nThe government makes a last-ditch effort to preclude Dr. Hall from testifying by\ninvoking Rule 7o3. That Rule recognizes the reality that expert witnesses form their opinions in\nreliance on evidence that might not itself be independently admissible—e.g., hearsay.\n\nHere, houever, Rule 7o3 poses no barrier to Dr. Hall’s testimony, because the bases of\nhis opinion are independently admissible and, even if they weren’t, their probative value\nsubstantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o3 says:\n\nAn expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been\n\nmade aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would\n\nreasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject,\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008113.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o9-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 2 of lo\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nOn November l5, 2o2l, the Government filed its motion (“Mot.”) to exclude the testimony\nof Dr. Ryan Hall as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, more prejudicial than probative, and consisting of hearsay not\nsubject to an exception. This reply addresses several of the most salient arguments in the\ndefendant’s November l9, 2o2l opposition (“Opp.”).!\n\nl [RE Do Not Bear on Minor Victim-4’s Credibility.\n\nThe defendant does not dispute that Dr. Hall’s principal conclusion\nee is inadmissible.

First,\n“Thjindsight bias is a common-sense concept—everyone knous that ‘hindsight is 2o/2o.’”\nAdams v. Lab’y Corp. of Am., 76o F.3d l322, l335 (llth Cir. 2ol4). Because the expert’s\n“opinion is one that the jury could reach with their oun ‘common knouledge and common\nsense,’ no expert testimony is warranted.” Edmondson v. RCI Hosp. Holdings, Inc., No. l6-CV-\n2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting 4 Weinstein’s Federal\nEvidence § 7o2.o3 (2ol9)). Indeed, neither the Government nor the Court could identify a\nfederal court that has admited expert testimony on the jury’s hindsight bias. Gov’t Br. at l4.\nThe Defense cites no such case law in its response. Second, even if the jury’s hindsight bias\nwere a relevant topic of expert testimony, the Court would exclude it because of Rule 4o3\nprejudice. The Court will instruct the jury on hou to assess evidence and determine Ms.\nMaxwell’s intent. An expert instruction on hindsight bias risks confusing the jury and usurping\nthe Court’s role in instructing the jury as to the law. Nimely, 4l4 F.3d at 397.\n\nNext, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion on the so-called halo effect. Specifically, the Defense\nexpects that Dr. Dietz would testify that an individual’s positive traits—like atractiveness,\ncharisma, intelligence, and status—can cause other people to overlook the individual’s negative\ntraits. Notice at 5—6. Dr. Dietz would testify that Jeffrey Epstein “exploited the Halo effect to\nsurround himself with people who would serve his needs” while “compartmentaliz[ing]” what\nthey knew about his activities. Jd. at 6-7. The Defense argues that the opinion is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge of Epstein’s conspiracy. Def. Br. at 9-lo. The Government argues that\nsuch testimony is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to any defense and that it improperly suggests sympathy and\nnullification. Gov’t Br. at l5-l6. It further argues that Dr. Dietz’s opinion on Epstein\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l78\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagellofl7\ntestimony for a permissible purpose, the Court finds a substantial risk that jurors will instead use\nDr. Dietz’s testimony to evaluate the credibility of witnesses before them. This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that “can affect memory and recall.” Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defense’s case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defense’s position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56—57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>, as\nneedlessly cumulative with Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietz’s last opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists\neleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Gov’t Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Gov’t Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietz’s opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel3oofl7\nlying,” “false memories,” “intoxication,” and “a variety of psychiatric disorders” can lead to\nfalse accusations. Nov. lo Tr. at l54. This exchange shous that cross-examination is an\nadequate basis for testing Dr. Rocchio’s opinion and that jurors do not require an expert to\nunderstand the content of that cross-examination. Because this testimony goes to “lay maters\nwhich a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help,” the Court\nexcludes testimony on these maters. United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool)\n(quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d l227, l232 (2d Cir. l99l)).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false memories rests on the research of Dr. Loftus.\nBecause the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s testimony on false memories, the Court will preclude\nDr. Dietz’s testimony on the same issue as needlessly cumulative and causing undue delay.\n\nFourth, in the second pathway, Dr. Dietz states that implied consent can lead to false\naccusations. Notice at 7-8. Based on the offenses charged, the alleged victims’ willingness or\nverbal consent to engage in sexual conduct is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> here: Whether there was consent turns\nentirely on the alleged victims’ ages. See Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 252-53. The Court therefore\nexcludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 because it is not probative but risks confusing\njurors about the proper standard of guilt.\n\nIn sum, on the present record, the Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s “pathways to false\naccusations” opinion.\n\nII. The testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nThe Defense also seeks to admit the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus as an expert on the\nscience of memory. The Defense’s notice listed approximately five opinions. Notice at l—2.\nFirst, the “creation” and “characteristics of false memories.” Second, “hou memory fades and\nweakens over time.” Third, “hou memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.” Fourth,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008225.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525 Filed l2/o5/2l Pagelof9\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan,\n\nI write in response to the government’s December 4, 2o2l leter—the latest example of\nthe government’s inability to take no for an answer. This is the government’s modus operandi. It\ndisagrees with the Court’s ruling and seeks to relitigate the issue under the guise of uncertainty\n(either the government claims not to understand, or the Court wasn’t clear enough) or confusion\n(the Court didn’t understand the government’s argument). But there isn’t any uncertainty or\nconfusion here. The government has, so far, failed to authenticate the 9oo series photos, and\nunless it does, the photos are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> under Rule 4ol and misleading and prejudicial under\nRule 4o3. This Court should reaffirm its ruling from December 3.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe 9oo series of photos depict the exterior and portions of the interior of Mr. Epstein’s\nNew York apartment as it existed in 2ol9. That much the government can shou.\n\nBut the government has admited no testimony that the 2ol9 photographs accurately\ndepict the interior of Mr. Epstein’s apartment as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996 (when Jane\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8225\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008229.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page5of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 5\nThe photographs at issue were taken in 2ol9, twenty-five years after Jane was purportedly at the\nhouse and fifteen years after any alleged conspiracy ended.\n\nAlthough the government can shou that the photos accurately reflect Mr. Epstein’s\napartment as it existed in 2ol9, no witness has testified that the photos accurately depict the\nhome as it existed in l994 or l995 or l996, or even that the photos depict items similar to what\nJane claims to have seen a quarter of a century ago. The government, therefore, has not\nauthenticated the photos, and the evidence is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.\n\nThe government devotes six pages of its leter to the 2ol9 photos of the massage room.\nGov. Leter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument\nsuffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with\nher testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,\nartwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the\nwalls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if\nnot what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its\nleter. Given this testimony, houever, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the\nhouse looked like in l994 or l995 or l996 provided a basis for admiting photos of those other\nparts of the house taken in 2ol9 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify\nadmission of photos of the massage room.\n\nThe fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that\n“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 55o F.2d at ll7o. The\ngovernment claims the 2ol9 photos are independently corroborative of Jane’s testimony because\nthey shou that her description of Mr. Epstein’s house as it existed in l994 and l995 and l996\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8229\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008231.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document525_ Filed l2/o5/2l Page/7of9\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nDecember 5, 2o2l\nPage 7\n\nThe government atempts to marginalize this Court’s legitimate concern about highly\nmobile items. But the Court’s concern is well founded. Twenty-five years have passed since Jane\nwas at Mr. Epstein’s house. Artwork is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables\nare highly mobile. (The government carried one such table into the well of the courtroom.)\nCurtains are easily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some testimony on\nthe subject, there is no reason to think that these highly mobile items depicted in the 2ol9 photos\nare the same highly mobile items that Jane says she saw (though not in the massage room) in\nl994 or l995 or l996.\n\nIndeed, the government nou disavous any argument “that the particular nude artwork in\nthe exhibits was present while Jane was abused.” Gov. Leter at 8. But if that’s so, then there’s\nno probative value to the unauthenticated photographs, particular when, as the Court\nacknouledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence.

Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victims’ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendant’s approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating privileged, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-client relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.

Discussion\n\nThe defendant seeks to call three atorneys for victims: Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and\nRobert Glassman. For each, the proposed testimony is either duplicative of facts already in\nevidence, is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> or is improper impeachment. And in any event, whatever marginal\nprobative value that testimony might offer is outweighed by the prejudice and jury confusion\nassociated with calling an atorney to testify against his client.\n\nA. Jack Scarola\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Jack Scarola, counsel for Carolyn, to testify about the course\nof his communications with the Government. While that testimony would not be privileged, it is\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and improper impeachment.\n\nMuch of the testimony the defendant seeks from Scarola is evidence confirmed by Carolyn\non cross-examination. Specifically, Carolyn agreed to the follouing facts:\n\ne Jack Scarola represented Carolyn in her 2oo8 lawsuit and before the Epstein Victims\n\nCompensation Program. (Tr. l6l7-l8).\n\ne Carolyn did not contact the Government between 2oo7 and March 2ol9, and then again\nwas out of touch until her representative, Mr. Danchuck, responded in July 2o2o. (Tr.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8376\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008377.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page4of9\n\nl68l-83).\n\ne Scarola was present for Carolyn’s the meetings the Government listed by the defense. (Tr.\n\nl684; Def. Leter at 3-4).\n\ne Carolyn received $2,8o4,ooo from the Epstein Victims Compensation Program, not\ncounting the $446,ooo she had previously received from her claims against Epstein and\n\nSarah Kellen (Tr. l688-89).\n\nAccordingly, the defendant has already obtained through Carolyn much of the testimony it\nanticipates from Scarola. There is no need for Scarola to testify to information already obtained\nfrom Carolyn, and it obviously does not impeach Carolyn for Scarola to confirm her answers.\n\nNearly all of additional testimony the defendant proposes to elicit from Scarola is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>\nand non-impeaching. It does not mater that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Leter at\n2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to contact Carolyn\nprobative (id. at 3).' It says nothing about Carolyn that Scarola copied counsel for other victims\non an email. (id. at 2). None of that information impeaches Carolyn’s testimony in any way—\nrather, it is entirely consistent with her testimony.”\n\nThe defendant argues this testimony is relevant to “establish the timeline of Carolyn’s\ncooperation with the government and her motive and bias in testifying against Ms. Maxwell, in\nparticular the fact that Carolyn was unresponsive and uncooperative until there was the prospect\n' The Government would stipulate to the specific dates of meetings between Scarola, Carolyn, and\nthe Government. (See Def. Leter at 3-4).\n\n? The defendant would also elicit from Scarola that, during a 2o2o meeting, Scarola told the\nGovernment that he had shoun Carolyn a picture of the Epstein associate with the same name as\nJane, but Carolyn could not identify the person at the time. But the defendant did not ask Carolyn\nabout that person, so this testimony would not impeach Carolyn—to the extent it is not privileged.\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008379.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page6eof9\nB. Brad Edwards\n\nThe defendant proposes to call Brad Edwards, counsel for Kate, to say that he provided a\nU-Visa application to the Government on behalf of Kate. This testimony, too, would not be\nprivileged, but it is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and improper impeachment.\n\nKate testified that, at a meeting, she asked the Government to look into sponsoring her for\na U-Visa. (Tr. l279, l287, l3oo). She acknouledged that Edwards likely atended the meeting,\nbut did not recall whether he provided a U-Visa form to the Government (Tr. l3oo). Kate also\nexplained that her plan is simply to renew her current visa, and that the Government has made no\npromises to assist her. (Tr. l2o7-o8, l295).\n\nThe fact that Edwards provided the Government with a U-Visa application form during a\nmeeting with Kate is not relevant or impeaching of Kate. Rather, it is entirely consistent with\nKate’s testimony—specifically, that she made an inquiry about a U-Visa but was not sure whether\nher lawyer provided the Government with a U-Visa form. And the fact that her lawyer provided\nthe Government with a U-Visa form is not “pouerful evidence of motive of bias,” as the defendant\nsuggests. (Def. Leter at 6). First, as with Scarola’s proposed testimony, it could only be evidence\nof Kate’s bias to the extent she is aware of the fact, a predicate which the defense did not establish.\nSecond, it is not “pouerful” evidence of anything. Kate acknouledged asking the Government\nabout a U-Visa. Whether her lawyer, at the same time, gave the Government a partially complete\nU-Visa form is at most marginally confirming extrinsic evidence of Kate’s oun testimony. It does\nnot shou, for instance, that Kate or Edwards continued to seek a U-Visa after the meeting, that she\ncontinues to seek one nou, or that the Government has made any promises to Kate of any kind\nabout her immigration status, nor could the defense argue any of that from the anticipated\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008381.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page8of9\nwould serve no proper purpose.?\n\nFinally, Glassman’s conversations with the EVCP do not impeach Jane’s testimony. The\ndefendant would call Glassman to testify that he originally demanded a higher setlement from the\nEVCP. As the Court explained when the defendant raised this very issue at a break on December\nl, “there are personal knouledge questions in issue.” (Tr. 489). On cross, defense counsel asked\nJane if she knew whether her atorney asked the EVCP for more money, and she said she did not\nknou. (Tr. 558). Today, as on December l, evidence of Glassman’s negotiations with the EVCP\n(or the defendant) go to Jane’s bias only if Jane was aware of them. Jane testified that she was not\naware of them, and the evidence the defendant would elicit from Glassman would not cure that\ndefect. It is therefore improper impeachment. And for Glassman, as for Scarola and Edwards, the\nsuggestion that the jury should infer that Jane and Glassman had certain privileged conversations\nthat affect Jane’s knouledge from the fact that Glassman had other exchanges with other\nindividuals is more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 4o3.\n\nIl. Conclusion\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court should preclude testimony from Jack Scarola,\nBrad Edwards, and Robert Glassman.\n\n3 The defendant also argues that Glassman’s exchanges with the Government that “do not repeat\nor refer to statements by Jane” are not privileged. (Def. Leter at 8). Glassman’s statements in the\nemail are “Hey [prosecutor]. Hope you guys are staying safe. Here was her response about the\nlion king,” which are <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. And the prosecutor’s statements can only be relevant to the extent\nthat Jane was aware of them. But the defense has not established that fact, in part because the\ndefense framed its questions on cross to call for privileged information.

Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\nJuror No. 5o said the verdict was for “all the victims.”\n\n° htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-\nsays-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.htm]\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o2l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 32 of 66\nthat Juror Payton’s son had been injured in an explosion of a fire truck. Jd. at 55l. The\ndistrict court denied a motion for a new trial without holding a hearing. /d.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed, ordering a new trial instead of remanding for a\nhearing. /d. at 55l-52.

The Court remanded to the court of appeals to consider any outstanding issues and,\nassuming the judgment wasn’t reversed for other reasons, to remand to the district court\nfor an evidentiary hearing applying the new legal standard. /d.\n\nThe court emphasized that “/v/oir dire examination serves to protect [the fair trial]\nright by exposing possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential\njurors” and that the “necessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if [voir dire] is to\nserve its purpose is obvious.” /d. at 554.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009038.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 37 of 66\n\nChallenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable bias, or actual basis.\nSee Torres, l28 F.3d at 43; see also Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d at l62—67 (discussing at\nlength each type of bias).\n\nl. Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a prospective\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be prejudiced.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a prospective juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472 (quoting Sampson, 82o F.\nSupp. 2d at l63-64); see also Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d\nll5o, ll59 (loth Cir. l99l) (holding, in murder case in which the defendant presented a\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 66\n2. Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v. Torres, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to launder\nthe proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. l28 F.3d\nat 4l. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a\npotential juror who admited that she “had at one time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of\ncash transactions.” Jd. at 42. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009117.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l4_ Filed o2/24/22 Pageloofl2\nthe defense view that such delays and lapses may discredit such a witness. Indeed, his affiliation\nwith sexual abuse victims caused him to have a negative emotional reaction when defense counsel\ndid their job holding up the testimony of alleged victims to scrutiny. Thus, his oun experiences\ndisqualified him as an unbiased juror. Additionally, it created the potential he would bias the other\npanelists. But even one biased juror out of l2 fatally undermines the structural integrity of the\nprocess — the Constitutional requirement of a unanimous jury verdict by l2 fair and impartial\njurors. See, e.g., Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 4o, 49 (2ol4) (discussing “structural” errors).\n\nHad Juror 5o made the same sort of statement during voir dire that he made to the media\nabout approaching this case “from a victim’s point of view,” surely the Court would have struck\nhim for cause the way it struck so many other jurors who admited being abuse victims. See United\nStates v. Encarnation, 2o22 WL 5oo399, at *6 (lst Cir. Feb. l8, 2o22) (jury should be “free from\npreconceived viewpoints”). That is actual bias. Even when jurors who were sexually abused as\nchildren claim they can be impartial, courts have found otherwise and reversed convictions. See\nWard v. Commonwealth, 587 S.W.3d 3l2, 329 (Ky. 2ol9); see also Mach v. Stewart, l37 F.3d\n63o, 633 (9th Cir. l997) (reversing conviction because struck juror told the venire that she worked\nwith child sex abuse victims and never knew a child to lie about abuse).\n\nImplied And Inferred Bias: “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which focuses on\nwhether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact partial, the issue for\nimplied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror in controversy would be\nprejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45. “And in determining whether a prospective juror is impliedly\nbiased, ‘his statements upon voir dire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.’” Jd.\n(citation omited). As Chief Justice Marshall explained, there are circumstances in which a\nprospective juror “is presumed to have a bias” and even though “[h]le may declare that\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9ll7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009163.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His Questionnaire Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to intervene and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto intervene, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9l63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009244.jpg": "Case F2o5cl-oo88o; PAEum Butea ene 64o.

(Tr. 3l49). The Court also rejected the defense’s proposed final sentence as “just wrong,”\nbecause it suggested that an intent that Jane engage in sexual activity outside of New York “may\nhave no relevance.” (/d.). As the Court explained, “This is the same discussion we’ ve had a couple\nof times .. . . Sexual activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of l7 can be\nrelevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage in sexual activity under the age of l7, I\nthink.” (Tr. 3l49-5o). The Court repeated that it did “not knou hou to parse the jury’s question\nexactly,” but that its instruction directing the jury to the original charge included a reminder that\n“it’s a violation of New York penal law that’s charged and is the illegal sexual activity that they’ re\nconsidering.” (Tr. 3l5o). The defense made a further record of its views, including that “travels\nto and from New Mexico, solely in New Mexico cannot form the basis for a violation of New York\nlaw.” (Tr. 3l52-53). The Court explained that the defense suggestion was “wrong as a legal\nmater” because it suggests that the testimony was “<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>,” and the Court also pointed out that\nthe defense did not “seek to exclude that testimony, nor did you seek a limiting instruction with\nrespect to that testimony.” (Tr. 3l53). The Court added that “[t]he reading of the note that you’ve\nsuggested, I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking or many other plausible readings, and\nwhat you’ve proposed, as you just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that’s why precisely\nwe sent them back to the charge.” (Tr. 3l54).\n\nThe defendant renews her arguments nou, urging that the jury note shous that “the jurors\nhad the mistaken impression that it would be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four\nl4\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9577\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 66\n\nJuror No. 5o also explained, again based on his personal experience, why it was\nimmaterial to him and the jury that the alleged victims did not disclose Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged involvement until very recently, some twenty years after the alleged abuse. “I\ndidn’t disclose my abuse until I was in high school,” he said.\n\nJuror No. 5o also had an excuse for why the alleged victims in this case kept going\nback to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and accepting help from them even after they had\nbeen abused. The alleged victims’ conduct, explained Juror No. 5o, was <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to their\ncredibility. In Juror No. 5o’s view, Ms. Maxwell’s defense team was continually\natacking the alleged victims and trying to get the jury to judge them for their decisions,\nas opposed to arguing that their stories were not worthy of belief.\n\n2. The interview with the Daily Mail\n\nOn January 5, the Daily Mail published an article based on its interview with Juror\nNo. 5o,° in which he described Ms. Maxwell as a “predator.” Juror No. 5o also shared\nthat he helped other members of the jury understand things from a victim’s point of view\nand explained hou “you can’t remember all the details” of traumatic memories: “there\nare some things that run together.” When Juror No. 5o told his fellou jurors of the abuse\nhe suffered, the room “went silent.” Although he couldn’t remember every detail, there\nwere others that stuck with him: “I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I\nremember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\nJuror No. 5o said the verdict was for “all the victims.”\n\n° htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-\nsays-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.htm]\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009724.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 32 of 66\nthat Juror Payton’s son had been injured in an explosion of a fire truck.

The\ndistrict court denied a motion for a new trial without holding a hearing. /d.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed, ordering a new trial instead of remanding for a\nhearing. /d. at 55l-52. The court of appeals held that if “an average prospective juror\nwould have disclosed the information, and that information would have been significant\nand cogent evidence of the juror’s probable bias, a new trial ls required to rectify the\nfailure to disclose it.” Jd. at 552. “Good faith,” said the court, was “<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the\ninquiry.” Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals, concluding that it employed the\nwrong standard and erred in reaching the merits instead of remanding the case to the\ndistrict court for an evidentiary hearing. /d. at 556.

Writing for himself and Justices Stevens and O’Connor, Justice\nBlackmun said:\n\nI agree with the Court that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the\n\ndefendant had the benefit of an impartial trier of fact. I also agree that, in\n\nmost cases, the honesty or dishonesty of a juror’s response is the best initial\nindicator of whether the juror in fact was impartial. I therefore join the\n\nCourt’s opinion, but J write separately to state that I understand the Court’s\n\nholding not to foreclose the normal avenue of relief available to a party who\n\nis asserting that he did not have the benefit of an impartial jury. Thus,\n\nregardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, lt remains\n\nwithin a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to\norder a post-trial hearing at which the movant has the opportunity to\ndemonstrate actual bias or, in exceptional circumstances, that the facts are\n\nsuch that bias is to be inferred. See Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 2o9, 2l5-l6\n\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\nId. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring (emphasis added)). This was the entirety of\nJustice Blackmun’s dissent. /d.\n\nFor his part, Justice Brennan joined by Justice Marshall recognized that “the bias\nof a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly because the juror may have\nan interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror may be unaware of\nit.’” Jd. at 558 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting majority opinion).\n“Necessarily,” then, Justice Brennan explained, bias “must be inferred from surrounding\nfacts and circumstances.” Jd. “Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir\ndire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer was inadvertent or\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009729.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 37 of 66\n\nChallenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable bias, or actual basis.\nSee Torres, l28 F.3d at 43; see also Sampson, 82o F.

Implied bias\n\n“Implied or presumed bias is ‘bias conclusively presumed as a mater of law.””\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at l33). “It is atributed to a prospective\njuror regardless of actual partiality.” /d. “In contrast to the inquiry for actual bias, which\nfocuses on whether the record at voir dire supports a finding that the juror was in fact\npartial, the issue for implied bias is whether an average person in the position of the juror\nin controversy would be prejudiced.” /d. (citing Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984). “And in\ndetermining whether a prospective juror is impliedly biased, ‘his statements upon voir\ndire [about his ability to be impartial] are totally <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” /d. (quoting Haynes, 398\nF.2d at 984).\n\nAs ls relevant here, there are two ways in which courts imply bias. First, “[c]Jourts\nimply bias ‘when there are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and\nthe issues being litigated.”” Daugerdas, 867 F.

Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7 (loth Cir.\nl998) (collecting cases where bias was implied based on the juror’s experiences); see,\ne.g., Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-2o (7th Cir. l992) (holding, in a case\ncharging murder in the course of a burglary, that bias should be implied where two jurors\nwere the victims of similar burglaries during deliberations); Burton v. Johnson, 948 F.2d\nll5o, ll59 (loth Cir. l99l) (holding, in murder case in which the defendant presented a\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9729\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 44 of 66\n2. Inferable bias\n\n““Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a\nrisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to\nexcuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”\nDaugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v. Torres, the defendant was convicted of conspiracy to launder\nthe proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. l28 F.3d\nat 4l. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a\npotential juror who admited that she “had at one time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of\ncash transactions.” Jd. at 42. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that the\n\n37\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9736\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 44 of 49\n\nhis jury service. These requests similarly call for information barred by Rule 6o6(b). And the\noverbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal\ninvestigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the\nGovernment must obtain a search warrant upon a shouing of probable cause. See Stored\nCommunications Act, l8 U.S.C. § 27o3. In response to such warrants, social media platforms\nprovide the entirety of the electronic communications within the account for the relevant\ntimeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to\ndetermine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests\nwere issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 5o’s <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> personal\nsocial media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permited to invade the privacy\nof a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror\n5o opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed\nto establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 5o’s statements about his use of social media,\nso there is no basis to compel the production of such <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> information.\nWI. The Court Should Provide Juror 5o with a Copy of His Questionnaire Before Any\nHearing\n\nOn January lo, 2o22, counsel for Juror 5o filed a motion to intervene and a supporting\nmemorandum of law in the case in order to “protect [Juror 5o’s] privacy rights and his right to\navoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any investigation\nordered by this Court.” (Juror 5o Mem. at 4). Counsel for Juror 5o requested that he be permited\nto intervene, in part, to “assist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry\n\n42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009923.jpg": "Caetesb Ak Ores ABN cme (i FHieeO ORS DP Paki fegye 2a 6767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nPAUL M.

(Opp. at l5-l7). This is nothing more than\nmisdirection and should be rejected.\n\nFor example, the government asserts that Jane’s testimony concerning the New Mexico\nconduct was proper and relevant to the jury’s consideration of the Mann Act counts, and that the\njury “could have convicted even if no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it\nconcluded that the defendant intended for abuse to occur in New York.” (Opp. at ll-l2\n(emphasis in original)). The Court itself raised this same point in declining to give the jury the\nrequested supplemental instruction. (Tr. 3l49-5o). Ms. Maxwell does not dispute either\nassertion. But that is not the issue raised by the Jury Note. In fact, the Jury Note makes clear\nthat the jury was considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four without concluding that she\nintended for Jane to be abused in New York. The question posed in the Jury Note was whether\nMs. Maxwell could “be found guilty” under the second element of Count Four (to use the jury’s\noun words) if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\nin New Mexico. (Court Exhibit #l5). In other words, the jury was asking whether they could\nconvict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on that intent, and that intent alone. The answer to\nthat question is no, and the jury should have been so instructed to prevent a constructive\namendment.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010276.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 647 Filed o3/ll/22 Page lo of 24\n\nThe government further argues that the Jury Note is ambiguous because it is not clear\nwhich flights it refers to or where the jury believed the sexual activity occurred. (Opp. at l5-l6).\nThe first point is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and the second is based on a disingenuous reading of the Jury Note.\nAs to the flights, it is true that one of the jury’s questions was whether it was sufficient to convict\nunder Count Four if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell assisted with Jane’s return trip from New\nMexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. But the problem raised by the Jury Note had nothing\nto do with the specific flights the jury may have been referring to, or whether Jane was on those\nflights, or whether those flights may have gone to New York. The problem raised by the Jury\nNote related to the jury’s other question about Ms. Maxwell’s intent. The jury was asking\nwhether they could convict on Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell’s intent was for Jane\nto engage in sexual activity in New Mexico. That was the question that raised the potential for a\nconstructive amendment. And contrary to the government’s assertion, the Jury Note was crystal\nclear about where the jury believed the sexual activity occurred: New Mexico. See Court Exhibit\n#l5 (“... the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity\n...” (emphasis added)).”\n\nFinally, the government atempts to cast further doubt on the clear meaning of the Jury\nNote by altering its text. The government posits that the jury was asking whether Ms. Maxwell\ncould be found guilty based “in part” on sexual activity occurring in New Mexico. (Opp. at l6).\nThat is simply not what the Jury Note says. The jury could have easily asked that very question:\n“Can Ms. Maxwell be found guilty on Count Four based in part on Jane’s testimony about sexual\nabuse in New Mexico?” In fact, as the government points out, the jury had previously sent a\n2 We note that the government inserted a comma between “New Mexico” and “where/if,” which does not exist in the\nJury Note. Compare Opp. at l3 (“... New Mexico, where/if ...”) with Court Exhibit #l5 (“... New Mexico where/if\n...”). The absence of a comma is significant to the analysis because it clarifies that the jury was focused on New\nMexico as the place where Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to engage in sexual activity.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo276\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page 7 ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

(Motion at 32-33).\n\nThe Court should not credit Juror 5o’s repeated assurances that he would not, and did not,\nlet his past experience of sexual abuse affect his ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the\nevidence. Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of\npotential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or\ninferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts\nand circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial\nevidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admited by the juror himself, ‘partly\nbecause the juror may have an interest in concealing his oun bias and partly because the juror\nmay be unaware of it.’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 558). Here, the record establishes\nthat Juror 5o was biased and would have been struck for cause had he truthfully disclosed his\nhistory of sexual abuse.\n\nB. Juror 5o’s Answers to the Court’s Questions Were Not Credible and Further\n\nRevealed His Bias\n\nJuror 5o’s responses to the Court’s questions at the Hearing were rife with contradictions\nand inconsistencies. His explanation for his false statements on the jury questionnaire—that he\n“flew through” the questions and did not see that multiple questions called for him to disclose his\nsexual abuse—lacked all credibility. And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find\nout about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the international press, including a\nvideo interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was\nuterly implausible.

He testified that his\npersonal history of sexual abuse was not something he typically thought about and that it had not\ncrossed his mind as he filled out the questionnaire.\n\nThe Court asked follou-up questions consistent with those asked of prospective jurors\nduring voir dire who responded affirmatively to Questions 25, 48, and 49 on their questionnaires,\nincluding those questions proposed by Defense counsel at that stage during trial. Further, the\nCourt asked Juror 5o about several potential inconsistencies in his testimony. The Court did not\npermit questions that were inconsistent with the process as it played out in voir dire or otherwise\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> or redundant. Ultimately, Juror 5o testified that his experience would not affect his\nability to be a fair and impartial juror. He affirmed that he did not harbor any bias against the\nDefendant nor in favor of the Government. He asserted that he would be able to assess the\ncredibility of witnesses alleging sexual abuse. And he affirmed that the subject mater of the\ncase would not upset him in such a way that would distract him from his duty as a juror, nor\nwould he be thinking about his experience in a way that would prevent him from being fair or\nimpartial.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental\nbriefing on Juror 5o’s testimony, which the parties simultaneously submited on March l5, 2o22.\nDkt.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n5 It is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality. See Greer, 285 F.3d at l72. Because the Court determines that Juror 5o is neither\nimpliedly nor inferably biased, it need not resolve this issue.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document657_ Filed o4/29/22 Page 33 of 45\nconvictions on Counts Two and Four, erroneously implying that such evidence was <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.\nDkt. No. 566 at 7 (emphasis added). Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758—\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “‘to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2—l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law. Indeed, it was the Defendant’s proposal that\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011135.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page4of7\nwitnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 7o2.\nDef. Br. at l, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 7o2 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks\n“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it\nwill aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.” Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. l:l9-CV-\no9758 (GHW), 2o2l WL 48o3582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2l) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at\n59l). Fit is satisfied if the expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on a relevant\nquestion of fact without “usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to\nthe applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.” /d. (quoting\nUnited States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, lol (2d Cir. l994)). The Court finds that at least some of\nthe Government’s arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution nou. Other aspects\nof the Government’s motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of\ntrial.\n\nThe Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennet Gershman in its entirety. As\nexplained in the notice, Professor Gershman “is a leading authority on prosecutorial\nmisconduct.” Notice at l2. The Defense expects that he will testify “on best practices to ensure\nthe integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nneutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their\ncounsel, and case-related civil litigation.” Jd.\n\nThe Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his\nexpected testimony is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it\nwould “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the\ninvestigation.” Nov. l Tr. at l7. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the\ninvestigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011136.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document69l Filed ll/22/2l Page5of7\ninvestigation are all <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>” to Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. /d. at l9 (quoting United States v.\nDuncan, No. l8-CR-289, 2ol9 WL 22lo663 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9)). The Court concludes that the\nexpected topics of Gershman’s testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact,\nbeing neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims—all fall within the rubric of atacking\nthe thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell’s guilt of the\ncrimes charged. In short, this testimony would run afoul of the instruction that the jury will\nreceive that “the government is not on trial.” /d. at 23 (quoting United States v. Knox, 687 F.\nApp’x 5l, 54 (2d Cir. 2ol7)).\n\nThe Court notes that a court in this district recently excluded Gershman’s testimony in a\ncivil case in which he would have similarly criticized the SEC’s investigation, including the use\nof cooperating witnesses. SEC v. Collector’s Coffee Inc., No. l9-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2o2l\nWL 34l8829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2o2l). That case differs from this one in several respects, but\nthat court’s basic reasoning informs and supports the Court’s decision here.\n\nThe Defense argues that the Court “expressly denied” prohibiting the Defense from\ncalling an expert witness like Gershman.

The Government argues that Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony on psychological diagnoses is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and prejudicial under Rules 4ol and 4o3. The\nSecond Circuit has set out controlling case law to guide the Court’s decision:\n\nEvidence of a witness’s psychological history may be admissible when it goes to\n\nher credibility. In assessing the probative value of such evidence, the court\n\nshould consider such factors as the nature of the psychological problem, the\n\ntemporal recency or remoteness of the history, and whether the witness suffered\n\nfrom the problem at the time of the events to which she is to testify, so that it may\n\nhave affected her ability to perceive or to recall events or to testify accurately.\n\nUnited States v.

First, the report\nis nou over l2 years old. Courts in this circuit regularly find that diagnoses more than lo years\nold lack probative value. E.g., United States v. Bari, 75o F.2d ll69, ll79 (2d Cir. l984)\n(finding that more than lo years is too remote); United States v. Glover, 588 F.2d 876, 878 (2d\nCir. l978) (per curiam) (l2 years too remote); United States v. Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d 255, 264\n(E.D.N.Y. 2oll), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 7o6 F.3d l3l (2d Cir. 2ol3) (l3\nyears too remote); United States v.

Nov. 2o, 2ool) (“A psychological condition from ten years earlier, houever, is likely\nto be <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.”). The diagnoses are therefore too remote to bear on Alleged Victim 4’s\ncredibility as a witness at trial.\n\nSecond, the nature of the conditions and their effect on memory or perception at the time\nof the events in question do not favor admission. Dr. Hall’s report does not delineate clearly\nwhich conditions existed at the time of Epstein’s abuse, but it appears that at least ||\nee\nee But at no point in his report does Dr. Hall suggest that these\nconditions—or any other diagnosed conditions—may have affected Alleged Victim 4’s\nperception of events or her recollection of those events.

The Court will also preclude the opinion. In this circumstance, the lasting mental\nimpact of a crime is at best “minimally probative” of whether that crime was commited. United\nStates v. Hendricks, 92l F.3d 32o, 329 (2d Cir. 2ol9). It also carries a high risk of Rule 4o3\nprejudice by suggesting that the psychological impact on Alleged Victim 4 is relevant to Ms.\nMaxwell’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It would also cause substantial delay by opening the\ndoor to rebutal evidence by the Government on Alleged Victim 4’s mental health, which would\nlikely lead to mini-trials on <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> issues.\n\nNext, the disclosure states that Dr. Hall will testify to the “significance” of Alleged\nVictim 4’s diagnoses. Notice at l2. First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current disclosure\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d.

Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\n“exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.”\n\nAs a general mater, “extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a\nwitness’s conduct in order to atack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness.” Fed. R.\nEvid. 6o8(b). The Rules permit extrinsic evidence for “other grounds of impeachment (such as\ncontradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and mental capacity).” United States v.

But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered for impeachment on a collateral issue is\nproperly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, l44 F.3d 24l, 245-46 (2d Cir. l998); see United Sates\nv.

(Tr. 349).\n\nJane’s sexual activity when she was an adult is entirely collateral to this case. Consistent\nwith Rule 4l2, the parties could not have offered independent evidence about who else participated\nin Jane’s sexual activity over the age of consent. See Dore, 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6 (defining\n“maters which are not collateral” as “those maters which are relevant to the issues in the case and\ncould be independently proven.”). Accordingly, as the Government explained as part of the\nlitigation over Rule 4l2, the Government offered only brief testimony on direct about Jane’s\nrelationships after the age of consent in order to conclude the narrative. (See ll/lo/2l Tr. at l6o).\nSpecifically, the Government asked about five questions establishing that, after Jane moved to\nNew York and turned l8, she spent time with the defendant and Epstein and continued engaging\nin sexualized massages. (Tr. 349-5o).\n\nThe defendant proposes to do something quite different. The anticipated testimony is, at\nleast in part, an atempt to substantively impeach Jane on the identities of individuals with whom\nshe had adult sexual contact. ee\nee\nee Both are not relevant or subjects of independent proof in\nthis case—they are collateral.\n\nThird, even if the anticipated testimony did impeach Jane, and even if the testimony were\nabout a non-collateral mater, it is impeachment by contradiction of a fact elicited on cross-\nexamination. This is precisely the sort of impeachment that the rules are intended to prohibit.\nAbsent Jane’s testimony on cross, it would be <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> and improper for the defendant to call\nwitnesses to say that they did not have sexual activity with Jane and the defendant.

If a commercial sex act occurred involving a l7-year-old in New York, that sexual\nactivity is illegal under l8 U.S.C. § l59l because it involves a minor, even though it is above New\nYork’s age of consent. Although the instruction uses the phrase “illegal sexual activity,” an\nelement of the Mann Act, the jury is likely not to grasp that point in a short mid-trial instruction,\ndivorced from a discussion of the elements of the offenses. The jury would therefore also be\nconfused into thinking incorrectly that sexual activity that is “not illegal” under the local law is\nsimilarly lawful under federal law.\n\nFinally, the Government notes that—as to New Mexico in particular—age of consent is\nnot a simple and straightforward question. As the defense noted in their opposition to the\nGovernment’s motions in limine, “New Mexico does not have a specific age of consent.” (Def.\nOpp. at 46, Dkt. No. 483). The age of consent can also depend on the specific sexual act involved,\nwhich may require analysis of New Mexico state law in comparison to the facts elicited at trial.\nCompare id. at 46 & n.43 (noting that the age of consent depends on whether coercion or force are\ninvolved), with State v. Begaye, -- P. 3d --, 2o2l WL 5l73l5o, at * 2 (N.M. Ct. App. 2o2l)\n(affirming conviction of defendant who forcibly hugged a sixteen-year-old and, when releasing\nher, “brushed his hand over her chest and squeezed her breast”). It therefore cannot be said that a\nsexual act in New Mexico was “above the age of consent” without determining what sexual act\noccurred and hou New Mexico state law would treat that act.\n\nIn the Government’s view, these issues are best explained to the jury in the concluding jury\ninstructions, where the jury can be fully instructed on the relevant law and then apply that law to\nthe facts it finds have been established at trial. And no limiting instruction is needed because, as\nwill be explained to the jury in the concluding instructions, they can only convict for violations of\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011309.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page6eof7\nthe Mann Act with the New York state law (including the New York age of consent) as its object,\nor for violations of § l59l, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. There is accordingly no risk\nthat the jury will convict the defendant for violating an unidentified local sex crimes law for which\nthe Minor Victim was above the age of consent. Asa result, the Government respectfully requests\nthat the Court refrain from giving the second limiting instruction at all during this trial.\n\nIf the Court nevertheless decides to give the second limiting instruction, the Government\nproposes the follouing revision to give the jury an understanding both of what is and what is not\nillegal sexual activity:\n\nI anticipate that you will hear testimony from the next witness about sexual conduct\n\nthat she says she had with Mr. Epstein in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New\n\nMexico]. I instruct you that if and when beeause the witness was over the age of\n\nconsent in [insert relevant jurisdiction, e.g. New Mexico] at the relevant time\n\nperiod, the sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not itself “illegal\n\nsexual activity” as the Government has charged in the Indictment. [The age of\n\nconsent in that jurisdiction is [insert relevant age of consent or analysis\n\nthereof]]._ Houever, to the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to\n\nthe issues before you, including the defendant’s intent for that witness to engage\n\nin illegal sexual activity in New York as charged in the Indictment, you may\n\nconsider it. Even when the witness was over the age of consent in [insert\n\nrelevant jurisdiction, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may\nconclude that the witness was belou the age of consent in New York, which is\n\nl7 years old. [For witnesses relevant to the sex trafficking counts: Further,\n\nthe sexual conduct may be considered in determining whether the defendant\n\nintended the witness to engage in a “commercial sex act” before reaching the\n\nage of l8, and for which the age of consent in [insert relevant jurisdiction] is\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.] Houever, you may not consider this testimony regarding sexual\n\nactivity that took place above the age of consent with respect to the relevant\nstatute as I have just described it as any kind of reflection on Mr. Epstein’s nor\n\nMs. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in the\n\nIndictment.\n\nThe proposed revision provides the jury with information that matches the expected\ntestimony, provides the jury with sufficient context about the question before it to avoid confusion\nabout hou it can and cannot consider the sexual activity, avoids an inaccurate statement of state\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011336.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l9 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

There is no connection between “subject mater of\nthe prior [allegedly] deceptive act and that of the instant litigation.” See id.\n\nCases permiting cross-examination about an atorney’s disbarment or suspension are not\nto the contrary. E.g., United States v.

Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do\nthat, and the government cites no authority for its argument.\n\nWhat’s more telling is that the government never shoued Jane their photographs. The\ngovernment’s deliberate choice to muddy the waters is not Ms. Maxwell’s fault or her problem.\nThe record shous Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino are the “Eva,” “Michelle,” and\n“Kelly” who Jane testified about.

For one thing, Jane also did not use last names in her interviews with the FBI. For another\nthing, Eva Dubin’s name was already on the record from Mr. Visoski’s testimony, and Jane\nadmited knouing Kelly’s last name. Finally, Ms. Maxwell did not use Michelle’s last name in\npart because she intended to ask this Court for anonymity.

Ms. Maxwell claims\nthe statement in Ms. Moe’s email is relevant for only two reasons: (l) “Jane’s motive to\ncooperate and testify,” and (2) “her memory and capacity as a witness since she cannot recall a\nhighly consequential conversation she just had months ago.” (Maxwell Motion at l-2). Both\nalleged reasons are based on a faulty premise and are factually untrue.\n\nThe August l7, 2o2l email from Ms. Moe expressly states that the alleged statement at\nissue occurred before Ms. Maxwell was criminally charged — not “just ... months ago” in August\n2o2l -- as Ms. Maxwell appears to insinuate. Ms. Maxwell was arrested and charged on July 2,\n2o2o — more than a year before the email from Ms. Moe was writen.\n\nJane's civil case setled on December ll, 2o2o—8 months before Ms. Moe’s email was\nwriten and approximately a year before she testified at this trial. Accordingly, once Jane made\nthe decision to setle her civil case in December of 2o2o, there was no case to “help” in August\nof 2o2l when the email was writen or a year later when she testified at this trial.\n\nFurther, Ms. Maxwell contends that because Jane testified on cross-examination that she\ndid not knou that cooperating with the government would help her civil case, Mr. Glassman’s\npurported statement to Ms. Moe in August of 2o2l would somehou be relevant in shedding light\non that issue.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package. Houever,\nat the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing in this case, this Court rejected the defendant’s request to keep\nthe record open to allou the defendant to do precisely what she has done here—namely, present\nmore detailed information about her finances and a more concrete package—determining that\nfurther information about her financial picture would be <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because no combination of\nconditions could ensure this defendant’s appearance. The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo64\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020110.jpg": "CaSede2otepQd36ouAdnnt Bo cutrent! lo22 lFiled32728/2o9 dgef 7l Gb l5\n\nhere. Whether or not the accusers’ recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to\nthe strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThe only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal\nvalue. The government references rrr\n| | (/d. at ll). But even the government concedes that, at best,\nCiS\n\nIt is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” the accusers or\nknouingly facilitated or participated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors will come solely from\nthe testimony of the three accusers. The government’s case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests\nentirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses. Moreover, the substantive\ncounts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-l.\nIt is also telling that the government does not even atempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it\ndid not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death\nof Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact\n' The government also proffers that they will have “additional witnesses.” (Gov. Mem. at ll). But these are not\n“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.\nInstead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims\nwhen those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”\nsomeone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.\n* One of the witnesses has submited a leter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the leter\nshould be given no legal weight in the Court’s bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 3l9, 33l-\n32 (E.D.N.Y. 2oo5)\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ollo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020302.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 76, o4/l9/2o2l, 3o8o288, Pagel2 of 3o\nGov tEx. (April 6, 2o2l leter, n.2). But as Ms. Maxwell explained, the\nGovernment’s narrative is total fiction — the unsanitary conditions are\ncaused by other inmates and guards, not Ms. Maxwell.\n\n9. The Government also makes much of Ms. Maxwell’s\nvaccination. Again this demonstrates a gross double standard. Imagine\nif the defense had publicly filed medical information about the accusers.\nThere would be hell to pay. The Government insists on secrecy and\nredactions when discussing their witnesses, and will not even reveal their\nnames. Yet it freely discloses private information in violation of HIPAA\nabout Ms. Maxwell in public filings.\n\nIn any event, whether Ms. Maxwell is vaccinated or not does not\nhelp her search documents on an ancient computer or give her access to\na printer or allou her to meet with her lawyers (who would still need to\ncome into the jail and interact with numerous other prisoners and guards\nwho have not been vaccinated).

STERNHEIA\\\ninvestigation in 2oo7 (see Dkt. l99 at l-2), long before commencing this prosecution against Ms.\nMaxwell. We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\n<span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020310.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tran S3osaTentDGcWArW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, 57Age Rage 3 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of technical issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

United States v. Napolitano, 552\nF. Supp. 465, 48o (S.D.N.Y. l982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim\ntraveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the\nCourt cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the\ncharged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United\nStates v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. l992). The Court will follou the well-worn\npath of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion\nthen.\n\nVII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature\n\nMaxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the Sl superseding\nindictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has\nalleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it\ncharges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,\nonly one crime has been commited.” United States v. Chacko, l69 F.3d l4o, l45 (2d Cir. l999).\n“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,\nwhich assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple\npunishments for the same offense.” United States v.

Because\nthese arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.°\n\n“Implied bias” is “‘a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a\nconclusive presumption of bias as a mater of law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48 (internal quotations\nomited) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at l72). Such bias is “atributed to a prospective juror\nregardless of actual partiality” because the law presumes that “‘an average person in the position\nof the juror in controversy would be prejudiced.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.\nWood, 299 U.S. l23, l33 (l936)); see also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applies to\n“certain highly limited situations where a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of\npartiality that the law requires the judge to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 4l.\nNamely, “jurors who are related to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the\nalleged crime itself are impliedly biased. /d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d at l72.\n\nOn the other hand, a finding of inferred bias is a determination within the trial court’s\ndiscretion. Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l; see also McCoy, 995 F.3d at 49. “Bias may be inferred when\na juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant\ngranting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make\nmandatory a presumption of bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at l7l (quoting Torres, l28 F.3d at 47)).\nThe inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference that the juror in\nquestion would not be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. If such\nfacts are elicited, “then, just as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or\nher ability to be impartial become <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span>.” /d. Houever, “a judge may—particularly when\n> Tt is unsetled in the Second Circuit whether implied or inferred bias may serve as the basis for a post-trial\nallegation of juror partiality.

Thus, in light of the note’s ambiguity and the Defendant’s\nfailure to propose an accurate response in either the first atempt or the second atempt a day\nlater, the Court’s decision to refer the jury back to the legally sound charge was not error and\nplainly did not result in a constructive amendment to the Indictment.\n\nThe Defendant does not expressly contend that the instructions were legally erroneous—\nnor could she. As explained above, the charge made clear that the only predicate state law at\nissue was New York’s. Instead, the Defendant objects that the charge was “stripped of any\nmention of ‘travel to New York.’” Maxwell Br. at l5. But the Court rejected the Defendant’s\nspecific requests that were unnecessary, inaccurate, or would have confused the jury. For\nexample, the Court rejected the Defendant’s request to limit the charge to requiring travel from\n“Florida to New York,” as alleged in the “to wit” clause of the Indictment, because travel from\nNew Mexico to New York, for example, would also have been sufficient. See Trial Tr. at 2758-\n6l (Charging Conference); see also United States v. Litle, 828 F. App’x 34, 37-38 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (summary order) (noting that generally, “to wit’ clauses do not modify essential elements\nof the offense”). The Court also denied the Defendant’s request to instruct the jury on law\ngoverning the age of consent in New Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Florida. First, the\nDefendant’s proposal oversimplified New Mexico’s age of consent law. The Court could not\naccurately instruct the jury on New Mexico’s law without potentially introducing a theory of\nguilt that the Government had not charged, or resolving a factual question on the use of force for\nthe jury. Trial Tr. at l7l2-l3; Nov. 23, 2o2l, Final Pretrial Conference Tr. at 3l-38. And\nsecond, instructing on state law that the Defendant was not alleged to have violated ran a serious\nrisk of confusing the jury as to the role of that law.

Instead, Thomas seeks\nevidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies,\nsupervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he\ncan engage in atempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions “led” to the criminal\nconduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him.

Thomas is not\nentitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—\nthat would aid in that nullification effort because Rule l6 only entitles a defendant to discovery\nfor purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government’s case in chief, not the merits of the\ndecision to prosecute.\n\nl.

Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a\ncriminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly\ninnocent motive in a false statement case is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to the question of intent. See United States\nv. Washington, 7o5 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C.

Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. l992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context\nargument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).\n\nFor the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or\nconspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is <span class=\"highlight\">irrelevant</span> to each of the\nforegoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees\nfalsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of\nwhat other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas\nbelieved falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the\ncharges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 76o F.2d l366, l372 (2d Cir. l985)\n(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United\nStates v.

There is no basis to compel production of evidence\nrelated to those maters under Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because\nthe evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent atempt at nullification.
