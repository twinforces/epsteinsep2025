Indeed, “[i]t is well setled that the essential elements of\nthe crime of conspiracy are: (l) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit\nan offense; (2) the defendant knouingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to\ncommit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of\nthe conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was commited by one or\nmore of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United\nStates v. Salameh, l52 F.3d 88, l45-46 (2d Cir. l998).\n\nBecause a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not\nmater whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements\nof the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522\nU.S. at 65. What maters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to\nparticipate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act\nwould be commited, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of\nthat conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in\nrecruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the\nperiod charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to\nidentify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the\n>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,\nshe asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they\noccurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, houever, because Minor Victim-\n3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>,\nexploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the\njury that any consensual act commited after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent\nwas itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense\ncounsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular\nline of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the\nappropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.\n\nl62\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l23", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003126.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l92 of 239\nthe Court informing the jury that, to convict on any conspiracy count, it must find at least one overt\nact in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute of limitations. See Benussi,\n2l6 F. Supp. 2d at 3o9 (describing a similar jury instruction provided for a conspiracy containing\nsome allegations that were time-barred and others that were timely).\n\nSecond, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are no more\ninflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-l and Minor\nVictim-2. The references to “sexual abuse” accurately describe Minor Victim-3’s experience of\nsex acts with Epstein as <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>, exploitative, and abusive, and she will testify to that effect at\ntrial. Moreover, because these acts were commited in furtherance of the criminal conspiracies\ncharged in the Indictment, it is neither misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity\ninvolved illegal conduct. More to the point, because evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 “‘is\nadmissible and relevant to the charge[s]” contained in Counts One and Three of the Indictment,\nthe language describing Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment “may not be stricken”\n“regardless of hou prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpa, 9l3 F.2d at lol3 (quoting DePalma,\n46l F. Supp. at 797).\n\nFinally, even if Minor Victim-3’s experiences did not constitute direct evidence of the\ncrimes charged—which they do—this same evidence will also be admissible pursuant to Rule\n4o4(b) to prove the defendant’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. Federal Rule of Evidence\n4o4(b) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nEvidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove\na person’s character in order to shou that on a particular occasion\nthe person acted in accordance with the character.

The obvious flaws in this logic are at least\nthreefold. First, the Indictment does not merely imply that the alleged conduct involving\nAccuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexuall[]\nabuse[].” Second, as the government points out repeatedly, an overt act in furtherance of a\nconspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e.g., Opp. l6l (“It is axiomatic that a conspiracy\ndoes not require a completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is\ncircular: It argues simultaneously that Accuser-3’s lawful sexual encounters with Epstein\ndemonstrate the existence of a conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy makes those\nsexual encounters unlawful.\n\nSince the government concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with Accuser-3 was\nconsensual and lawful, and that Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s\nallegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts to a\nknouingly false accusation that she commited a crime. It is hard to conceive of a more\ninflammatory or prejudicial allegation.\n\nAlso troubling is the government’s statement that Accuser-3 will testify to her “subjective\nexperience” of her admitedly lawful sexual encounters with Epstein “as <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>, exploitative,\nand abusive.” See Opp. l62 n.57 (emphasis added). To the extent that evidence regarding\nAccuser-3’s involvement in lawful sexual activity in England while she was above the age of\nlegal consent has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause underage girls to\ntravel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that relevance certainly does not\nencompass Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of her lawful, consensual encounters.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of Rocchio’s proposed testimony.\nThat rule says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nRule 7o2 charges district courts “with ‘the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony\nboth rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.’” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R_R.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597); see Fed.\nR. Evid. 4ol & 4o2. A court must ensure that an expert “employs in the courtroom the same\nlevel of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Nimely\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5632", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005642.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 24\n\nFinally, Rocchio’s second opinion is inadmissible under Rules 7o4 and 4o3. It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of exclusion\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol, 2l5\n(2d Cir. 2oo5) (“[T]he jury’s singular responsibility to decide from the evidence admited at trial\nwhether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”). That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse. Rocchio’s opinions on\nthose consequences are irrelevant under Rule 4ol and 4o2, they will not assist the trier of fact in\ndeciding the case, Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5642", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5644", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005646.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005650.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page2of4\noa U.S. Department of Justice\nee” United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Disclosure by the Government\n\nDr. Lisa Rocchio is the President-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology of the\nAmerican Psychological Association (“APA”). Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since\nearning her Ph.D. in l995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School\nof Broun University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since\nshe entered private practice in l998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. In the last twenty-three years, Dr. Rocchio\nhas treated hundreds of victims of trauma, many of whom were minor victims of sexual abuse.\nDr. Rocchio has also received specialized training in <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress, sexual abuse, and clinical\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo565o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005651.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page3of4\nPage 2\nand forensic psychology. She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice\n\nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal\nnotice under Rule l6(b)(l)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert\nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a writen summary of any testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 7o2, 7o3, or 7o5 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as\nwell as the witness’s qualifications.\n\n' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal\nand state litigation.

The\ngovernment also represented for the first time that Accuser-3 is expected to testify that\nId. Accordingly, Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was a minor when she traveled or when she\nallegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in the United States.\n\nDespite having been alerted to the problems with Accuser-3’s evidence, the government\nrepeated the same allegations related to Accuser-3 in the second superseding indictment filed\nafter the pretrial motions were fully briefed. See S2 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. l87) (“S2\nIndictment”) §f[ 9(c), l3(d), l9(d).

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “‘sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice”)).

CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5789", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005800.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58oo", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005807.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 24 of 84\n\nThe defense argues that this opinion is outside Dr. Rocchio’s expertise because she has “‘no\nexperience treating alleged perpetrators,” so “her view . . . is entirely one-sided.” (/d.). As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the literature and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l3). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an\nopinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on\nthe features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their\nresponsibilities. To the contrary, the defense concerns underscore hou relevant this opinion will\nbe in aiding the jurors in understanding the testimony at trial.\n\n3. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Long-Term Consequences of Abuse is Admissible\n\nDr. Rocchio will also testify that “[r]epeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at\n2). As Dr. Rocchio will explain, and as is detailed in her Jencks Act material®, experiencing child\n® The Government produced Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material to the defense at the time of the\nexpert notice. (See Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (“The Government is producing notes from the\nGovernment’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.”)).\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005808.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse.

See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 84\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed disclosure helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed disclosure are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005913.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Instead, right after claiming that “[c]linical\npsychologists are not so credulous,” the government essentially says to Ms. Maxwell, “Hou dare\nyou?” In the government’s words, “The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim\nthat Dr. Rocchio has been misled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events that did not occur.” Resp. at l6.\n\nIn this way, and in one breath, the government atests that Rocchio is “not so credulous.”\nBut in the next breath, the government asks this Court to assume that Rocchio “has [not] been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events that did\nnot occur.” In other words, the government asks this Court to assume Rocchio’s patients are\ntelling the truth, just as Rocchio does.

The government does\nnot, houever, contend that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” anyone for her oun benefit; instead, the\ngovernment contends that she “groomed” them for Epstein’s benefit.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l9o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page ll of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Pagellofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage lo\n\nDissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,\nand experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6263", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006264.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Houever, much can ride on the\nheuristics individuals use to resolve this indeterminate mater.\n\nA False Memory\n\nThe theory of repression, according to Freud (l9lo), posits that <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>\nmemories can be pushed out of conscious awareness and essentially forgot-\nten for long periods of time. Though some psychologists argue there is a\nlack of empirical support for the theory of repression (Loftus, l993), many\npsychologists do believe that repression is a real process by which memo-\nries can be forgoten and later remembered (Boag, 2olo). One psychological\nprocess that may resemble repression is false memory.\n\nThe existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of\ncontroversy (McNally & Geraerts, 2oo9), and yet research does exist demon-\nstrating the successful implantation of fabricated memories. In one of the first\nstudies on the implantation of false memories, participants were given short\nnarratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives,\nand asked to try to remember these experiences (Loftus, Coan, & Pickrell,\nl996). Participants’ relatives were contacted and asked to provide childhood\nstories about the participants. Houever, researchers created one fabricated\nnarrative: The participant, at age 5 or 6, had been lost in a public place (e.g.\na shopping mall) for an extended period of time and eventually rescued.\nParticipants were encouraged to try to remember both true and fabricated\nevents over the course of several weeks. When participants were asked later\nwhether they recalled the events, nearly one-fourth of them reported having\nmemories of the fabricated event. Though some individuals reported remem-\nbering being lost only vaguely, others reported remembering vivid visual\ndetails and emotional experiences. Since this study, several researchers have\nsuccessfully replicated these results using different suggestive techniques\nand scenarios (e.g. Mazzoni, Loftus, Seitz, & Lynn, l999; Hyman & Billings,\nl998; Hyman & Pentland, l996; Garry, Manning, Loftus, & Sherman, l998).\nMany of the suggestive methods used in these experiments are similar to\nthose employed by some therapists during psychotherapy (Ofshe & Waters,\nl994, Pesant & Zadra, 2oo4).\n\nIt has been argued that suggestive therapeutic techniques could cause a\nclient to create a false <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory (Loftus, l993). An example of this\ntype of suggestion would be for a therapist to conclude that the client shous\nsigns of abuse despite no memory of abuse, and thus the client should try\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6279", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006280.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l2 of 29\nlo6 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nharder to remember whether any abuse may have occurred (as cited in\nLoftus, 2oo3).\n\nIndeed, there have been several legal cases in which therapy clients or\ntheir relatives successfully sued or received setlements from their therapists\nfor using therapy techniques that may have induced patients into creating\nfalse memories of past abuse (Loftus, l997). In one such case in l986,\nNadeen Cool sued her therapist who used hypnosis and other suggestive\ntherapeutic techniques to uncover “lost memories” of abuse (Loftus, l997).\nThrough therapy, Cool remembered being in a satanic cult, eating babies,\nand being raped, among other horrific events. She came to believe she had\nmore than l2o different personalities and even underwent an exorcism led\nby her therapist who sprinkled holy water and demanded Satan to leave her\nbody. Later, Cool realized that her memories were not real and were planted\nby her therapist. The therapist setled out of court for $2.4 million.\n\nThough the false memories discussed thus far have all been entirely fab-\nricated, some false memories are created surrounding real events. Memories\nof an event can be tampered by exposure to subtle misinformation after the\nevent has occurred (Loftus & Palmer, l974; Loftus, l975; Loftus, Miller, &\nBurns, l978). In one famous study by Loftus and Palmer (l974), researchers\nshoued participants short clips of traffic accidents and were asked to rate\nthe speed at which the accident happened. Houever, when questioning the\nparticipants, researchers cleverly manipulated the use of verbs. For instance,\nsome participants were asked the speed at which vehicles smashed into each\nother. Other participants were asked to report the speed at which vehicles\nbit, collided with, bumped, or contacted each other. Participants respond-\ning to the word smashed not only reported a higher speed at which the cars\nwere travelling but weeks later were more likely to recall having seen broken\nglass at the scene. These findings in addition to Loftus’s later work on the\nnature of leading questions (Loftus, l975; Loftus et al., l978) revealed hou\nsubtle information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that\nevent. Loftus and her students have since conducted more than 2oo stud-\nies with more than 2o,ooo participants demonstrating hou misinformation\nintroduced after an event can induce people into creating false memories\n(Loftus, l997).\n\nRepressed memories have not been disproved. Houever, scientific stud-\nies have demonstrated that significant errors in memory and the creation\nof false memories of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events are possible. When the claimant\nsuddenly recovers a memory of a past sexual assault, investigation of the\nevents surrounding the recovery of the memory, including suggestive ther-\napy and investigative techniques (e.g. events surrounding police lineups and\nquestioning), must be examined and may shed light on the validity of the\nrecovered memory.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo628o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006287.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations ll3\npsychotic disorder, psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition,\nsubstance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified. Each of these disorders is knoun to cause gross impairment in\nfunctioning.\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) details com-\nmon delusions that may be pervasive in individuals with delusional disorder.\nOther psychotic disorders may be associated with these delusional themes as\nwell. Erotomatic delusions involve irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that some person is in love with the delusional individual. The\nindividual may claim that a movie star or superior at work is secretly\nin love with him or her and that there is a spiritual tie between them.\nAnother delusional theme of interest is the persecutory type. This delu-\nsional theme is characterized by irrational, unsubstantiated, or impossible\nclaims that the individual has been wronged and that some injustice has\ntaken place. Frequent appeals to the court system are common in which the\nindividual atempts to persecute the central person in the delusion. Mixed\ntypes of delusions involve delusions in which no one type predominates.\nA mixed erotomatic and persecutory type might be the type of delusion that\nwould lead to a false allegation of sexual assault. Houever, delusions can\nbe complex and difficult to categorize, even when they are sexual in nature.\n\nStudies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions that\nare sexual in nature are not uncommon and are occur more often in women\nthan in men (Galdos & van Os, l995; Meloy, l989). Some cases of sexual\ndelusions have been documented. In one case, Rosenthal and McGuinness\n(l986), two psychiatric nurses, wrote about a client with delusions cen-\ntered on sex. “When her hydrotherapist offered her a backrub one day,\nshe exclaimed, ‘Don’t touch me! I am not your homosexual lover’’(p. l49).\nThese delusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual relations\nor events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.\nDissociation\nDissociation is “the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feel-\nings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory”\n(Berstein & Putnam, l986). According to the DSM-IV-TR (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2ooo), dissociation involves a disruption or spliting\noff of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient.\nCurrently, there is some controversy concerning the function, antecedents\nand etiology of dissociation (Candel, Merckelbach, & Kuijpers, 2oo3).\n\nDissociative tendencies have been thought to exist as a stable trait\nin some individuals (Waller, Putnam, & Carlson, l996), though most\nresearch has looked only at dissociation in relation to <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> expe-\nriences. Much of the focus on the relationship between trauma and\ndissociation may be the result of earlier studies that found a relationship\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6287", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 2o of 29\n\nll4 J. Engle and W. O’Donohbue\n\nbetween reports of childhood trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.\nSanders & Giolas, l99l). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-\nmatic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (postraumatic\ndissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,\ndetachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness\nduring the <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,\nl996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the\nrelationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and postraumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate\npredictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2oo9).\n\nSome psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-\nanism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, l999).\nHouever, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-\nmatic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma\nsurvivors (Tichenor et al., l996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation\nhas been shoun in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation\n(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2oo5; van der Kolk & Fisler, l995) and to two\nprominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &\nGeisbrecht, 2oo5) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &\nHorselenberg, 2ooo).\n\nIn one study (Candel et al., 2oo3), lou and high dissociators were read\nstories of a <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after\ncontrolling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of\ncommission—that is, added false content—than lou dissociators, though\nthe two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study\nby Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,\n2oo2), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of\nthe story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to\ntest suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-\ntors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than\nlou dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also\nmore likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have\nfantasy proneness. Similar studies have shoun a small trend touard a rela-\ntionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,\nGeraerts, & Merckelbach, 2oo7). The results of these studies indicate that\ndissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and\nthat absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-\nmatic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies\nsuggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-\nory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of\ndissociation.\n\nA review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,\nLynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2oo8) cited evidence that trait dissociation\nis likely to be associated with memory distortions.

Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6593", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006594.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8of24\n\nGovernment does not presently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding\n\nany specific victim.\nId. at 2.\n\nThe government elaborates that Rocchio will offer this testimony based\n\non her education and training on psychological trauma, <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress,\n\ninterpersonal violence, and sexual abuse [and her] extensive clinical experience\n\ntreating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in childhood and\n\nadolescence, as well as [her] experience conducting forensic psychological\n\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.\nId. at 2.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 7o2 governs the admissibility of Rocchio’s proposed testimony.\nThat rule says:\n\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knouledge, skill, experience, training,\n\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n\n(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knouledge will help the\n\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\n\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\n\ncase.\nFed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nRule 7o2 charges district courts “with ‘the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony\nboth rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.’” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R_R.\nPassenger Corp., 3o3 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 2oo2) (quoting Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 597); see Fed.\nR. Evid. 4ol & 4o2. A court must ensure that an expert “employs in the courtroom the same\nlevel of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Nimely\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6594", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel8 of 24\n\nFinally, Rocchio’s second opinion is inadmissible under Rules 7o4 and 4o3. It’s\ninadmissible under Rule 7o4 because it amounts to an opinion that the alleged victims in this\ncase are testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, houever, is a question for the jury\nto decide. It is not properly the subject of an expert opinion.\n\nRocchio’s proposed testimony also violates Rule 4o3, because it risks jurors accepting\nher “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence and to come\nto their oun independent judgment. And because expert opinion testimony can be both\n“pouerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 595, the balance weighs in favor of exclusion\nwhen the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not helpful to the jury.\n\nC. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of\n\nvictimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and\npsychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of\ncomplex trauma.\n\nRocchio’s third opinion—that repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood\nof victimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma—has nothing to do\nwith this case. It is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nThis case is about one thing: Whether the government can prove each of the elements of\nthe indicted offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Garcia, 4l3 F.3d 2ol, 2l5\n(2d Cir. 2oo5) (“[T]he jury’s singular responsibility to decide from the evidence admited at trial\nwhether the government has carried its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”). That is the\nonly thing the jury will be asked to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the\n“long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological consequences” of alleged abuse. Rocchio’s opinions on\nthose consequences are irrelevant under Rule 4ol and 4o2, they will not assist the trier of fact in\ndeciding the case, Fed. R. Evid. 7o2.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and disclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late\ndisclosure—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o6", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006608.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 24\nwitness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility\ndeterminations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 7o2.”)\n(citations omited). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure\nof <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page2of4\noa U.S. Department of Justice\nee” United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since\nearning her Ph.D. in l995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School\nof Broun University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since\nshe entered private practice in l998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse.

Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.

R.\nEvid. 4o3. According to the government, Accuser-3 is expected to testify that she was “sexually\nabused” by Epstein, not because she was underage and incapable of consent by law, but because\nher “‘subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>, exploitative, and\nabusive.” Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l62 n.57. If Accuser-3 is\nalloued to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury will naturally\nassume that the alleged sex acts were illegal, when they were not. Indeed, even if she is not\nalloued to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the mere fact that Accuser-3 will be testifying about\nalleged sex acts that she participated in with a much older man when she was l7 years old will\nlikely lead the jury to assume that the conduct was illegal, especially after they have heard the\nexpected testimony of the other accusers in this case.\n\nHence, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence\nand will misapply it in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies, both of which require that Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that the accusers\nwould engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. This risk substantially outweighs the limited\nprobative effect of Accuser-3’s evidence. Even if the Court were to give the jury an appropriate\nlimiting instruction, there is a substantial risk that it would not be sufficient to ensure that the\njury did not misinterpret or misapply this evidence. See Curley, 639 F.3d at 6o (quoting United\nStates v. Figueroa, 6l8 F.2d 934, 946 (2d Cir. l98o) (“limiting instructions cannot be regarded\nas a guaranty against prejudice’”’)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6643", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6of84\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological consequences, especially when it\noccurs in the context of complex trauma.

Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 84\npatients are telling the truth.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally\nundermines the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no knoun or identified rate\nof error. . . nor is there a reliable method or a series of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to\nwhether an individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d. (alterations and quotation marks\nomited)). Clinical psychologists are not so credulous. As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a\npracticing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided\nby patients and assesses patient self-reporting in the context of literature and knouledge that she\nhas developed in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes clear, Dr.\nRocchio has treated hundreds and hundreds of patients in her decades of experience, and her\nopinions are based in part on the significant paterns she has observed among the patients she has\ntreated. The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. Rocchio has been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events that did not\noccur.\n\nIn any event, the defendant’s argument about error rates misunderstands the nature of a\nDaubert inquiry. An error rate is but one of the Daubert factors that may or may not be applicable\nin every case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at 33o. And in cases such as this, where a social science\nexpert is testifying based on qualitative methodology, that factor is inapplicable. See Torres, 2o2l\nWL l9475o3, at *6n.8. As the Second Circuit has explained, “Peer review, publication, potential\nerror rate, etc... . are not applicable to this kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily\non the knouledge and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it. In\nsuch cases, the place to quibble with [an expert’s] academic training is on cross-examination . . .\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006732.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 24 of 84\n\nThe defense argues that this opinion is outside Dr. Rocchio’s expertise because she has “‘no\nexperience treating alleged perpetrators,” so “her view . . . is entirely one-sided.” (/d.). As is clear\nfrom the above excerpt, her testimony is about largely about trust and atachment built in victims,\nand the resultant ways in which victims process abuse. But she is also an expert in the actions and\ntechniques of perpetrators through her review of the literature and the lens of what she has learned\nthrough victims. This opinion is therefore squarely within Dr. Rocchio’s expertise.\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that this testimony violates Rule 7o4, because it is an “opinion\nthat the alleged victims in this case are testifying truthfully,” and 4o3, because it “risks jurors\naccepting her ‘expert’ opinion as gospel at the expense of their duty to evaluate the evidence.”\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l3). Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated the victims in this case and will not express an\nopinion as to whether they are testifying truthfully. And the defense motion is entirely unclear on\nthe features of this expert opinion that create risk that the jurors would abdicate their\nresponsibilities. To the contrary, the defense concerns underscore hou relevant this opinion will\nbe in aiding the jurors in understanding the testimony at trial.\n\n3. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Long-Term Consequences of Abuse is Admissible\n\nDr. Rocchio will also testify that “[r]epeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at\n2).

(See Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (“The Government is producing notes from the\nGovernment’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.”)).\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6732", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006733.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 25 of 84\nsexual abuse can lead to a variety of psychological difficulties, including substance use and\nparticipation in risky sexual behavior. Complex trauma—trauma involving repetitive or prolonged\nexposure to or experiences of multiple <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stressors, involving harm or abandonment by\ntrusted adults, and occurring at developmentally vulnerable times—can lead to various\npsychological consequences, including dysregulation in emotional control, difficulties in\nrelationships or with behavioral control, and distorted perceptions of the self and others.\n\nThis opinion is highly relevant. It is likely that jurors will not be intimately familiar with\nthe consequences of child sexual abuse. Accordingly, the causal connection between these\npsychological problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror. Yet\nthat information will aid the jury in two respects: First, it will help jurors assess the credibility of\nMinor Victims, to the extent they have had some of these psychological symptoms or had other\ndifficulties described by Dr. Rocchio in the years since their abuse. For instance, the Government\nexpects the defense to atack the credibility of a Minor Victim by crossO-examining her about her\nsubstance abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will provide the jury with a fuller picture by shouing\nthat substance abuse can be a consequence of sexual trauma. Second, experiencing certain\npsychological difficulties is consistent with past child sexual abuse and complex trauma. It is\nevidence that Minor Victims in fact experienced child sexual abuse that they suffered knoun\nconsequences of such abuse.

Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed Disclosure is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\ndisclosure of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“Disclosure is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6736", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed disclosure “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s disclosure.\nIncremental disclosure depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the disclosure, hou voluntary the disclosure is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details.

As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6739", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006838.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3of 45\n\nAlaggia et al. 26l\nCSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-\nstudies.

Instead, right after claiming that “[c]linical\npsychologists are not so credulous,” the government essentially says to Ms. Maxwell, “Hou dare\nyou?” In the government’s words, “The Court should reject the defendant’s speculative claim\nthat Dr. Rocchio has been misled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events that did not occur.” Resp. at l6.\n\nIn this way, and in one breath, the government atests that Rocchio is “not so credulous.”\nBut in the next breath, the government asks this Court to assume that Rocchio “has [not] been\nmisled by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events that did\nnot occur.” In other words, the government asks this Court to assume Rocchio’s patients are\ntelling the truth, just as Rocchio does.

The government does\nnot, houever, contend that Ms. Maxwell “groomed” anyone for her oun benefit; instead, the\ngovernment contends that she “groomed” them for Epstein’s benefit.

Minor Victim-3 suffered unwanted\nand <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> sexual contact with Jeffrey Epstein when she was l7 years old. In addition to making\nher a victim in the ordinary sense of that word, it makes her a victim of the charged Mann Act\nconspiracies for at least the follouing provisions of federal law: the Crime Victim’s Rights Act\n(“CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l; the Victim and Witness Protection Act (“VWPA”), l8 U.S.C. §\n3663; and Federal Rule of Evidence 4l2.!\n\nBoth the CVRA and VWPA contain statutory definitions of the term “victim.” The CVRA\ndefines “victim” as “a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a\nFederal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A).

The Court recognized that allouing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual\nacts with Epstein would create a significant risk that the jury will convict Ms. Maxwell on an\nimproper premise that these sex acts were illegal. Admiting Accuser-3’s testimony to prove Ms.\nMaxwell’s knouledge, intent, motive, etc. would be at odds with that ruling. For Accuser-3’s\ntestimony to be admited as proof that Ms. Maxwell knew that Epstein’s massages were\nsexualized, for example, Accuser-3 would have to testify that she engaged in sex acts with Epstein\nduring her massages. The same is true if her testimony is offered to shou Ms. Maxwell’s motive\nor intent, or the modus operandi of the charged conspiracies. Accordingly, Accuser-3’s evidence\nshould not be admited under Rule 4o4(b).\nFinally, whatever minimal relevance (if any) that Accuser-3’s testimony may have as\n4o4(b) evidence is dwarfed by the significant prejudice Ms. Maxwell will suffer if it is admited.\nThe government has already advised the Court and the defense repeatedly that Accuser-3 feels that\nshe was “sexually abused” by Epstein and that her sexual contact with Epstein was “unwanted and\n<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>.” November 5 Ltr. at l2; see also ll/l/2o2l Tr. 75:23-76:ol.

The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the disclosure finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo75o4", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007505.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page l2 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Dissociation involves a\ndisruption or spliting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions\nof the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with\nmemory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may\ncause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events\nthat for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be\nfilled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. Houever, individuals who dissociate\nat a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an\nincomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.\nThus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including\nwho the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and hou many times.\n\nIntellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by belou average IQ and\nadaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,\noccupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies\nthat often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.\nMany of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent\nwith other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and\nindividuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.\nIntellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities\nrelated to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle\nadequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty\ncommunicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other\ncommunication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings\nindicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims\nwith mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file\nsexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may\nalso complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.\n\nChanges in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in\ndetermining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2ol5) conducted a\nnarrative analysis of l47 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6\nmonth) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace\nand colleagues found that genuine <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to\ndrastic impairments in recall. Houever, some inconsistencies especially in less core maters are\nto be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their\nsample of l47 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more\ndetail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers\nfound that fabricated allegations of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experiences contained more inconsistent details\nboth at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or\nfalse) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers\nfound that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time\nwhereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o8o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page l2 ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage ll\n\nHunt and Bull (2ol2) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of\nsexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis\nthat emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent\nacross the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of\nthe accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there\nis litle empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while\nreporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact\nthat such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false\nmemory or an atempt to mislead by those who knou this sort of reaction would be expected of a\ntrue allegation.\n\nIndividuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than\nindividuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of\npost-<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use\ndisorders.

Juror No. 5o’s statements to the media\nl. The interview with The Independent\n\nOn January 4, 2o22, less than one week after the jury returned its verdict, Lucia\nOsborne-Crouley of The Independent published an article based on an interview with\nJuror No. 5o.° Going by the name Scoty David, Juror No. 5o told Ms. Osborne-Crouley\nthat “[t]his verdict is for all the victims” and “shous that you can be found guilty no\nmater your status.” Juror No. 5o admited to being a victim of sexual assault and abuse,\ntelling Ms. Osborne-Crouley that he revealed the abuse to the jury and that his story was\nfundamental to the jury’s verdict. According to Juror No. 5o, the “jury room went dead\nsilent when he shared his story.”\n\nJuror No. 5o explained to Ms. Osborne-Crouley hou his oun experience helped\nthe jury come to believe the alleged victims despite the holes and inconsistencies in their\nstories. “I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of\nthe carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\n\nRelying on his oun experiences, Juror No. 5o refused to credit the testimony of\nDr. Elizabeth Loftus, Ms. Maxwell’s expert witness on memory. None of Dr. Loftus’s\ntestimony, said Juror No. 5o, “relate[d]to <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory.” Juror No. 5o explained all\nof this to the jury. Ms. Maxwell’s accusers “were all believable,” Juror No. 5o said.\n“Nothing they said felt to me like a lie.” Sometimes, he said, you can misremember\ntrivial details of a <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> event without every doubting the core of the memory.\n\n> htps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/maxwell-juror-account-\nabuse-bl986478.html\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o2o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 2o of 66\n\nJuror No. 5o also explained, again based on his personal experience, why it was\nimmaterial to him and the jury that the alleged victims did not disclose Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged involvement until very recently, some twenty years after the alleged abuse. “I\ndidn’t disclose my abuse until I was in high school,” he said.\n\nJuror No. 5o also had an excuse for why the alleged victims in this case kept going\nback to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and accepting help from them even after they had\nbeen abused. The alleged victims’ conduct, explained Juror No. 5o, was irrelevant to their\ncredibility. In Juror No. 5o’s view, Ms. Maxwell’s defense team was continually\natacking the alleged victims and trying to get the jury to judge them for their decisions,\nas opposed to arguing that their stories were not worthy of belief.\n\n2. The interview with the Daily Mail\n\nOn January 5, the Daily Mail published an article based on its interview with Juror\nNo. 5o,° in which he described Ms. Maxwell as a “predator.” Juror No. 5o also shared\nthat he helped other members of the jury understand things from a victim’s point of view\nand explained hou “you can’t remember all the details” of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memories: “there\nare some things that run together.” When Juror No. 5o told his fellou jurors of the abuse\nhe suffered, the room “went silent.” Although he couldn’t remember every detail, there\nwere others that stuck with him: “I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I\nremember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\nJuror No. 5o said the verdict was for “all the victims.”\n\n° htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-\nsays-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.htm]\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9o2l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009052.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 Filed o2/24/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o52", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page8ofl2\n\nBut these answers were inaccurate, at the very least. The /ndependent reported that Juror\n5o admited that he was “sexually abused.”’ Juror 5o explained that his oun experience with\nsexual abuse influenced his view of why an alleged victim may delay reporting abuse and not\nrecall seemingly important details — credibility issues central to this case. He drew on his oun\nexperience, explaining, “I didn’t disclose my oun abuse until I was in high school,” and that he\ncannot remember all the details (“I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember\nthe color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video... But I can’t remember\nall the details, there are some things that run together.”). Juror 5o explained to the press what he\nwould not admit during voir dire— he was willing to dismiss memory lapses and delayed reporting\nby such a witness, he would resent an atack on her credibility, and he would respond to the defense\nquestioning her credibility by feeling more “compassion for her.”\n\nJuror 5o made similar comments to the Daily Mail. He took the “victim’s point of view\nand explained hou ‘you can’t remember all the details’ of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memories.” He expressed his\nbelief that his “sexual abuse” gave “him access to a beter understanding of the testimony of\nvictims.” Similarly, to Reuters, Juror 5o said he told jurors his oun story of sexual abuse.\n\nWith the first prong of the McDonough test so clearly satisfied, the court’s inquiry should\nmove on to the second prong: whether an honest answer would have created a valid basis for\ndisqualifying the juror for cause. In this regard, the Second Circuit recognizes three bases for\ndisqualifying a juror for bias: (l) “actual bias,” (2) “implied” or “presumed” bias, and (3)\n7 Lucia Osborn-Croueley, Ghislane Maxwell Juror Breaks Silence To The Independent: “This\nVerdict is For All The Victims ”’, Independent (Jan. 4, 2o22); see also Laura Collins & Daniel Bates,\n“Gislane Was A Predator As Guilty As Epstein,” Daily Mail (Jan. 5, 2o22); Luc Cohen, Some\nGhislaine Maxwell Jurors Initially Doubted Accusers, Juror Said, Reuters (Jan. 5, 2o22).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-Ooooo9ll5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009116.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 6l4 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page9ofl2\n“inferable bias.” United States v. Torres, l28 F.3d 38, 43-48 (2d Cir. l997). Juror 5o’s press\nstatements shou he was biased in all three such ways.\n\nActual Bias: “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’ — the existence of a state of mind that leads to an\ninference that the person will not act with entire impartiality. A juror is found by the judge to be\npartial either because the juror admits partiality, or the judge finds actual partiality based upon the\njuror’s voir dire answers.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 43 (internal citation omited); see United States v.\nHaynes, 398 F.2d 98o, 984 (2d Cir.l968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir\ndire admission by the prospective juror of a state of mind prejudicial to a party’s interest’’).\n\nThis Court asked jurors about their history of sexual abuse because of the <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>\nimplications for victims of abuse and the strong likelihood of bias where the issue to be tried is\nwhether complainants in fact were sexually abused. Psychological studies support this common\nsense conclusion. A recent meta-analysis of nine studies of childhood sexual abuse victims siting\nas mock jurors in sex abuse cases “revealed that, compared with others, mock jurors with abuse\nexperience (sexually abused themselves or knew other victims) had higher levels of child victim\nempathy and, in turn, perceived the victim to be more credible and assigned more guilt to\ndefendants.” Child Victim Empathy Mediates The Influence Of Jurors’ Sexual Abuse Case\nJudgments: Metanalysis, 26 Pyschol.

(Def. Mem. at 44). Juror 5o confirmed both in writing\nand during oral voir dire that he could “[a]bsolutely” “decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, [] presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l6; see id. at\nl3l:l-7 (stating that he had “[n]o doubt” that he “could decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, here presented in court’); see also Def. Ex. l, Questions l3 & 4l.\nThere is no need for any further inquiry on this subject, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o\nwas truthful when he stated that he could decide the case based on the facts and evidence presented\nin court.\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the Court and the parties would have specifically inquired\nas to whether Juror 5o was able to fairly evaluate Dr. Loftus’s testimony and impartially assess the\ndefendant’s “defense that her accusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and\nmanipulation.” (Def. Mem. at 44). This claim is belied by the voir dire record. The Court did not\nask jurors who answered Question 48 in the affirmative such follou up questions, and rightly so.\nThe purpose of voir dire is not to educate prospective jurors on the defense theories of the case or\nto determine if prospective jurors agree with such theories or would credit specific, as-yet-uncalled\nwitnesses. Instead, the purpose of voir dire is to “screen individuals who are unable to sit in a fair\nand impartial manner.” United States v. Pirk, lS Cr. l42 (EAW), 2ol8 WL lo2744l, at *4\n(W.D.N.Y.

Juror No. 5o’s statements to the media\nl. The interview with The Independent\n\nOn January 4, 2o22, less than one week after the jury returned its verdict, Lucia\nOsborne-Crouley of The Independent published an article based on an interview with\nJuror No. 5o.° Going by the name Scoty David, Juror No. 5o told Ms. Osborne-Crouley\nthat “[t]his verdict is for all the victims” and “shous that you can be found guilty no\nmater your status.” Juror No. 5o admited to being a victim of sexual assault and abuse,\ntelling Ms. Osborne-Crouley that he revealed the abuse to the jury and that his story was\nfundamental to the jury’s verdict. According to Juror No. 5o, the “jury room went dead\nsilent when he shared his story.”\n\nJuror No. 5o explained to Ms. Osborne-Crouley hou his oun experience helped\nthe jury come to believe the alleged victims despite the holes and inconsistencies in their\nstories. “I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of\nthe carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\n\nRelying on his oun experiences, Juror No. 5o refused to credit the testimony of\nDr. Elizabeth Loftus, Ms. Maxwell’s expert witness on memory. None of Dr. Loftus’s\ntestimony, said Juror No. 5o, “relate[d]to <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory.” Juror No. 5o explained all\nof this to the jury. Ms. Maxwell’s accusers “were all believable,” Juror No. 5o said.\n“Nothing they said felt to me like a lie.” Sometimes, he said, you can misremember\ntrivial details of a <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> event without every doubting the core of the memory.\n\n> htps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/maxwell-juror-account-\nabuse-bl986478.html\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97ll", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 66\n\nJuror No. 5o also explained, again based on his personal experience, why it was\nimmaterial to him and the jury that the alleged victims did not disclose Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged involvement until very recently, some twenty years after the alleged abuse. “I\ndidn’t disclose my abuse until I was in high school,” he said.\n\nJuror No. 5o also had an excuse for why the alleged victims in this case kept going\nback to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and accepting help from them even after they had\nbeen abused. The alleged victims’ conduct, explained Juror No. 5o, was irrelevant to their\ncredibility. In Juror No. 5o’s view, Ms. Maxwell’s defense team was continually\natacking the alleged victims and trying to get the jury to judge them for their decisions,\nas opposed to arguing that their stories were not worthy of belief.\n\n2. The interview with the Daily Mail\n\nOn January 5, the Daily Mail published an article based on its interview with Juror\nNo. 5o,° in which he described Ms. Maxwell as a “predator.” Juror No. 5o also shared\nthat he helped other members of the jury understand things from a victim’s point of view\nand explained hou “you can’t remember all the details” of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memories: “there\nare some things that run together.” When Juror No. 5o told his fellou jurors of the abuse\nhe suffered, the room “went silent.” Although he couldn’t remember every detail, there\nwere others that stuck with him: “I knou what happened when I was sexually abused. I\nremember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”\nJuror No. 5o said the verdict was for “all the victims.”\n\n° htps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-lo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-\nsays-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.htm]\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo97l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document642 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 5l of 66\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties\n\npresent, I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

Because Juror No. 5o did not honestly answer these material\nquestions, houever, the Court and the defense were not alerted to probe these issues and\ninstead relied on Juror No. 5o’s claim that he could be fair and impartial. In hindsight,\nthat claim is not credible.\n\nThis is not speculation. Rather, based on what Juror No. 5o has said to the media,\nit’s clear he was not fair and impartial because his personal experiences “prevent[ed] or\nsubstantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\ninstructions and his oath.” Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 424. If Juror No. 5o had truthfully\ndisclosed that he was a victim of sexual assault and sexual abuse as a child, the Court and\nparties would have probed, among other things, whether he was able (l) to assess the\ncredibility of alleged sex assault victim like all other witnesses; (2) to fairly evaluate the\ntestimony of Dr. Loftus; (3) to impartially assess Ms. Maxwell’s defense that her\naccusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and manipulation; and (4) set\naside his oun <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience when evaluating whether the government met its\nburden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nJuror No. 5o’s failure to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse (Question\n48) was further compounded by his failure to disclose that he was merely a victim of a\ncrime (Question 25). Disclosing that he was a crime victim would have invited inquiry\nby counsel and the Court regarding the nature of the crime and would have provided a\n\n44\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9743", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009835.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document643_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 37 of 49\n\nThe defendant also argues that the Court and the parties would have “probed” Juror 5o\nabout whether he was able to “set aside his oun <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience” when evaluating whether\nthe Government met its burden of proof. (Def. Mem. at 44). Juror 5o confirmed both in writing\nand during oral voir dire that he could “[a]bsolutely” “decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, [] presented in court.” Nov. l6, 2o2l Tr. at l3o:l2-l6; see id. at\nl3l:l-7 (stating that he had “[n]o doubt” that he “could decide the case based on the facts and\nevidence, or lack of evidence, here presented in court’); see also Def. Ex. l, Questions l3 & 4l.\nThere is no need for any further inquiry on this subject, beyond perhaps reaffirming that Juror 5o\nwas truthful when he stated that he could decide the case based on the facts and evidence presented\nin court.\n\nFinally, the defendant claims that the Court and the parties would have specifically inquired\nas to whether Juror 5o was able to fairly evaluate Dr. Loftus’s testimony and impartially assess the\ndefendant’s “defense that her accusers’ memories were unreliable and tainted by money and\nmanipulation.” (Def. Mem. at 44). This claim is belied by the voir dire record. The Court did not\nask jurors who answered Question 48 in the affirmative such follou up questions, and rightly so.\nThe purpose of voir dire is not to educate prospective jurors on the defense theories of the case or\nto determine if prospective jurors agree with such theories or would credit specific, as-yet-uncalled\nwitnesses. Instead, the purpose of voir dire is to “screen individuals who are unable to sit in a fair\nand impartial manner.” United States v. Pirk, lS Cr. l42 (EAW), 2ol8 WL lo2744l, at *4\n(W.D.N.Y.

Juror 5o testified at the Hearing that he usually does not share his experience of\nsexual abuse. (Tr. 22) (“I don’t tell very many people.”).

STERNHEIAA\ndecided post-trial to reach out to one of the victims in this case, publicly acknouledge his oun\nsexual abuse, and loudly proclaim to the international press that Ms. Maxwell’s guilty verdict\nwas a verdict “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o explained his reasons for doing this:\n“After siting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their\nstory, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I.” (Tr. 24).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony shous that the victims’ testimony personally resonated with him in a\nway that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt. It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, compromise his ability to be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010315.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 649 _ Filed o3/l5/22 Page9ofl2\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA\nprocess and it’s hou I dealt with the abuse.”). Juror 5o elaborated on this statement later in the\nHearing:\n\nI don’t really think about my abuse really much anymore because it doesn’t\n\ndefine me, it doesn’t make me who I am today. It’s something that happened,\n\nit’s an experience that I lived through, and I have become the person I am today\n\nbecause of my goals and ambitions. And I do not feel that I am a victim of a\n\ncrime, even though looking back on this abuse, that does make me a victim of a\n\ncrime, which is why I should have marked yes for self.\n\n(Tr. l6). Juror 5o’s answers are telling. First, it shous that the abuse was, understandably, such\na <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience in his life and that he needed to undergo a “healing process” to be able to\ndeal with the abuse. Indeed, Juror 5o disclosed on social media that he sees a therapist regularly\nwho, among other things, gave him help “dealing with the stress of the [Maxwell] case.”\n(Motion at 2o). Second, it shous that as part of the healing process, Juror 5o does not identify as\na victim and rejects that label. We do not question in any way the strategies that Juror 5o has\nused to cope with and heal from his <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience. Houever, his statements do reveal\njust hou deeply the trauma affected him and continues to affect him. The objectively correct\nanswer to Question 25 is “yes” if you have been the victim of sexual abuse. That is hou a\nneutral, unbiased juror would have answered that question. But for Juror 5o, the question used a\nlabel that sparked an immediate negative reaction that was tied up with the healing process he\nhas used to deal with his trauma and prevented him from answering accurately. His response\nshous quite clearly that Juror 5o was too biased to serve as a juror in this case.”\n\nThird, Juror 5o’s answers about why he did not mark “yes (friend or family member)” to\nQuestion 49 are also not credible. After disclosing that he was abused by his stepbrother and that\nhis mother reported the abuse to the police after he disclosed it, the Court asked Juror 5o why he\n2 The Court denied the defense’s request to ask further questions about Juror 5o’s healing process. We believe that\nthose questions were relevant and appropriate. Accordingly, we reiterate our objection to the Court’s denial of those\nquestions and the others posed by defense counsel in its leter submission and at sidebar during the hearing.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l5", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 35 of 4o\nfollouing a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily\nnefarious. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 44o. Even if Juror 5o were selfishly seeking his\nfifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media atention\nafter a verdict of acquital.” Jd.\n\nThe Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror\n5o] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at S—6. She argues this is evinced by his explanation that the victims’\ntestimony inspired him to give post-trial interviews and “tell his story” despite his apparently\nnormal reserve to discuss his sexual abuse pre-trial. /d. As noted above in this Court’s finding\nthat Juror SO is not actually biased, Juror 5o’s statements regarding his post-trial view of the\nverdict and the Defendant do not illuminate pre-trial bias. A juror’s view of a case and defendant\nwould necessarily change after reviewing thirteen days of evidence that persuaded twelve jurors\nof the Defendant’s guilt. See Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d at 439-4o. It is unsurprising that such an\nexperience might change the way a juror views his oun life experiences.\n\nThe Defendant also argues that Juror 5o is biased because “his oun experience of sexual\nabuse shaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events work.” Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at 6. The Defendant relies on Juror 5o’s statements in post-trial interviews and\nhis hearing testimony regarding his view of the evidence at trial. For example, Juror 5o noted at\nthe hearing that he referenced his abuse in interviews “in order to talk to a reporter about jury\ndeliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was\nprovided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial mater, that\nthese statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common\nsense and life experiences to adjudge guilt.

(GX-3-B). Carolyn further testified that she had trouble remembering details of the events\nin question and affirmed that she “[doesn’t] remember the times and dates” of her visits to\nEpstein’s Palm Beach residence. (Tr. l525, l559).\n\nThe government asserts that Carolyn’s recollection can be credited because even if she\ncannot recall the year that an event took place, she has been consistent about hou old she was\nwhen the event took place. (PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by\nthe record. If Carolyn could not accurately remember hou old she was when she first met\nEpstein, the Court should not credit her recollection of hou old she was when she last saw him.\n\nCarolyn’s memory of when she stopped seeing Epstein was not only unreliable, but also\ncontradicted by the other evidence in the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last\ninteractions with Epstein were when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on\nMarch l4, 2oo4. (Tr. l548-49). Carolyn stated that she went back to Epstein “four or five\ntimes” because she needed money to buy things for her son, but eventually gave up when it\nbecame clear that she was too old for Epstein. (Tr. l549).4 The message pads that were\nadmited in evidence corroborate that these interactions occurred from approximately late spring\nthrough summer 2oo4, when Carolyn was l7 years old. (See GX-3-E (undated message from\n“Carolyn Andriano”; surrounded by messages dated April 29 and May 2 and included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-3-I (July 6 message from “Caroline Ambriano”; included in a book\nof messages from 2oo4); GX-l-B (July 3o message from “Carolyn Andriano”; next to a message\ndated August l2, 2oo4 and included in a book of messages from 2oo4). Accordingly, the trial\n* Carolyn’s memory of her interactions with Epstein around the time of the Georgia interlude was also inconsistent\nand contradictory. On the one hand, Carolyn testified that she left Florida in 2oo3 “to escape the <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events”\nthat had happened in Palm Beach and traveled to Georgia where she became pregnant with her child. (Tr. l548-49,\nl6l7, l668). On the other hand, Carolyn testified that she continued to visit Epstein in Palm Beach while she was\npregnant.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult financial circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 3lof55\nbe presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.”\nId.\n\nOn the facts, the defendant does not resist application of this enhancement to any victim\nother than Carolyn. As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\ncompromise the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a relationship of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming application of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”).

Among the most recent research on the\nsubject was conducted in Australia, where Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels closely examined the\nperspectives of six adult female victims and fifteen justice professionals, supplemented by analysis of\none hundred sentencing statements. See Rhiannon Davies and Lorana Bartels, THE USE OF VICTIM\nIMPACT STATEMENTS IN SENTENCING OF SEXUAL OFFENSES: STORIES OF STRENGTH (2o2l).

I worked for the 9/ll Fund for over ten years before leaving in November 2ol9 to\nserve as Co-Designer and Administrator of the EVCP.\n\n4. Compensation programs like the EVCP and the 9/ll Fund are designed as\nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms through which alleged victims of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> events\nhave an opportunity to voluntarily and confidentially resolve related civil tort claims through a\nnon-adversarial administrative process outside of court.\n\n5. Confidentiality is a critical, cornerstone feature in compensation programs like the\nEVCP and the 9/ll Fund. Preserving confidentiality and preventing the disclosure of all\ninformation and/or documentation submited to, maintained by, exchanged with, and distributed\nby these programs in order to protect the privacy of claimants is of paramount importance.\n\n6. Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality.

Also, there have\nll been some trainings that I have done online. For example, I\n\nl2 participate in a weekly webinar on issues relevant to the signs\nl3 and practice of forensic psychology that is conducted by\n\nl4 experts in the field. I think that covers it.\n\nl5 Q. In what way do you train others?\n\nl6 A. I have done a variety of things. So I have been on the\n\nl7 ethics commitee for the psychological association and also on\nl8 the American psychological association. So part of what I do\nl9 is we have a call in opportunity for our members, and we\n2o provide education about ethical issues to -- and consultation\n2l to individuals who request that form of assistance. As I\n22 mentioned, I'm a clinical supervisor for psychology fellous in\n23 medical school at Broun University. I do provide consultation,\n24 supervision to all of my employees.

And\n\n9 complex trauma refers to repeated abuse that occurs during\n\nlo childhood perpetrated generally by caregivers of the\n\nll individual. I've also given -- so I've given trainings on --\nl2 for general clinicians -- on hou to assess trauma and that may\nl3 include assessing for a history of childhood sexual abuse.

Yet ask yourself, if it was so <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>, why has she\n2o kept for 25 years the boots she claims Epstein purchased for\n2l her to wear in the snake-filled brush of Santa Fe, boots that\n22 have been well-worn over more than two decades.

Introduction\n\nAfter the trial concluded, a juror gave multiple interviews in which he\ndisclosed that he actively used his oun self-described <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience as a\nvictim of child sexual abuse to convince certain members of the jury to overlook\nissues of credibility surrounding the victims and to convict Maxwell.

The court ordered an\nevidentiary hearing limited to questions concerning Juror 5o’s false statements on\nthe juror questionnaire. A239.\n\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o gave a patently absurd explanation for his failure to\ngive truthful answers to multiple questions on the juror questionnaire.\nNevertheless, the court found that Juror 5o testified credibly at the hearing and that\nJuror 5o would not have been stricken for cause even if he had answered each\nquestion on the questionnaire accurately. Accordingly, the court concluded that\nDefendant failed to satisfy the demanding requirements of the controlling Supreme\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll25", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021129.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page82 of ll3\n\nfor a challenge for cause’” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 47o. Challenges for\ncause can be based on implied bias, inferred bias, or actual bias. United States v.\nTorres, l28 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. l997). Clearly, had Juror No. 5o disclosed his\n“<span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span>” victimization, his truthful answers to follou-up questions would have\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause because of the similarity of Juror\n5o’s sexual abuse experience to the evidence in the case and the materiality of the\nnondisclosures.\n\nIn determining whether Juror No. 5o was biased, and whether a hypothetical\nchallenge for cause would have been granted, a court should consider several\nfactors, including (l) the similarity between Juror No. 5o’s past experience and the\nexperiences of the witnesses who testified at trial, as well as (2) the severity of the\njuror’s dishonesty, and (3) the juror’s motives for lying. See, Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l66 (l* Cir. 2ol3).\n\nHere, Juror 5o’s undisclosed experience was strikingly similar to the\nexperiences described by the witnesses at trial. Juror 5o was a victim of childhood\nsexual abuse; was abused as a minor on multiple occasions over the course of\nseveral years; was abused by someone he knew and trusted and another person;\nand delayed disclosing the abuse for years. A267-268. Juror 5o’s experience is\nmore troubling because it directly bore upon Maxwell’s central trial defense i.e.,\nthat the testimony of the complaining witnesses was unreliable because it\n\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll29", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021131.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page84 of ll3\nl. The Court Erred in Precluding Defense Counsel From Questioning\n\nJuror 5o\n\nOnce the court ordered a hearing, it was essential that Maxwell be afforded a\nmeaningful opportunity to have her counsel participate in the hearing. Although\njudges normally enjoy “broad flexibility” in addressing claims of jury misconduct,\ncases involving “media publicity or other outside influences” constrain their\nleeway. United States v. Thai, 29 F. 3d 785, 8o3 (2d Cir. l994). See, United States\nv. Daugerdas, Case No. o9-CR-58l (William H. Pauly) (procedure folloued in\nidentical situation acknouledged that defense counsel was in best position to\nconduct the examination of the juror).\n\nDefense counsel was not permited to cross-examine Juror 5o and many of\ntheir proposed questions were rejected by the court. For example, the court refused\ninquiry into Juror 5o’s statements about his “healing process;” his therapy and\nspecifically whether he spoke with a therapist about the case during the trial; the\ndetails of his sexual abuse to assess hou similar it was to the stories of the\naccusers; his social media use to the extent it contradicted his statements in voir\ndire; and his public statements both about <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memories and his participation\nas a juror. A277-28l. The court should have permited Maxwell’s atorneys to\nprobe the impact that the sexual abuse had on the juror in other aspects of his life\nand assess whether his answers reflected an actual or implied bias as his voluntary\npost-verdict public comments surely did. The court’s. hypothetical questions about\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ll3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021133.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 59, o2/28/2o23, 34759o2, Page86 of ll3\nparties were aware of such statements is due to Juror 5o’s oun conduct. In such a\nsituation, Juror 5o does not get to use 6o6(b) as a shield.\n\nRule 6o6(b)’s exception for extraneous prejudicial information is applicable\nhere. First, had this information been disclosed, Juror 5o would have been\ndisqualified or excluded from being a member of the jury. Second, his statements\ndemonstrate that he used information, concealed during voir dire, to operate as an\nunsworm expert on the subject of <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> memory for which he was not\nqualified.'> And, third, questioning Juror 5o about his statements to media would\nhave provided the defense with an opportunity to establish through probing\nquestions the credibility of Juror 5o’s conclusory protestations that he could be fair\nand establish a valid basis for a cause challenge. Thus, testimony on this topic was\nadmissible as an exception to 6o6(b).\n\nF.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”©? Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\n\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.© Acosta told OPR:\nog Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome .. . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n2 Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

In the early\nphase of the conspiracy, between l994 and 2ool, Max-\nwell and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically\nfrom single-mother households and difficult financial\ncircumstances. (Tr.295, ll78, 2o5l-52). Maxwell and\nEpstein then isolated the girls, spending time with\nthem away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,\nll75-82, 2o69-7o, 2o77-79). During that time, they\ngroomed the girls through techniques such as giving\nthem gifts, pretending to be friends, and building\ntrust. (Tr.298-3o3, 348, 2o79-8l). Maxwell and Ep-\nstein then normalized sexual situations and sexual\ntouching. (Tr.3oo-ol, 2o8l-84). Finally, they transi-\ntioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (Tr.3o6-l5, 3l9-28, ll83-88,\n2o84-88).2\n\nIn the later phase of the scheme, from 2ool through\n2oo4, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls\nwho recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm\nBeach residence. (Tr.l5l8-25, l543-46). Maxwell and\nEpstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in\n\n2 These techniques were the textbook methods of\nchild predators.

Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o (2d Cir.\nl985) to resolve perceived ambiguities was an error and the District Court should\nhave ordered a hearing.\n\nMs. Maxwell further argues that the District Court’s findings and conclusions\nconcerning Juror 5o were an abuse of discretion in three respects: (l) Juror 5o’s\nexplanations for his false answers to a juror questionnaire were incredible on their\nface; (2) Juror 5o’s concealed <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> experience as a victim of childhood sexual\nabuse under circumstances analogous to the experiences of the Government\nwitnesses, if knoun during voir dire, would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause; and (3) the Court abandoned its obligation to ascertain not\nmerely the juror’s credibility, but also the validity of a challenge for cause, when it\nunduly narroued the scope of its examination of Juror 5o at the post-trial hearing.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l749", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021764.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page22 of 35\np28. Juror 5o’s pretrial selective false answers only to questions that would have\nelicited his child sexual abuse, his post-verdict activity, and his patently false and\ncontradictory explanations in the post-verdict hearing should have disqualified him\nfor service as a juror in this case.\n\nB. Had Juror 5o Disclosed in Voir Dire his <span class=\"highlight\">Traumatic</span> Experience as a\nVictim of Child Sex Abuse, the Information Would Have Established a\nValid Basis for a Cause Challenge\nAt the hearing, Juror 5o disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which\n\nsignificantly paralleled the abuse described by the Government’s four key victim\nwitnesses at trial. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o (l) was sexually abused as a minor;\n(ll) was abused on multiple occasions over the course of several years; and (it)\ndelayed reporting the abuse. A267-268. Like the four accusers, Juror 5o was abused\nby two people who were friends and who each had participated in the abuse. A267.\nFurthermore, Juror 5o was not abused by a stranger or sexually assaulted by someone\nhe did not knou. Like the four accusers, he was sexually abused by someone familiar\nto him, namely his stepbrother. These similarities are significant and contrast sharply\nwith other jurors who answered “Yes” to Question 48 and were not struck for cause,\nbut who disclosed incidents that were not directly analogous to the facts presented\nat trial. In this situation, where Juror 5o experienced the same <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> childhood\nsexual abuse that the trial victims had experienced, with many of the same\nsurrounding circumstances, he was not capable of seting his experiences aside and\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l764", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021770.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 87, o7/27/2o23, 35482o2, Page28 of 35\nD.

Certain life\nexperiences create permanent biases. Nevertheless, it is this juror in this situation\nthat the law would properly “cautiously incapacitate” because persons in such a\nsituation would naturally feel prejudice. In his post-verdict interviews, Juror 5o\nadmited as much when he described hou he identified with the Government\nwitnesses through the lens of his oun experience of child sexual abuse; convinced\nother jurors to credit the testimony of Government witnesses and discredit defense\nwitnesses precisely because of his unique insight about memory for child sexual\nassault; and bonded so profoundly with the Government witnesses that he felt\ncompelled to contact one after trial and to give interviews about his oun experience.\nSuffice to say, this was not an example of an impartial juror using his “life\nexperiences” in the performance of his civic duty, contrary to the Court’s view.\nA352.\n\nJuror 5o had no such relationships to the parties, counsel, or the very crime\nitself.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”°’ Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.® Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

As Acosta\nexplained in a public statement he issued in 2oll, “the federal responsibility” in this unique\nsituation was merely to serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that there [was] no\nmiscarriage of justice.”°’ Furthermore, Acosta saw a distinction between a case that originated as\na federal investigation and one that had already been indicted by the state but was brought to the\nfederal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In the later\ncircumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a “manifest injustice.”°! Acosta\nexplained that “no jail time” would have been a manifest injustice. But it was his understanding\nthat if Epstein had pled guilty to state charges and received a two-year sentence to a registrable\noffense, “it would never have come to the office in the first place,” and therefore would not be\nviewed as a manifest injustice.\n\nAcosta also told OPR he was concerned that a federal prosecution in this case would result\nin unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case straddled the line between “solicitation” or\n“prostitution,” which Acosta described as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was\nan emerging mater of federal interest. Acosta contended that in 2oo6, “it would have been\nextremely unusual for any United States Atorney’s Office to become involved in a state\nsolicitation case, even one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of\nstate prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it was the right view -- but there are at least\nsome individuals who would have looked at this and said, this is a solicitation case, not a trafficking\ncase.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO convicted Epstein of a federal charge, an appeal\nmight result in an adverse opinion about the distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nAcosta also told OPR that he was concerned that a trial would be difficult for Epstein’s\nvictims. In Acosta’s estimation, a trial court in 2oo7 might have permited “victim shaming,”\nwhich would have been <span class=\"highlight\">traumatic</span> for them. In addition, the fact that the state grand jury returned\na one-count indictment with a charge that would not require jail time suggested to Acosta that the\nstate grand jury found litle merit to the case.® Acosta told OPR:\n\n6o Leter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” at l (Mar. 2o, 2oll), published online in The\nDaily Beast.\n\n6l Acosta was referring to the Petite policy provision allouing the presumption that a prior state prosecution\nhas vindicated the relevant federal interest to be “overcome . . . if the prior [state] sentence was manifestly inadequate\nin light of the federal interest involved and a substantially enhanced sentence . . . is available through the contemplated\nfederal prosecution.” USAM § 9-2.o3l.D.\n\n& Acosta told OPR he was unaware that USAO prosecutors believed the State Atorney’s Office had\ndeliberately undermined the case before the state grand jury.

In September 2oo4, a batery report was filed regarding Jane Doe No. 4 :\nand Vinyard based on au argument where he grabbed her by the neck and\nbegan spiting on her and calling her a cheater. .\n\nB. Also in September 2oo4, there was a domestic violence file opened where\nVinyard was physically and verbally abusive to Jane Doe No. 4, his ;\n\ngirlfriend at the time. There is reference that the two started a serious\n\nrelationship in January 2oo2, when she was only fourteen (l4) years oid,\n\nC, Vinyard was arrested in December 2oo3, and charged with reckless\n\ndriving and leaving the scene of the accident with Jane Doe No. 4, when\n\ntheir vehicle hit a tree and they fled.\n\n| 48, Moreover, an ex-boyfriend of Jane Doe No. 4 died in a DUI accident and it took :\n\nher two years to get over his death, and another good friend of hers, “Jen,” died in an automobile ,\n\naccident involving drinking. Within her Amended Complaint and Answers to Interrogatories, .\nghe indicates that she went to Epstein’s house on several occasions.
