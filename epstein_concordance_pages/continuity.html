As previously\nnoted, the Government has made and will continue to make significant efforts to ensure that the\ndefense is able to prepare for trial as scheduled. Moreover, delay of the trial would prejudice the\nvictims in this case, multiple of whom oppose any adjournment.

So just give me an example of\n\n4 the kind of testimony he would provide there.\n\na) MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n6 So, for examole, within the message pads, we published\n\n7 yesterday, I think, just either two or three specific messages\n\n8 that had a first and last name of someone and a phone number.\n\n9 But elsewhere throughout the message pads, there appear entries\nlo that only have a first name, and sometimes that entry is, for\nll example, Carolyn and sometimes it's Caroline. But when you\nl2 compare the phone numbers -- and there are a variety of\nl3 different phone numbers throughout the book -- it becomes clear\nl4 that Caroline is the same Carolyn, first and last name, as some\nl5 of the other messages, because there's <span class=\"highlight\">continuity</span> between the\nl6 phone numbers.\n\nl7 And there are a variety of different phone numbers\nl8 throughout the exhibits with different names like Carolyn,\nl9 Caroline, and Carolyn with a last name. And reviewing them and\n2o analyzing them makes it clear throughout the books and across a\n2l variety of different dates that we're talking about the same\n22 person. And so that facilitates both publishing the exhibits\n23 so that the jury can see them for the first time, and doing\n24 that in a way that sort of connects up those different\n25 exhibits.

His testimony will be\n4 limited to his analysis of exhibits; he won't be analyzing\n\n5 testimony of other witnesses.\n\n6 There are a number of exhibits in this case which have\n7 not yet been published or reviewed during the course of this\n\n8 case; and so we anticipate fairly brief testimony from Special\n9 Agent Buscemi about his review of several exhibits.\n\nlo In short, the testimony will concern, among other\n\nll things, the message pads, the majority of which have not been\nl2 published or viewed by the jury at this point. And the purpose\nl3 of the testimony is to connect up several exhibits and review\nl4 them in a way to make those exhibits clear to the jury and\n\nl5 publish them to shou, for example, the <span class=\"highlight\">continuity</span> of certain\n\nl6 phone numbers and names, where they change over time, where\n\nl7 they are in the message books in order to make that clear for\nl8 the jury.\n\nl9 I anticipate that the testimony from Special Agent\n2o Buscemi would be likely something like l5 to 2o minutes, maybe\n2l slightly more, again, just talking about exhibits and the\n22 Similarity of phone numbers and names between a variety of\n23 different exhibits. That's the scope of his testimony.\n24 Our view is that's consistent with the way summary\n25 witnesses are called in many trials in this district and\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9l3l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019132.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 757 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 8 of 49 l98l\nLCOVMAXT\n\nl doesn't exceed the scope of the ordinary practice.\n\n2 THE COURT: Let's take the specific example that\n\n3 you've given on message pads. So just give me an example of\n\n4 the kind of testimony he would provide there.\n\na) MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n\n6 So, for examole, within the message pads, we published\n\n7 yesterday, I think, just either two or three specific messages\n\n8 that had a first and last name of someone and a phone number.\n\n9 But elsewhere throughout the message pads, there appear entries\nlo that only have a first name, and sometimes that entry is, for\nll example, Carolyn and sometimes it's Caroline. But when you\nl2 compare the phone numbers -- and there are a variety of\nl3 different phone numbers throughout the book -- it becomes clear\nl4 that Caroline is the same Carolyn, first and last name, as some\nl5 of the other messages, because there's <span class=\"highlight\">continuity</span> between the\nl6 phone numbers.\n\nl7 And there are a variety of different phone numbers\nl8 throughout the exhibits with different names like Carolyn,\nl9 Caroline, and Carolyn with a last name. And reviewing them and\n2o analyzing them makes it clear throughout the books and across a\n2l variety of different dates that we're talking about the same\n22 person. And so that facilitates both publishing the exhibits\n23 so that the jury can see them for the first time, and doing\n24 that in a way that sort of connects up those different\n25 exhibits. And so that's the purpose of that testimony.\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9l32"};
