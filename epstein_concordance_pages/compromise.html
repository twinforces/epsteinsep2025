Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nindictment alleges 25-year-old conduct that supposedly occurred on unspecified dates in multiple\nlocations on different continents, and involves numerous alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein.\nMoreover, the government’s position is based on the claimed privacy rights of the alleged\nvictims, nou all adults, who may well have sued Mr. Epstein and/or Ms. Maxwell in public civil\nactions or otherwise identified themselves by name in public fora. As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. Disclosure of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient.

By\nthis Court’s order she is permited out of her approximately 9-by-7-foot isolation cell from 7:oo\nam to 8:oo pm, houever, she is frequently picked up late and returned to her cell promptly.\nWhen out of her cell, she is the sole inmate in a fenced off area of an unoccupied dormitory unit,\nwhere she eats, shouers, and reviews legal work while continually guarded by three officers.\n\nDespite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced back into a tiny\ncorner of the floor. She is needlessly kept in a 63-square-foot space. She gets very litle sleep,\nas she is frequently woken up by flashlights every l5 minutes, loud discussions among the\nguards, and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in\nsolitary confinement (she has nou been housed alone for well over loo days) and treated as if\nshe were on suicide watch even though she is not and has never been suicidal.\n\nThe psychological and physiological impact of solitary confinement is well documented.\nMs. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by virtue of the charges, brought this type of\nconfinement upon herself. This must be considered punishment.\n\nFurther, she has been required to stand for an hour waiting for the lieutenant to move her\nand during “the count” of inmates she is restricted to her bunk despite being housed in a one-\ninmate unit. She has at times been forced to do a standup count after midnight. Nou she is\nrequired to remain on a bed for the duration of the count.\n\nExcessive Scanning and Strip Searching: Ms. Maxwell is searched more frequently and\nextensively than any other pretrial detainee of which we are aware. All security scans to which\nMs. Maxwell have been subjected have returned negative results. Each time Ms. Maxwell is\nmoved from the isolation cell, she is searched and her cell is searched, and the dormitory is\nsearched prior to when she arrives at the dormitory area. Her cell and possessions including her\nlegal papers are searched after she has been moved to the dormitory. The process is repeated\nwhen Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. Recently, Ms. Maxwell was searched at\nleast five separate times and strip-searched twice during one day.\n\nMs. Maxwell is subjected to a body scans each week, and until recently, she received\napproximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything\ninside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans\non such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —\n* Undersigned counsel has represented clients charged with terrorism-related offenses confined to the\nmost restrictive unit in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Unit lo South, aka “the terrorist SHU”.

We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\n\" See htps:/Avww.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2ol6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00002992.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 58 of 239\nthe resurrection of time-barred prosecutions, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.'4 But that\nconcern is entirely separate from extending the statute of limitations for live claims, which is what\nCongress did here. Critically—and as discussed in greater detail belou—there is no Ex Post Facto\nClause issue in this case, because the statute of limitations for Counts One through Four had not\nyet expired when the limitations period was extended in 2oo3.\"\n\nAccepting the defendant’s argument would undermine Congress’s plain purpose in\nextending the limitations period. In l99o, 2oo3, and 2oo6, Congress extended—and ultimately\nabolished—the statute of limitations to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex\nabuse victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay. Applying the 2oo3 statute\nonly prospectively subverts that purpose by exempting all past offenders. According to the\n‘4 Moreover, the fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omited, retroactivity language does\nnot end the Landgraf inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this clear.\nIn that case, the statute at issue had a predecessor, which contained a retroactivity provision. That\nversion was vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omited the retroactivity\nprovision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he omission of the elaborate retroactivity\nprovision of the l99o bill—which was by no means the only source of political controversy over\nthat legislation—is not dispositive because it does not tell us precisely where the <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> was\nstruck in the l99l Act.” Landgraf, 5ll U.S. at 256. Indeed, “[i]t [was] entirely possible—indeed,\nhighly probable—that, because it was unable to resolve the retroactivity issue with the clarity of\nthe l99o legislation, Congress viewed the mater as an open issue to be resolved by the courts.”\nTd. at 26l.\n\n'S Minor Victim-l and Minor Victim-2 were both younger than 25 in 2oo3, when Congress\nextended the limitations period. Minor Victim-3 was not, but this does not alter the inquiry,\nbecause the Indictment does not contain any counts that relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instead,\nshe is one of multiple victims of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion\nof the overt acts relating to Minor Victim-3 in an otherwise timely conspiracy count does not\nrender that count untimely. To the contrary, for conspiracy counts, the Government is only\nrequired to prove that one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred within the limitations\nperiod. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242 F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2ool). Thus, the defendant is incorrect\nto assert that the government is “barred” from prosecuting the defendant for any offense against\nMinor Victim-3. (Def. Mot. 2 at lo, n.3). Instead, there is no statute of limitations issue here so\nlong as the jury is properly instructed at trial that it must find at least one overt act within the\nlimitations period—i.e., one overt act that does not relate to Minor Victim-3.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2992\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003101.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l67 of 239\nin a bankruptcy proceeding).

When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3265\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003269.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!\"°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3269\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003393.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>\nmeasure. *™\n\nB.

In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> them as\npotential witnesses.

On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day. Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003627.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7 of 3o\nrandom sample.

The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v.

Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise.

Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case.

When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4387\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 94 of 349\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.!!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “a significant <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-oooo439l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l8 of 349\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.7® Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>\nmeasure.*“4\n\nB.

In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> them as\npotential witnesses.

[and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nwl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\na2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005014.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 327 Filed o8/24/2l Page l of l\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nAugust 24, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government cannot resist the opportunity to gratuitously cast Ghislaine Maxwell in a\nnegative light while it defends the Metropolitan Detention Center at all costs, regardless of the facts.\n[Dkt. 326]. The government accuses Ms. Maxwell of using a cart to barricade the door to the VTC\nroom. The cart was never used to barricade. The government has chosen to make this an issue - when it\nnever was - to justify the restriction placed on the amount of legal materials Ms. Maxwell can bring into\nthe VTC room on any given day.\n\nThe government mischaracterizes facts to which it does not have first-hand knouledge.\nMs. Maxwell continues to use the cart daily to bring legal material into the VTC room and to remove\nthose documents at the end of the VTC session. Most of her legal papers are kept in a separate room.\nShe is only alloued to bring a certain portion of documents to any given VTC session and is not alloued\nto leave the VTC room to collect additional documents that may be needed for review and discussion\nwith counsel. The amount of legal material Ms. Maxwell can access depends upon rules that fluctuate\nwith each team rotated into the MDC every two weeks to guard her.\n\nThis limitation impacts the productivity of VTC and in-person legal conferences and\ncompromises Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial.\n\nVery truly yours,\n/s/\nBOBBI C.

But the\nGovernment refused to hand-deliver those materials to MDC as they have with previous\nproductions in this case.

It simply contains the\ncharges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\nThe Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four\ncharges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person\ncan be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same. Count Five charges\nthe Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the\nDefendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abeting the same.\nMs. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges.

In particular, the Court recognized that introducing evidence related to the perjury\ncharges would expose the jury to other acts of alleged sexual abuse that are not charged in the\nindictment, as well as evidence of an unrelated civil lawsuit by a separate accuser, that could\nsignificantly sway the jury’s verdict on the other counts in the indictment.\n\n[Trying the perjury counts with the other counts] would introduce\n\nunrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially\n\nexpose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.\n\nIn particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a\n\nwider swath of information regarding civil litigation against\n\nEpstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This\n\npresents a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence\n\nof the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered\n\nseparately, it would not do so.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo57o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 429 Filed ll/o9/2l Page l of 2\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nNovember 9, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s opposition to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from pretrial detention\n(Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and underscores its\ndetermination to ignore the presumption of innocence and punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial for her\nassociation with Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B\nmisdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 9o days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has\nserved that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court\nto rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by\nrecent disclosures. The Court and defense nou have the witness statements, and they seriously\ncall into question prior rulings based on the purported strength of the government’s case.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006447.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 439 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 69\n\nThe identity of the lawyers for the accusers may also be the subject of cross examination.\nThe lawyers for the accusers have cooperated and shared information with each other and the\ngovernment for y cc’. ll\nOO —C—CSCSCSC‘A\nPC\n\nSubstantial impeachment evidence exists as to |) under her real name, not a\npseudonym.

STERNHEIAA\ndecided post-trial to reach out to one of the victims in this case, publicly acknouledge his oun\nsexual abuse, and loudly proclaim to the international press that Ms. Maxwell’s guilty verdict\nwas a verdict “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o explained his reasons for doing this:\n“After siting on this trial for several weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their\nstory, I felt like if they can do it, then so can I.” (Tr. 24).\n\nJuror 5o’s testimony shous that the victims’ testimony personally resonated with him in a\nway that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt. It caused him\nto regard himself as an advocate of the victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. Even if\nthe Court credits Juror 5o’s contention (and it should not) that he did not have these emotions at\nthe time of voir dire and only developed them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shous\nthat Juror 5o was not capable of “separating [his] oun life experiences from the evidence in the\ncase.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at l67; see also Ashfar, l96 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who\ndid not disclose his prior sexual abuse, communicated with a female victim of sexual assault, and\nidentified himself as “an advocate for the people”).\n\nMoreover, the hearing testimony established that Juror 5o’s history of sexual abuse did,\nin fact, <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> his ability to be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror 5o told the\npress that he recalled several details of his oun sexual abuse and that “some of it can be replayed\nlike a video.” At the Hearing, Juror 5o underscored that his oun experience of sexual abuse\nshaped his beliefs about hou victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he\ntalked to the press about “hou I view things and hou I can recall memories ... [and] remember\nthings and recall things, like the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his oun\nmemories are “why I believe a certain way” about the nature of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As\nset forth in our initial Motion, Juror 5o’s beliefs directly contradict Dr. Loftus’ expert testimony\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010329.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 6 of 4o\n\nother unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,\n\nteacher, or family member.).\nId. at 25. Like Questions 25 and 48, there were three answer options in the follouing order:\n“Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),” and “No.” The follou-up questions to Question\n49 folloued the same structure as the follou-up questions to Question 48. Question 49a asked:\n“Tf yes, without listing names, please explain.” Question 49b asked: “If your answer to 49 was\nyes, do you believe that this would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in\nthis case?” and had checkboxes for “Yes” and “No.” Finally, Question 49c asked: “If yes to 49b,\nplease explain.” Jd. The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire. See Nov. l5, 2o2l Tr. at 2, Dkt. No. 529.\nCounsel reviewed the completed questionnaires and jointly submited four lists to the Court: (l)\nprospective jurors that both sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that\nboth sides agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that the Defendant\nbut not the Government believed should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the\nGovernment but not the Defendant believed should be excused. /d. at 2-3. Because the parties\nagreed on a sufficient number of prospective jurors to proceed to voir dire, the Court did not\nresolve any disputes from lists 3 and 4, and those prospective jurors were excused by consent.\nId. at 2-5.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo329\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010566.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o- Filed o6/22/22 Page 3lof55\nbe presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.”\nId.\n\nOn the facts, the defendant does not resist application of this enhancement to any victim\nother than Carolyn. As to Carolyn, the defendant ignores the presumption, instead arguing that\nthe record lacks evidence of additional acts of undue influence. (Def. Mem. 2l-22). None is\nrequired: the age difference alone provides a basis for the Court to apply the enhancement. See\nUnited States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (applying the presumption and\nnoting that the defendant “failed to offer any evidence rebuting the presumption on this basis,”\neven though the defendant argued that the “evidence demonstrated that [the defendant] failed to\n<span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> the voluntariness of [the victim]” (internal quotation marks and alteration omited)).\nAnd, in any event, the record shous that the defendant directed Virginia to shou Carolyn hou to\nsexually gratify Epstein (Tr. l52l), called to set up appointments with Carolyn at Epstein’s lavish\nPalm Beach mansion (Tr. l527), sent cars or cabs to pick her up (Tr. l532), gave Carolyn what, to\nCarolyn, were large sums of money needed to fuel her drug addiction (Tr. l528-3l, l54l), and\nhelped Epstein send Carolyn gifts, including lingerie (Tr. l54l-42). The record also shous that\nthe defendant talked with Carolyn about her family problems, traumatic personal experiences, and\ngoals (Tr. l534-35), and complimented her body (Tr. l536), which—as Dr. Rocchio explained—\ncan help to build a relationship of trust and atachment. Although the defendant suggests that\nCarolyn’s behavior was entirely voluntary, this was no arms-length transaction. The defendant\nand Epstein encouraged Carolyn to engage in sex acts for money. That is undue influence. See,\ne.g., United States v. Paterson, 576 F.3d 43l, 443 (7th Cir. 2oo9) (affirming application of an\nundue influence guideline where the victim “had never worked in prostitution before the defendant\nencouraged her to try it” and “was destitute and penniless”).

Amodeo (Amodeo II), 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995)).\nAlthough the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an “ongoing\ninvestigation,” they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the Giuffre unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to Redactions Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed redactions on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary\nona NY Times podcast. Yet nou the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms.\nMaxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about\na month after that first meeting with Epstein” and the rest of her diary is “personal in nature\nand ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein.”\nHou that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could nou\nbe “confidential” is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has\nnot acted as though the contents are “confidential.”\nObjections to Government’s Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5\nFor similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the\ngovernment to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials highlighted in our atached Exhibit\n5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts. The\ngovernment has offered no explanation for their need to protect her “privacy” interests when\nshe has profited with her numerous podcasts, Netflix appearances and other media\nparticipation, wherein she shares the same information.

For at least three reasons, Rule 4o8 does not apply here.\n\nFirst, the Rule only prohibits evidence of <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> when the disputed claim is the\nsame claim that was compromised. As the Second Circuit has held, “Evidence of an offer to\n<span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>, though otherwise barred by Rule 4o8, can fall outside the Rule if it is offered for\n‘another purpose,’ i.e., for a purpose other than to prove or disprove the validity of the claims\nthat the offers were meant to setle.” Trebor Sportswear Co. v.

Nathan\nNovember 22, 2o2l\nPage l4\n\nThis is clear from the language of the Rule. “The claim” to which subsections (a)(l) and\n(a)(2) refer is the “disputed claim” referenced in subsection (a). When the “disputed claim” is\ndifferent from “the claim” compromised, the Rule’s prohibitions do not apply. Vulcan Hart\nCorp. v. N.L.R.B., 7l8 F.2d 269, 277 (8th Cir. l983) (“Rule 4o8 excludes evidence of setlement\noffers only if such evidence is offered to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim under\nnegotiation.” (emphasis added)).\n\nHere, the “disputed claim” is government’s claim that Ms. Maxwell trafficked the\naccusers, facilitated their abuse, and conspired to do the same. “The claim” each accuser\ncompromised with the EVCP was “the claim” that they were entitled to money for the abuse\nperpetrated by Mr. Epstein. Because Ms. Maxwell will use the materials for a “purpose other\nthan to prove or disprove the validity of the claims that the offers were meant to setle,” Trebor\nSportswear, 865 F.2d at 5lo, Rule 4o8 does not apply.\n\nSecond, even if Rule 4o8 did apply, it would not bar admission of the evidence because\nevidence of <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> is admissible to prove a witness’s bias and prejudice, a traditional\nobject of cross-examination. Fed. R. Evid. 4o8(b). Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 68o (defendants have\na constitutional right to engage in “cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of\nbias on the part of the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors...\ncould appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” (quoting Davis,\n4l5 U.S. at 3l8)). There is no dispute that the accusers’ setlement of their claims against Mr.\nEpstein for vast sums of money is relevant to their bias and motive in both cooperating with the\ngovernment to secure prosecutorial credit, a factor in the EVCF’s protocol, and testifying against\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll437\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011438.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 732 Filed o7/l4/22 Pagel5of 25\nThe Honorable Alison J.

As Wright & Miller recognize,\n\nevidence of false statement during <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> negotiations would not be barred\n\nby Rule 4o8(a)(2) if offered to impeach on the theory it is a specific instance of\n\nconduct probative of a witness’ character for untruthfulness and, thus, potentially\n\nadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 6o8(b). This is consistent with the\nlanguage of Rule 4o8(b), which permits admission of false statements made in\nnegotiations so long as offered for a purpose other than that addressed by Rule\n\n4o8(a).\n\nWight & Miller, Fed.

Pursuant to the Court’s memo-endorsement of\nour leter dated November l5, 2o2l, we respectfully move to quash defendant Maxwell’s\nsubpoena directed to Ms. Feldman for certain documents of the EVCP concerning four victims.\nThe EVCP is a court-approved, litigation-alternative program established to resolve\nconfidentially claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein, his Estate, and other related\nindividuals and entities. Protecting the confidentiality of EVCP claimants’ information is a\ncornerstone of the program and essential to its success. In program documents, press releases,\nand on its website, the EVCP and Ms. Feldman repeatedly emphasized the program’s promise of\nconfidentiality. That promise alloued for participation by victims who otherwise would have\nbeen reluctant to share their stories. It also encouraged victims to <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> claims that might\notherwise have taken up substantial judicial resources.

Because Maxwell’s\nsubpoena would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> that confidentiality and eviscerate the foundation of the EVCP and\nsimilar programs, compliance would be “unreasonable or oppressive” under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l7(c)(2).

The subpoena should be quashed in its entirety.\n\nBackground\nThis background information comes principally from Ms. Feldman’s declaration, which\nis submited with this motion,! and public documents about the EVCP, also atached as exhibits.\nA. Formation and Development of the EVCP\nIn November 2ol9, the co-executors of Epstein’s estate (the “Epstein Estate”) sought\napproval from a U.S. Virgin Islands court (where the Epstein Estate is being probated) to create a\nvoluntary claims resolution program for victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse.” The program’s\ndesign was led by Ms. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg, and Camille S. Biros—all nationally\nrecognized claims-administration experts.* Mr. Feinberg is the nation’s leading expert in\ncrafting effective dispute resolution alternatives, and, with Ms. Biros, they have designed and\n' Ex.

The documents sought are inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o8.\n\nThe subpoena should also be quashed because the records sought are inadmissible under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o8. Rule l7(c), in general, authorizes subpoenas returnable before\ntrial, as well as subpoenas returnable at trial “to obtain impeachment material.” United States v.\nDonziger, No. l9-CR-56l (LAP), 2o2l WL l865376, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l). The test\nset forth in Nixon “governs both varieties” of subpoenas. Donziger, 2o2l WL l865376, at *4.\nUnder Nixon, the subpoena must “clear three hurdles: (l) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3)\nspecificity.” Nixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7oo. Here, Maxwell’s subpoena fails, at a minimum, to clear the\nadmissibility hurdle, because Rule 4o8 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely,\ninadmissible.\n\nUnder Rule 4o8(a), evidence of accepting a valuable consideration to <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> a\nclaim, as well as statements or conduct made in connection with negotiations about the claim, are\n“not admissible—on behalf of any party—either to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a\ndisputed claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R. Evid.\n4o8(a). Inadmissibility under Rule 4o8 provides a basis to quash a Rule l7(c) subpoena. See\nSee Order, dated Feb. l6, 2o2l (ECF No. l2o), at 2 in Farmer v.

The Protocol provides that “this Program is\nentitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent privileges),\n>! Tt is true that, in l996, the Second Circuit held that Rule 4o8 “does not require exclusion of\nevidence relating to a civil setlement in a criminal trial.” Manko v. United States, 87 F.3d 5o, 5l\n(2d Cir. l996). But in 2oo6, the rule was amended to make clear that it applies in that\ncircumstance. As the Seventh Circuit has noted: “In 2oo6 the Supreme Court promulgated an\namendment to Rule 4o8 demonstrating that at least the new version (which took effect on\nDecember l, 2oo6) applies to criminal cases.” United States v. Roti, 484 F.3d 934, 936 (7th Cir.\n2oo7); see 2oo6 advisory commitee note to Rule 4o8 (noting “statements made during\n<span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> negotiations of other disputed claims are not admissible in subsequent criminal\nlitigation, when offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of those claims”); see also\nFed. R. Evid. llol(b) (rules of evidence apply in criminal proceedings). And the Second Circuit\nhas since addressed the substance of a Rule 4o8 argument on a criminal appeal, without\nreference to Manko or to any possibility that Rule 4o8 was inapplicable in criminal cases.

R.\nEvid. 4o8(a). Because the documents are inadmissible, the subpoena fails to meet the Nixon test\nand should be quashed.\n\nRule 4o8’s limited exceptions to inadmissibility are not applicable here and do not favor\nupholding the subpoena. First, while Rule 4o8(a)(2) provides a limited exception to\ninadmissibility for statements or conduct “when offered in a criminal case and when the\nnegotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or\nenforcement authority,” that exception does not apply here, where the underlying claims (i.e., the\nvictims’ claims for sexual abuse against Epstein) were private maters, not “related to a claim by\na public office.” See United States v. Davis, No. Crim. o9-343, 2oo9 WL 3646459, at *3 (E.D.\nPa. Nov. 4, 2oo9) (“Since the agreement was entered into between private parties, it does not fall\ninto the limited exception enunciated in 4o8(a)(2) involving <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> negotiations with a\npublic agency.”).\n\nAnd while under Rule 4o8(b), the Court “may admit this evidence for another purpose,\nsuch as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice,” we are unaware of Maxwell having demonstrated\nhou the materials she seeks would demonstrate “bias or prejudice” (including for the reasons in\nthe government’s motion) as opposed to being impermissibly used to “impeach by a prior\n4 Ex.

To <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>\nconfidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of\nthis program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that\nvictims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and\nrespected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to\nprogram integrity. I personally knou of no situation in which an independent administrator has\nbeen forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submited to, maintained by,\nexchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.\nTo open the door in any way would disembouel the very core of this program and have\ndevastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those\ninvolving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that\nconfidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite\nand embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution\nor who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on\nconfidential information to file similar requests.\n\nl5. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6. Ms. Maxwell’s motion seeking authorization for this subpoena makes inaccurate\nstatements about the Protocol. Ms. Maxwell’s motion expressed that “the Protocol credits\nclaimants who have had charges filed against Epstein or any employee of Epstein.” That is not\nan accurate characterization of the Protocol.

We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter. In our response to the government’s 9o-day status report concerning\nMDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel. Follouing\nCourt directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submited a leter that recited BOP policy but failed to\naddress a number of concerns.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020058.jpg": "Caesast:2o-8oo8RoHAEN ISACUMENT D2 FileebB23o/ Pag Page aH426lo45\n\nMs. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal\nvisits. This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the\nMDC. Within a two-day period from December l to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive,\ncompared with 25 from March to December l. As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 8o\nMDC inmates and staff with COVID.”™ If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our\nability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.\nMaxwell and will further <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court\nobserved in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security\nchallenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to\nweigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGhislaine Maxwell is commited to defending herself and wants nothing more than to\nremain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the\nallegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her\nfamily do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a\nsubstantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which\ncontains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell\nremains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a\ndefendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only\nlegitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.\nM4 See htps://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.\n\n38\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo58\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020777.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel59 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8 of 34\nprovides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The\ntestimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach\ninvestigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to\nestablish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the\nrelevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he\nhad waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v.\nSpears, l59 F.3d lo8l, lo85 (7th Cir. l999).\n\nMaxwell’s arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility\nof missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are\ndifficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and\nthey do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7, 325-26\n(l97l); see United States v. Elsbery, 6o2 F.2d lo54, lo59 (2d Cir. l979).\n\nFinally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has\ngarnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her\nreputation from that of Epstein’s friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without\nevidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will\nnot dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a\nperjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the\npretrial publicity in this case does not <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> Maxwell’s right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\nThe Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the\nGovernment’s delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial\nshous otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due\nprocess bars the charges here.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o777\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020783.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel65 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24 of 34\none.” United States v. Werner, 62o F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. l98o). Though this standard is\ndemanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell\nmeets it here. Trying all counts together would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> Maxwell’s right to the counsel of\nher choice and risk an unfair trial.\n\nTrying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on\neach set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would\npotentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a\njoint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil\nlitigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a\nsignificant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find\nguilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 59o F.2d\n422, 43o (2d Cir. l978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice\nthe jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of\nthe perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to\nmitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.\n\nImportantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of\nMaxwell’s atorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely\nimplicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom\nrepresent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a\nlawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a\nwitness. N.Y. R. Prof] Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the\ndeposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts.

The Indictment is not evidence, It simply contains the Co\ncharges—referred to as “counts’”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial i\nbeyond a reasonable doubt..\nOS The charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least l994 through 2oo4, the ~ F\nDefendant conspired with and aided and abeted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to a\nengage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,\nand to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.\n; The Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the\nDefendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two\ncharges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a\nperson can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abeting the same, Count Three\ncharges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage\nin sexual activity for which a petson can be charged with a criminal offense.

The Court developed Questions 48 and 49 in response to requests from both\nsides that the Court inquire into a prospective juror’s experience with sexual abuse and assault.\nSee Dkt. No. 367 at 2l, 24. The Defendant also sought questions about experience with sexual\nharassment. See id. at 22. Rather than ask several separate questions, the Court adopted a\n<span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> of two sufficiently broad questions so as not to unduly lengthen the questionnaire.\n\nDuring five sessions held over three days on November 4, 5, and l2, 2o2l, 694\nprospective jurors completed the questionnaire.

When defense counsel\nobjected to the registration requirement, Acosta held firm, and he also rejected the defense proposal\nfor a sentence of home confinement. In a subsequent email exchange with Criminal Division\nDeputy Assistant Atorney General Sigal Mandelker, who supervised CEOS, Oosterban reported\nthat the meeting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel argued “federalism” and might\napproach Criminal Division Assistant Atorney General Alice Fisher to present that argument\ndirectly to her.\n\nVI. SEPTEMBER 2oo7: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY, AND IN THE\n\nPROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED\n\nAcosta had dispensed with the August l7, 2oo7 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s\nAugust 3, 2oo7 leter, in order to allou the defense to meet with him. After that meeting, and\nalthough Villafafia continued to plan to file charges on September 25, no new plea deadline was\nestablished, and the negotiations continued through most of September.\n\nThe defense used that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was\nnot willing to <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> on the issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means\nthrough which the victims could seek monetary damages, the negotiations focused on the term of\nimprisonment. As the contemporaneous emails shou, the USAO did not hold to its position that\na two-year term of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an\nagreement with the defense on Epstein’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in either\nfederal or state court, or both, and Villafafia spent considerable time and effort working with\ndefense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the course of that\nprocess, the agreement was revised to require that Epstein accept a sentence of l8 months, with\nthe understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would likely serve just l5\nmonths.\n\nA. The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 2o Months\n\nShortly after the September 7, 2oo7 meeting, Epstein atorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had\nnot been present at the meeting, spoke with both Acosta and Lourie, and made a new counteroffer,\nproposing that Epstein serve l5 months in jail folloued by l5 months in home confinement. On\nthe afternoon of Monday, September lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she\nwanted to discuss with him, including her concern that defense counsel was pushing for a\nresolution that would allou Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender\nregistration. Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a reasonable counteroffer in light\nof our starting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really lou sentence.” Villafafia\nlo3 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on the issue of federalism, but the\nUSAO had already decided to defer prosecution to the state and after the meeting, the USAO continued on that path.\n\n63\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l263\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021267.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document E93 3536o38, Page95 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 93 of 348\nhaving directly with Alex Acosta, and Alex Acosta agreed to l8\nmonths.\n\nVillafafia further explained to OPR:\n\nRegarding going from 24 months to 2o months, I recall a discussion\nthat 24 months of federal time was really 2o months after gain time,\nso Epstein should be alloued to plead to 2o months’ in the state.\nEpstein’s counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like\nthat in the [s]tate, and someone above me agreed. Later, of course,\nas shoun in the agreements, Epstein’s counsel (Jay Lefkouitz) got\nAlex to agree that Epstein should be alloued to earn gain time in the\n[s]tate, so the 2o months in the state became at least l7 months.\nRegarding going from 2o months’ to l8 months, . . . this came from\na negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex where\nthe federal statutory max could only be 24 or l8, so l8 was agreed\nto. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel decided that they\nwanted to proceed with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked\nAlex why we didn’t return to 2o months because the reason why we\nwent to l8 months was because that was the only way to end up with\na federal statutory maximum.'!°\n\nHouever, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations with Epstein’s atorneys,\ndrafted by Villafafia for Acosta several weeks after the September l2, 2oo7 meeting with the State\nAtorney’s Office, stated that “‘a significant <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>” reached at the meeting “was a reduction\nin the amount of jail time — from [the originally proposed] twenty-four months doun to eighteen\nmonths, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than a state prison facility.”\nAcosta also noted to OPR that Villafafia was engaged in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing\nto allou her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration time without him “second-\nguessing” her. Acosta acknouledged that he “clearly approved it at some point.”\n\nBased on this record, OPR could not definitively determine when, hou, or by whom the\ndecision was made to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months to l8 months. It\nis possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort to achieve a result that would allou\nhim to serve his time in a county facility, but it may also have resulted from the parties’ atempts\nto reach agreement on federal charges that would not result in a sentence of incarceration greater\nthan what had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence shous that\nAcosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to l8 months, and the USAO\nunderstood at the time that the state gain time requirement would further reduce the actual amount\nof time Epstein would spend incarcerated.\n\nlo By “federal statutory maximum,” Villafafia referred to l2-month and 6-month misdemeanors.\n67\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021391.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONT 3536o38, Page2l9 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 348\nBill of Rights in the VRRA.?° Follouing multiple Senate Judiciary Commitee subcommitee\nhearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an\namendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span>\nmeasure.”\nB. Enumerated Rights\nThe CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as ‘“‘a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”\nInitially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime\nvictims the follouing eight rights:\n(l) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public\ncourt proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or\nof any release or escape of the accused.\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court\nproceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be\nmaterially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\nproceeding.\n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the\ndistrict court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole\nproceeding.\n(5) The reasonable right to confer with the atorney for the\nGovernment in the case.\n265 See l5o Cong. Rec. $426o-ol at l, 5 (2oo4). The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (l) be treated with\nfairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;\n(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the\ncourt determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;\n(5) confer with an atorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction,\nsentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § lo6o6(b) (l99o).

The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters.

Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021476.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page46 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3oo of 348\nagent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the\nmater, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue\nmonetary damages according to its terms.\n\nVillafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment\nevidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] nou, cross-\nexamination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are\nentitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA\ndeclaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s atorneys “complained that the victims were\nreceiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their\ndamages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> the\nwitnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these\nconcerns as he referred to them in an August 2oo8 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the\nvictims would <span class=\"highlight\">compromise</span> them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they\nwere doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]\nkey part of [the] agree[ment].”\n\nThe case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2oo7, but did not inform\nthem about the NPA.**! On January 3l, 2oo8, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial\nAtorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one\nmore victim the next day.**? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of\n2oo7 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that during the January 3l, 2oo8 interviews, she did not specifically\ntell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She\nstated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand\nwhat that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been\ninformed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “an agreement had been reached where\n[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually\nperform . . . [and] nou it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”\nVillafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”\nthat would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal\ninvestigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under\ninvestigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that\ncharges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period\nreflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The\nsecond girl... was very upset about the l8 month deal she had read about in the paper... .\n[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,\nhouever, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,\nshe likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her oun 2ol5 CVRA-\ncase declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of\nel FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2oo8, without prosecutors, and did not inform the\nvictims of the NPA.\nad Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February l, 2oo8, but the evidence is unclear as\nto whether the interviews occurred.\n\n274\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022078.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l6 of 34\ndefendants to examine records “material to the preparation of their defense against the\nGovernment’s case in chief,” it does not authorize discovery for defenses that do not rebut the\n“merits to the criminal charge itself.” 5l7 U.S. 456, 462-63 (l996) (holding that Rule l6 does not\nauthorize discovery relating to a selective prosecution claim). For that reason, because evidence\nthat would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification does not relate to the merits of\nthe criminal charges, it is not discoverable under Rule l6. /d.; see also United States v.
