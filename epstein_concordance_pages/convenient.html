The\ngovernment does not oppose this request.\nAt present, counsel for Ms. Maxwell has a conflict on April l6, 2o2l in Colorado due\nto a currently-scheduled hearing that day. Additionally, other members of Ms. Maxwell’s\ndefense team have previously scheduled a review of the physical evidence the weeks of April\nl2 and l9\" in the courthouse and would prefer to complete that review prior to the\narraignment.\nCounsel appreciates that an in-person arraignment requires some logistical\narrangements which may be accommodated by the requested date. Further, the extra time will\npermit Ms. Maxwell’s family members to adjust their schedules and make travel arrangements\nto atend the court proceedings.\nMs. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court hold the arraignment on the S2\nIndictment on April 23, 2o2l, or such other date <span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span> to the Court during the week of\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2888", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of5\nallegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s ability to investigate and\ndefend this mater. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\n<span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span>. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v.

Olson v.\nAndrus, 58l F.2d l77, l82 (8th Cir. l978) (selective disclosure exhibited by the government in\nthis action is “intolerable as a mater of policy”).\n\nIt would be inefficient and a waste of judicial resources to continue to litigate this issue\npiecemeal. Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely\nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial\ndelay.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to\nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until\nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this mater, including, but not limited\nto any alleged F.R.E. 4o4(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3755", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003805.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2-2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3 of 3o\nApp.-o8o6\n2\nG4LMGIUC\n\nd (Case called)\n\nZz THE COURT: Welcome back.

First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\ncumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the\nobservations of her husband’s.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not “corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\n——————————— Ss\n———$<—— OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more <span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span>, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005110.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 336-l Filed o9/o7/2l Page 58 of 6o\nfurther discuss the claim.

Thus, if a conspiracy exists, even if it fails, it is still punishable as a crime.\nll Consequently, in a conspiracy charge there is no need to prove that the crime that was the\nl2 objective of the conspiracy was actually commited.\nl3 By contrast, the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged was actually\nl4 commited, but do not require proof of an agreement. Of course, if a defendant both participates\nl5 in a conspiracy to commit a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant may be\nl6 guilty of both the conspiracy and the substantive crime, as I will instruct you shortly.\nl7 We will turn first to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more <span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span>\nl8 to consider before the conspiracy charges. Therefore I will instruct you first on Counts Two,\nl9 Four, and Six, and then I will instruct you on Counts One, Three, and Five.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8725", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009259.jpg": "Case E2Gcc DOSER: PAE DUn OCR Rg eM ORIRAZBag Pages? of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ¥\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet\nwith the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be\nscheduled at a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span> time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting\nwith a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually <span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span> time and location,\nthough the Claimant is not obligated to atend any such meeting.\n3. Release\nBy submiting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations\nof sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the\nRelease. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the\nClaimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all\npast and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of atachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of\nsexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the\noffer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time\nprior to the execution of the Release.\nThe Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries\nmay have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related\nentities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to\nparticipate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. Houever,\nthe Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss\nallegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the\nRelease will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permited to\ndiscuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.\nBefore signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an atorney selected by the Claimant. If the\nClaimant is not represented by an atorney, the Program will provide an atorney to provide free legal\ncounseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and\nbinding nature of the Release.\nNo one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under\nthe Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding\ntax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.\n4. Payments\nUpon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator’s receipt of\nthe Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing\nlawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the\nAdministrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as\ndirected by the Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service.

After the filing of the civil lawsuit and during the week of January 25, 2oo8,\nEpstein’s criminal atorney, Jack Goldberger, Esq., contacted the undersigned to advise that he\nwished to take the deposition, in the criminal mater, of Jane Doe on February 6, 2oo8. The\nundersigned informed Mr. Goldberger that he would accept service on behalf of Jane Doe, but\nwas not available on February 6, 2oo8. Counsel agreed to use best efforts to schedule the\ndeposition at a mutually <span class=\"highlight\">convenient</span> date and time.\n\n| 4. Despite these assurances and understanding, on Friday evening, February l, 2oo8,\nEpstein’s process server served Jane Doe at her place of work for a deposition scheduled to take\nplace on February 6, 2oo8. ' See Subpeona atached as Exhibit “A” (Jane Doe’s real name has\nbeen redacted from the exhibit).\n\nai The undersigned was forced to call Mr. Goldberger on Friday evening and remind\nhim of our earlier conversation and agreement and to insist that the deposition be re-noticed.’\n\n6. After the conversation of Friday evening and with the expressed assurances that\nthe undersigned would accept service for Jane Doe, two days later on Monday morning February\n4, 2oo8, Mr. Goldberger had a process server serve Jane Doe’s mother who resides out of state in\n\nPo See Subpoena atached as Exhibit “B” (Jane Doe’s mother’s name has been\nredacted from the exhibit).\n\nce The service of process on Jane Doe’s mother was defective as an Out of State\nCommissioner was never appointed and no order was issued by this court authorizing such\nservice. Additionally, Mr. Goldberger had been told not once, but twice that the undersign would\naccept service on behalf of Jane Doe, yet despite this Epstein and/or his atorney has insisted on\n\"Mr. Goldberger unilaterally set Jane Doe’s deposition for February 6, 2oo8 despite knouing that the undersigned\npepsin sits awe to postpone the deposition.\n\n| o7/26/l7 Page 2eof 3 Public Records Request No.: l7-295\n\n— 2DOG=OGR-ooo3l557", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031626.jpg": "** BELLSOUTH ** (BST,Aooloo) Page l\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN\nAccount Number: 56l 832-4ll7 9o8 o45o\nBill Period Date: Feb 5, 2oo5\nCURRENT AMOUNT OF LESS CURRENT TOTAL\nCHARGES LAST BILL PAYMENTS ADJUSTMENTS CHARGES AMOUNT\nDUE BEFORE DUE\nFeb 27 $2l.ll $o.oo $o.oo $23.44 $44.55\nImportant Notice(s)\nLate Charge Reminder: A $2.25 Late Payment Charge may apply to an unpaid regulated balance\nand a l.5% Interest charge may apply to an unpaid unregulated balance as of Mar 5.\nNonpayment of Regulated Charges may result in discontinuance of service.
