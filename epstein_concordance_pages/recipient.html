By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool733", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001734.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 3of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 46 Filed o8/2l/2o Page5of5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 5\nrequested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously\noppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.\n\nFinally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehou necessary\nto her ability to bring issues to the atention of other courts, the Defense Leter completely fails to\nexplain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery\nmaterials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil\nCases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 5l Filed o9/o2/2o Page 3of5\ncase in other civil proceedings.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003396.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.?”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\n<span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3396", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003423.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*?° The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to recetve money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3423", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003441.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo344l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003541.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-6 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2 of 2\nCe: \"StanPotinger@aol.com\" <StanPotinger@aol.com>, \"brad@pathtojustice.com\"\n<brad@pathtojustice.com>\nSubject: Virginia Guiffre\nAmanda,\nThank you again for meeting with us today.

The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to\nthe grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely\nunnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the\napplicable protective order. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that\nsuch formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was\nshoun. Id.\nChemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated\nin connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here.

The Government Has No “Need” to Knou.\n\nThe government claims, without support, that “[t]he only way for the [g]overnment to\nvindicate” its ill-defined interests “is with notice” so that it can move to quash the subpoenas.\nThe government ignores the role of this Court in this process. All the subpoenas requested by\nMs. Maxwell are under the strict procedures authorized by the Rule. The Court is keenly\naware of the standards necessary for the issuance of a Rule l7 subpoena and needs no\nassistance from the government in performing this gatekeeping function. Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel understand the scope and limitations of Rule l7 and have not requested anything that\nwould run afoul of the Rule. The subpoena recipients are third parties who are well qualified\nto assert any objection to the subpoena requests.\n\nA similar request was made, and rejected in Ray, supra, at *7:\n\nthe Government is not entitled to be informed of the complete universe of\n\nsubpoenas requested by the defense that may relate to other victims, nou or\n\ngoing forward. In its leters and at argument, the Government urged that it had\n\nan independent obligation to protect the rights of victims and that it was best\n\nsituated to inform the Court of the relevance or lack of relevance of any\n\nsubpoena related to victim records. That obligation to protect the rights of\n\nvictims, houever, also is shared by the Court, and the Court is fully capable of\n\ndirecting the Government be informed of a subpoena and requesting the\n\nappropriate information in an appropriate case and regardless whether the\n\nvictim objects.\n\nIV. The Government is Not Entitled to Advance Notice of Material Produced\n\nThe government offers no authority for its request that it receive contemporaneous\ncopies of any material produced pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena. This request is remarkable\ngiven that the government has steadfastly refused to identify the names of the alleged\naccusers, the details about the alleged offense, or the statements made by the accusers.

At\nbase, it is not BSF’s burden to “to cull the good from the bad” among its communications about\nthe Defendant and to determine what would relevant at trial or at an evidentiary hearing. See\nBouman Dairy Co. v. United States, 34l U.S. 2l4, 22o (l95l).\n\nThird, the Defendant has not even atempted to demonstrate that all of the evidence she\nseeks would be admissible. Although the lack of specificity in Requests l through 5 makes it\nimpossible to meaningfully debate the admissibility of each piece of evidence she seeks, certainly\nmany of the communications requested will constitute inadmissible hearsay. This is precisely the\npurpose of Nixon’s specificity requirement—to ensure that Rule l7 subpoenas are narrouly\ntailored to obtain only relevant and admissible evidence, not to obtain discovery in the hopes that\nsomething relevant and admissible might turn up, and to allou the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> to lodge relevance and\nadmissibility objections as to the precise documents being requested. See Avenati, 2o2o WL\n5o8682, at *4 (“While the specificity requirement is intended to provide the subpoenaed party or\nother party having standing with enough knouledge about what documents are being requested so\nas to lodge any objections on relevancy or admissibility, this requirement also ensures that a Rule\nl7(c) subpoena will not be used as a fishing expedition to see what may turn up.” (internal\nquotation marks omited)).\n\nThe Defendant’s criticism of BSF for not meeting its “burden of justifying the application\nof the work product doctrine” is also due only to the Defendant’s overbroad and nonspecific\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oo7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004023.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 248 _ Filed o4/26/2l Page6eof9\nFrom: BOBBI C STERNHEIM bcsternheim@mac.com\nSubject: Ghislaine Maxwell o2879-5o9 Legal Visit o4.24.2l\nDate: April 24, 2o2l at 5:37 PM\nTo: Sophia Papapetru spapapetru@bop.gov\nCc: Leah Saffian leahsaffian@hostednet.net, Christian Everdell CEverdell@cohengresser.com, Laura Menninger\nImenninger@hmflaw.com, Jeff Pagliuca jpagliuca@hmflaw.com\nSophia-\nYour accusation is inaccurate as is the information reported to you by your staff.

OVERVIEW\nIn the follouing sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)\n\ndetails the significant events leading to, and during, the federal investigation of Epstein; the\nnegotiation and signing of the NPA; and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort to stop the\nNPA from taking effect. OPR also describes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled\nguilty in state court, as the USAO sought to hold him to the terms of the agreement. In describing\nevents, OPR relies heavily on contemporaneous documents, particularly emails. In many\ninstances, the emails not only describe meetings and identify the participants, but also set forth the\nissues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain decisions. When\nhelpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also includes the subjects’ explanations\nas provided in their writen responses to, or interviews with, OPR, or explanations provided by\nwitnesses.\n\nA timeline of key events is set forth on the follouing page.\n\nIl. MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\n6 As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl clatmed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed.\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004518.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 22l of 349\ninformation about available services for victims. Therefore, even\nthough [the Department] may not afford CVRA rights to victims if\ncharges have not been filed in their cases, the [D]epartment may\nprovide certain services to victims that may serve the same function\nas some CVRA rights.””°\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines stated that the “prosecution stage” of the case began when “charges\nare filed and continue[d] through postsentencing legal proceedings.” The “U.S. Atorney in whose\ndistrict the prosecution is pending” was responsible for making “best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified” of their rights under the CVRA.\n\nDuring the prosecution stage, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the U.S. Atorney, or a\ndesignee, to notify crime victims of case events, such as the filing of charges; the release of an\noffender; the schedule of court proceedings; the acceptance of a guilty plea or nolo contendere or\nrendering of a verdict; and any sentence imposed. The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding . . . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs U.S. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\n<span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n27o GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004545.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 248 of 349\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.””??°\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”*?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2s The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.*? The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\nl26 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8,\na2 Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4545", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 266 of 349\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters. Houever, FBI records do not reflect whether\nthe USAO’s leter was delivered to the two victims.\n\nE. August — September 2oo8: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose\n\nthe NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Leter\n\nOn August l, 2oo8, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to\nthe NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”\nOn August 2l, 2oo8, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of\nthe NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce\nthe NPA to other identified victims upon request:\n\n(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as\nvictims of Epstein and/or any atorney(s) for those individuals\nrequest the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall\nproduce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals\nalso agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any\nthird party absent further court order, follouing notice to and an\nopportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”\n\nIn September 2oo8, the USAO sent a revised notification leter to victims, and atorneys\nfor represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not\ncontest liability in victim civil suits brought under l8 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September leter\nappeared to address concerns raised by Epstein atorney Lefkouitz that the government’s earlier\nnotification leter referenced language concerning l8 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had\nproposed in Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter to Epstein atorney Sanchez, but that the defense\nhad not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was\nare Pursuant to paragraph l3 of the NPA, Villafafia made Epstein’s atorneys aware of the petitioners’ request\nfor the NPA.\na8 Doe, Order to Compel Production and Protective Order at l-2 (Aug. 2l, 2oo8).\nes The USAO also sent a notification leter to additional victims who had not received a notification leter in\nJuly.\n\n37 This issue is discussed more fully in Chapter Two.\n239\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4563", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004930.jpg": ": Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 7 of 27\n\n: To Be Filed Under Seal\nOrder.

(Dkt. No. 325). After reviewing the Court’s August l3 Opinion and Order, the\nGovernment agrees with the defense that no redactions are necessary to that document and\naccordingly has no objection to the public filing of that document in its entirety.\nAfter reviewing the underlying motion papers, the Government respectfully submits that\nportions of those papers should be redacted. With respect to Ms. Maxwell’s Second Ex Parte and\nIn Camera Motion for an Order Authorizing a Subpoena Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. l7(c)(3) (the\n‘“Motion”), the Government respectfully submits that limited redactions are appropriate to protect\nthe privacy interests of victims who have not identified themselves on the record in this case and\nthe privacy interests of third parties referenced in the Motion. With respect to Exhibit l to the\nMotion, the Government respectfully submits that the journal entries and photographs contained\nin Exhibits A, B, and C to Exhibit l should be redacted in their entirety to protect the privacy\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o27", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005035.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 334 Filed o8/l3/2l Page6oflo\n\nB. Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2\n\nThe proposed subpoena to Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2 contains four requests. The first seeks\nany contingent fee and engagement agreements between Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2 and any\natorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch\nDNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and\ntelephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the\nsame reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of relevance is impeachment, which\nplaces them outside the proper scope of Rule l7(c).\n\nThe second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,\nMaxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”\nclaims that Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory\nassertion regarding Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2, houever, Maxwell does not make any effort to\nidentify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any\ninformation derived from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At\nmost, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-\n2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope\nof Rule l7(c).\n\nThe third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2\nshoued or produced to Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-3, fails for two reasons. The first is relevance; as\nabove, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare\nto rebut any testimony that Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2 might make at trial (or any evidence\nintroduced through Subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena\n<span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005662.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page lo of l2\nLisa Marie Rocchio, Ph.D. 9\nAssociation for Women in Psychology\n2oll, l992 - 2ooo Program Review Commitee Member\nl996 - 2ooo Student Research Prize Review Commitee Member\nl999 Conference Planning Commitee Member\nl99l - l995 Co-Coordinator, RI Chapter\nl992 - l995 Student Caucus Coordinator\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of RI\n2o2o - present Grant <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> for Behavioral Health Provider Quality Support\nGrant Pilot Program\n2ol5 - present Quality Measures Workgroup Member\nCoalition of Mental Health Providers in RI\n2oo4 — present Founding Commitee Member\nHealthsource RI\n2ol4 — 2ol5 Expert Advisory Panel, Member\nNew England Psychological Association\nl995 Program Review Commitee, Member\nRhode Island Primary Care Physicians Corporation Behavioral Health Network\n2ol4 — present Vision Commitee Member\n2ol3 — present Communications Commitee Member\nRhode Island Psychological Association\n2o2o — present Social Justice Commitee Member\n2ol6 — present APA Council Representative\n2ol3 — present Healthcare Task Force/Commitee Member\n2oll — present Legislative Affairs Commitee Member\nl996 - present Ethics Commitee Member\n2ol5 - 2ol6 Secretary\n2olo — 2ol4 Colleague Assistance Task Force/Commitee Member\n2ol4 - 2ol5 Past-President\n2ol2 — 2ol4 President\n2oll — 2ol2 President-Elect\n2oo6 - 2oo8 Ethics Commitee Chair\nRhode Island and Southeastern Massachusets Trauma Study Group\n2olo — 2ol6 Co-founder and member\n35o2-oo6\nPage 9 of ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5662", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-disclosure, and Partial Disclosure,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\ndisclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed disclosure of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro.

Alison J. Nathan\nMarch 9, 2o2l\nPage 2\nfor a criminal prosecution against them.\nIn circumstances such as these, “it is most important ‘to have a measure of accountability and\nfor the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at ll9\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo (Amodeo II), 7l F.3d lo44, lo48 (2d Cir. l995)).\nAlthough the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an “ongoing\ninvestigation,” they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the\nsame materials they obtained via their ex parte and in camera procedure are being released to\nthe public under the Giuffre unsealing process, without objection from the government. The\nname of the subpoena <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and\nMagistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot\nalone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to\ndemonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly\ntailored to serve that interest.” United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2oo8) (quoting\nPress-Enterprise IT, 478 U.S. at l3-l4).\nMs. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case\nto determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge\nMcMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have nou become\n“Judicial documents” by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers,\nhouever, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those\nmaterials.\nObjections to Redactions Proposed on Pages l87-l88\nMs. Maxwell also objects to the government’s proposed redactions on pages l87-l88. The\nlanguage at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed\nsupports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary\nona NY Times podcast. Yet nou the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms.\nMaxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about\na month after that first meeting with Epstein” and the rest of her diary is “personal in nature\nand ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein.”\nHou that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could nou\nbe “confidential” is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has\nnot acted as though the contents are “confidential.”\nObjections to Government’s Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5\nFor similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the\ngovernment to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials highlighted in our atached Exhibit\n5 are all very public pieces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts. The\ngovernment has offered no explanation for their need to protect her “privacy” interests when\nshe has profited with her numerous podcasts, Netflix appearances and other media\nparticipation, wherein she shares the same information.

And in connection with an interviewing process, would there\n6 be a difference between asking what would be an open-ended\n\n7 question where the person being questioned provides the\n\n8 information as opposed to, as we all knou, what a leading\n\n9 question is where the information may be provided and the\n\nlo <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> of the question just answers yes or no?\n\nll A.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l’’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order J l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019338.jpg": "Castas2oos8oo33D-cclm eDocdntail 42o Plead D29R Pagagebof 5\nHonorable Alison J.

Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 2\n\nIn particular, the Defense Leter seeks this Court’s authorization to use materials relating\nto applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other\njudicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit\ncompliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas’”’). Those Subpoenas were issued\nto a certain <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> (the “<span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>”) after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into\nJeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its\nstandard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued\nthe Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> advised the Government\nthat it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in\nor about February 2ol9, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to\nrequest modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas.\nIn or about April 2ol9, one court (“Court-l”’) granted the Government’s application, and permited\nthat the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further\ndissemination—to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>.* Subsequently, the second court (“Court-2”) denied the\nGovernment’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both\nCourt-l and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal,\nexcept that both have expressly permited the Government to produce those filings to the defendant\nas part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Leter nou seeks to use\nthose discovery materials in the Civil Cases.\n\nAt base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process\nof criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the\ncriminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is\nto enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of\nmaterials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an\neffort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It\nshould be denied for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides\nthat any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of\ndesignation, “[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel so/ely for purposes of the\ndefense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the\ndefense of this action.” Protective Order 4 l(a), lo(a), l4(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,\nthe defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her oun proposed protective order.\nThis was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See\nDefendant’s Proposed Protective Order 4 l(a) (Dkt. 29-l). Yet less than a month later, the\ndefendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the\n? In the Defense Leter, the defendant argues that the Government “must have given a copy of the\nsealed order” to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the\nGovernment’s statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant’s\nsuggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2ol9 and was issued for\nthe purpose of being provided to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision\nthat it could be transmited to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>\nwell over a year before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.\n\nApp.o9l\nDOJ-OGR-oool955o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019551.jpg": "OGsedl ADA SBos ATT (hdc WARE 262 F i688 /Pageageisi ab5\nHonorable Alison J.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span>, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization\nfor compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the\nCivil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that\ncourts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the\ndefendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in\nthose cases, other than to falsely accuse the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> and the Government of some sort of\nmalfeasance.°\n\nIn sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the\nrelevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court\nto permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate\na civil case.

The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019560.jpg": "Came PAB OOBBouANeht DOCOURBAT-AIL o Fd DS7o2)289 eh AGB HS\ncase in other civil proceedings.

If\nthe “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-\ncation of the Protective Order was to share infor-\nmation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-\nment’s investigative techniques, then her appeal is\nmoot because Judge Nathan has already granted her\npermission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why\nthose facts are not enough.\n\nDespite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-\ngues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-\ncess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her\nright to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As\nalready noted, though, it is a mater of public record\nthat the charges against Maxwell include allegations\nof perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29). Without relying on\nany materials she received through criminal discovery,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool964o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019659.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 94, lo/o8/2o2o, 294848l, Pagel3 of 23\ndeposition material is prematurely released, as the government so clearly desires,\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to make the Martindell argument will be compromised.’\n\nThird, Ms. Maxwell intends to move Judge Preska to stay future unsealing\npending the outcome of the criminal case. But she cannot fairly make her case to\nJudge Preska unless Judge Preska knous\nes Judge Preska and the panel\nof this Court deciding the unsealing appeal are the only relevant actors who don’t\nknou the relevant facts.\n\nThe government’s second contention—that Ms. Maxwell can already share\nthe “basic facts” with Judge Preska—misunderstands what Ms. Maxwell seeks to\nshare (under seal and not publicly) and what Judge Nathan’s order permits (not\nvery much). According to the government, Ms. Maxwell is free to share the\nidentity of “Court-l” and “Court-2” and\n\nthe fact that the Government obtained an order from Court-l\n\npermiting the <span class=\"highlight\">Recipient</span> to comply with a subpoena for materials\n\n3 Surely due process does not contemplate a scenario in which Ms. Maxwell\nis never permited to challenge\nee.

As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove\nher mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches,\ncan confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-doun and mouth searches are\nconsistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different\nlocation within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant atended VTC conferences in a separate\npart of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with\ncounsel. Recently, houever, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls so that\nthe defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to atend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby\nreducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been\nstrip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip\nsearched after any in-person visit.\n\nIn addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff\nalso conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband.\nAt night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen\nminutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the\ncell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC\ncontinues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the\ndefendant.\n\nShould the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,\nthe Government will promptly provide additional information.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nUnited States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020278.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNit Dieu itren2l9@2 lFited 547o6/249 Pagel 2af 6\nPage 3\n\nin-person atomey visits are nou available seven days per week.

In addition,\nwhen the defendant elects to atend outdoor recreation, she is searched two additional times: once\nwhen she is moved to the recreation area, and once when she returns to the day room from the\nrecreation area.

MARCH 2oo5 — MAY 2oo6: EPSTEIN IS INVESTIGATED BY THE PALM\nBEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE PALM BEACH COUNTY STATE\nATTORNEY’S OFFICE\nA. The Initial Allegations and the PBPD Investigation\nIn March 2oo5, the parents of a l4-year-old girl reported to the PBPD that a man had paid\n\ntheir daughter $3oo to give him a massage in his Palm Beach home.® The PBPD began\n\ninvestigating Epstein, identified as the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> of the massage, and two of his personal assistants,\nwho were also implicated by the complainant. The investigation soon expanded beyond the initial\nclaim, to encompass allegations that during 2oo4 and 2oo5, Epstein, through his female assistants\n\nb As previously noted, “girls” refers to females under the age of l8. Epstein’s contacts with girls and young\n\nwomen previously had come to the atention of the PBPD. In March 2oo4, a PBPD officer documented a telephone\n\ncomplaint that a l7-year-old girl had been giving Epstein topless massages at his residence for several months for\n$2oo per massage. The girl claimed that there were nude photos of other girls throughout Epstein’s home and offered\nto cooperate with a police investigation. The PBPD report relating to this complaint described the information as\n\n“unverified,” and it was not pursued.\n\nOn November 28, 2oo4, the police received and recorded information that young women had been observed\ncoming and going from Epstein’s residence. The police suspected Epstein was procuring prostitutes, but because the\nPBPD did not have evidence that the women seen entering Epstein’s home were minors, and typically did not\ninvestigate prostitution occurring in private residences, it did not open an investigation into the mater.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021394.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 35o 3536o38, Page222 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 22o of 348\ninformation about available services for victims.

The 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to “provide the victim with reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court\nproceeding .. . that involves the crime against the victim.”\n\nThe 2oo5 Guidelines specifically required federal prosecutors to “be available to consult\nwith victims about [their] major case decisions,” such as dismissals, release of the accused, plea\nnegotiations, and pretrial diversion. In particular, the 2oo5 Guidelines required the responsible\nofficial to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views\nabout, prospective plea negotiations. Nevertheless, the 2oo5 Guidelines cautioned prosecutors to\n“consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering [the\nvictim’s] views” in light of various factors such as “[w]hether the proposed plea involves\nconfidential information or conditions” and “[w]hether the victim is a possible witness in the case\nand the effect that relaying any information may have on the defendant’s right to a fair trial.”\nLastly, the 2oo5 Guidelines stated that “[a] strong presumption exists in favor of providing rather\nthan withholding assistance and services to victims and witnesses of crime.”\n\nThe “corrections stage” involved both pretrial detention of the defendant and incarceration\nfollouing a conviction. Depending on the agency having custody of the defendant, the U.S.\nAtorney or other agencies were responsible for victim notifications during this stage.\n\nIV. USAO AND FBI VICTIM/WITNESS NOTIFICATION PRACTICE AT THE TIME\n\nOF THE EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION\n\nA. USAO Training\n\nAs US. Atorney, Acosta disseminated the May 2oo5 updated Guidelines to USAO\npersonnel with a transmital memorandum dated February 27, 2oo6, stating that he expected each\n<span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> “to read and become familiar with the [2oo5] Guidelines.” Acosta noted in the\nmemorandum that the USAO had recently held an “all office training” addressing the 2oo5\nGuidelines and that new USAO atorneys who missed the training were required to view a\nvideotaped version of the training “immediately.” Acosta further noted that the USAO’s\n2lo GAO CVRA Awareness Report at 66.\n\nl94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l394", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021421.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 347 3536o38, Page249 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 247 of 348\n\n“federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into whether Epstein broke any federal\nlaws.’329\n\nNevertheless, as Epstein’s team continued to argue to higher levels of the Department that\nthere was no appropriate federal interest in prosecuting Epstein and thus no basis for the NPA, and\nwith his atorneys asserting that “the facts had goten beter for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe\nthat Epstein would likely breach the NPA.*”° In January 2oo8, Villafafia informed her supervisors\nthat the FBI “had very tight contact with the victims several months ago when we were prepared\nto [file charges], but all the shenanigans over the past few months have resulted in no contact with\nthe vast majority of the victims.” Villafafia then proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with\nall the victims so that we knou we can rely on them at trial.”°?’ Villafafia told OPR that at this\npoint, “[w]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and prepared for indictment, I did not prepare or\nsend any victim notification leters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not receive any\nvictim calls during this time.”\n\n2. The FBI Uses VNS Form Leters to Re-Establish Contact with Victims\n\nOn January lo, 2oo8, the FBI Victim Specialist mailed VNS generated victim notification\nleters to l4 victims articulating the eight CVRA rights and inviting recipients to update their\ncontact information with the FBI in order to obtain current information about the mater.°?* The\ncase agent informed Villafafia in an email that the Victim Specialist sent a “standard form [FBI]\nleter to all the remaining identified victims.” These 2oo8 leters were identical to the FBI form\nleters the Victim Specialist had sent to victims between August 28, 2oo6, and October l2, 2oo7.\nLike those previous leters, most of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,\n2oo7, the 2oo8 leters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted that “[t]his\ncan be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation.” The leters also stated:\n325 Michele Dargan, “Jeffrey Epstein Plea Hearing Moved to March,” Palm Beach Daily News “The Shiny\nSheet,” Jan. 3, 2oo8.\n326 Epstein’s atorneys used discovery proceedings in the state case to depose federal victims, and as they learned\nunflatering details or potential impeachment information concerning likely federal victims, they argued for the\nexclusion of those victims from the federal case. For example, defense atorneys questioned one victim as to whether\nthe federal prosecutors or FBI agents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. See Exhibit 9 to\nVillafafia June 2, 2ol7 Declaration: Deposition of [REDACTED], State v. Epstein, Case No. 2oo6-CF-9454, at 44,\n5o, 5l (Feb. 2o, 2oo8). One victim’s atorney told OPR that the defense atorneys tried to “smear” victims by asking\nhighly personal sexual questions about “terminations of pregnancies . . . sexual encounters . . . masturbation.”\nEpstein’s atorney used similar tactics in questioning victims who filed civil cases against their client. For example,\nthe Miami Herald reported that, “One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.” See Julie Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Cops\nWorked to Put a Serial Sex Abuser in Prison. Prosecutors Worked to Cut Him a Break,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28,\n2ol8.\nPat Villafafia also told her supervisors that she wanted the FBI to interview two specific victims.\n328 The Victim Specialist later generated an additional leter dated May 3o, 2oo8. After Epstein’s June 3o, 2oo8\nstate court pleas, she sent out substantially similar notification leters to two victims who resided outside of the United\nStates.\n\n22l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l42l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021441.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 565 3536o39, Pagell of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 265 of 348\nleter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification leter the FBI had sent to\nvictims (in 2oo6, 2oo7, and 2oo8) in that it identified each <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> as “a possible victim of a\nfederal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.\n\nThe leter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 3o, 2oo8, or\nthat the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state\nplea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated leter, the leter requested the victims’\n“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”\n\nFor each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a\nnotification leter concerning the June 3o, 2oo8 plea and the l8 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were\nto be hand delivered along with the FBI’s leters.

To ensure Epstein’s cellmate requirement was disseminated to\nMCC New York staff, on July 3o, 2ol9, at l2:3o p.m., the Staff Psychologist sent an email to over 7o MCC\nNew York staff members which read, “Inmate Epstein #763l8-o54 is being taken off Psych Observation and\nneeds to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” A review of the email recipients shoued that the email\nwas sent to, among others, the Warden, Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the SIS\nLieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Morning\nWatch Operations Lieutenant, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and CO l. The Staff Psychologist also\ncompleted a “Post-Watch Report,” which stated that the “SHU L[ieutenant] informed inmate Epstein needs\nto be housed with an appropriate cellmate.”\nThe Warden told the OIG that the Chief Psychologist had advised him that Epstein was not suicidal and was\nready to return to the SHU. According to the Warden, when he spoke with the Chief Psychologist regarding\nEpstein, she told him to assign Epstein a cellmate. He added that MCC New York would typically house an\ninmate who was previously on suicide watch with a cellmate. The Warden stated there was no BOP policy\nmandating that an inmate coming off of suicide watch have a cellmate, but they usually housed such an\ninmate with a cellmate.\nDuring their interviews with the OIG, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the SHU Lieutenant each said\nthey had verbally informed the SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement and were confident that all SHU\nstaff members knew of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. Additionally, the Captain said he visited the SHU on\nmultiple occasions and directed his staff to be alert and atentive about Epstein’s special needs.\nAccording to Associate Warden l, the Captain was in charge of correctional services, including the SHU.\nAssociate Warden l said the Captain should have told the SHU Lieutenant, and that the SHU Lieutenant\nshould have told the SHU staff about the cellmate requirement. Associate Warden l further told the OIG\nthat the SHU Lieutenant was responsible for ensuring that everything within the SHU was in compliance.\nAssociate Warden l told the OIG that the SHU staff knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and\nsaid she personally heard it being discussed on more than one occasion when she would visit the SHU while\nperforming her rounds.\nThe Captain, who supervised all of the Lieutenants and COs working in MCC New York, said that after the\ncellmate requirement was issued for Epstein, he spoke with the SHU Lieutenant and directed him to ensure\nthat Epstein had a cellmate. Similar to the Warden, the SHU Lieutenant told the OIG that while there is no\nBOP policy addressing the necessity of assigning cell mates to individuals coming off of suicide watch, it was\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23399", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023418.jpg": "ll. Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9 to Another Institution and Failure\n\nto Replace Him with Another Inmate\n\nA. Notice on August 8 of the Impending Transfer of Epstein’s Cellmate on August 9\nAs noted above, since July 3o, consistent with the Psychology Department's determination that Epstein\nneeded to have a cellmate, Epstein had been housed with Inmate 3, whom the Warden and the Federal\nBureau of Prisons (BOP) executive leadership had selected as an appropriate cellmate. At lo:33 a.m. on\nAugust 8, 2ol9, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sent an email to MCC New York personnel assigned to\nReceiving and Discharge, the area within the Correctional Services Department that is responsible for\nprocessing inmates who enter or leave the facility, with the subject “Transfer of Prisoners from NYM [MCC\nNew York] to GEO.” The body of the email identified Inmate 3 as one of the prisoners to be transferred\nand further stated, “Please schedule the transfer for Friday 8/9/l9.”\nAt 3:36 p.m. on the same day, the USMS sent a second email to a number of MCC New York personnel,\nincluding Associate Warden 2, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, the\nDay Watch Activities Lieutenant, the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, another Lieutenant, and the\nSpecial Investigative Services Lieutenant, with the subject “Prisoner Production o8-o9-2ol9.” This email\ncontained two atachments, one of which was the Prisoner Schedule Report for MCC New York for August 9,\n2ol9. The first page of this atachment reflects that Inmate 3 was scheduled to be transferred from MCC\nNew York to GEO (Queens Detention Facility) on August 9, 2ol9. This atachment also includes the acronym\n“WAB\" within the Destination/Description portion of the document, which MCC New York personnel told the\nOIG means “with all belongings.” During their OIG interviews, MCC New York staff members further\nexplained that the “WAB” notation meant that Inmate 3 was being permanently removed from MCC\nNew York on August 9, 2ol9. Notwithstanding this email, as detailed belou, several of the email recipients\nidentified above, including the Captain, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, and the Day Watch Activities\nLieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had gone to court on August 9, and they did not knou\nhe had been transferred to another facility.\n\nB. MCC New York Staff Reject Epstein Atorney's Request that Epstein be Housed\n\nWithout a Cellmate\nForensic Psychologist l told the OIG that on August 9, 2ol9, she was present during a meeting in which one\nof Epstein’s atorneys opposed Epstein having a cellmate. Forensic Psychologist l explained to the atorney\nthat because Epstein was housed in the SHU and he was a sex offender, he needed to have a cellmate.\nAdditionally, the OIG investigation revealed that on the day of Epstein’s death, a Supervisory Staff Atorney\nwith the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York, sent an email to the Warden to inform him that on\nthe previous day (August 9, 2ol9), two of Epstein’s atorneys separately contacted him. One of the atorneys\nasked for Epstein to be moved to a different, specific housing unit within MCC New York; the other atorney\nasked for Epstein to be housed without a cellmate in the SHU. The Supervisory Staff Atorney said he\ninformed the first atorney that the suggested housing unit was not available for pretrial detainees such as\n2 GEO refers to the Queens Detention Facility, a contract detention facility located in Queens, New York, that is\nmanaged by The GEO Group, Inc.\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo234l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023422.jpg": "The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they\ndid not knou Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of\nthe second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3's impending\ntransfer out of MCC New York on August 9. Rather, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day\nWatch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York\nfor a court appearance.\nThe Day Watch Activities Lieutenant did not recall Inmate 3 departing the institution with all of his\nbelongings or having any conversations with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge or anyone else regarding\nInmate 3’s departure from MCC New York. According to the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, he did not\nknou that Epstein was without a cellmate. Other senior officials, including the Warden, Associate Warden l,\nand the Captain, were also unaware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nThese officials concurred that while all SHU staff and supervisors were responsible for notifying a supervisor\nin the chain-of-command of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge\nbore primary responsibility for the notification because he was the SHU Officer in Charge and one of two\npeople who saw Inmate 3 leave the facility with all of his belongings. The Captain told the OIG that since\nEpstein was in the atorney conference room all day, no one may have even thought about it, and may have\nonly become aware when they put Epstein back in his cell after his atorney visit that evening. The Captain\nsaid as soon as the SHU staff became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate, they should have notified\nthe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have\ntaken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that\nassignment occurred. The Captain, houever, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that\nnotified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3's transfer to another facility. The Warden\nand Associate Warden l did not receive this email.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2ol9. The Warden said that in the event Epstein\nwas without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but\nthat no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred.\n2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9\nfrom approximately 2 p.m. until lo p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day\nWatch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a\nMaterial Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he\nbegan his shift, Epstein was visiting with his atorneys in the atorney conference room. The Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in\nCharge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t\nnecessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but | don’t remember him speaking to me about this. So,\nmaybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard\nhim.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his\nbelongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required\nto have a cellmate.\n55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023423.jpg": "The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he eventually learned later that evening that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after Epstein\nreturned from his atorney visit and placed a telephone call, he escorted Epstein to his cell and saw that\nInmate 3 was not there. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU\nthat evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said\nSHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that\nEpstein did not have a cellmate. OIG interviews did not identify an individual who received such a call or\nwho witnessed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge making it.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from approximately 8:45 a.m.\nuntil 4 p.m. Senior Officer Specialist 5 said when he reported for duty, Epstein was already with his\natorneys, Inmate 3 had already left the SHU, and neither inmate returned to the SHU prior to his departure.\nSenior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that he did not knou Inmate 3 had been released from MCC\nNew York and that no one told him Epstein would need a new cellmate, including the Day Watch SHU Officer\nin Charge, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, or anyone from the Psychology Department.\nCO 2 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. CO 2 said he did not\nrecall Inmate 3 departing the SHU that day, and that he was unaware that Epstein needed a new cellmate.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant at the MCC\non August 9 from approximately 2 p.m. until lo p.m. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he was\naware that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to a mass email that was sent to all of the MCC\nNew York Lieutenants. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, everyone who regularly\nworked in the SHU should have knoun that Epstein was required to have a cellmate. The Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou Inmate 3 had left MCC New York earlier that day\nand was unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate. He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to\nReceiving and Discharge as “WAB\"” and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have\nbeen notified. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his\nshift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed. The OIG’s\ninvestigation revealed, houever, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of\nthe USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC\nNew York on August 9. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have\nknoun that Epstein was without a cell mate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the\nSHU tiers during the round. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he believed that if the Evening\nWatch Acting Activities Lieutenant knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate, she would have notified him.\nBoth the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the\nOIG that they were unaware that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities\nLieutenant, who was serving in this position on August 9 from approximately 4 p.m. until lo p.m., told the\nOIG that because her ordinary position was a Senior Officer Specialist, she was not aware that Epstein was\nrequired to have a cellmate.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, who was the Operations\nLieutenant from approximately lo p.m. on August 9 until 6 a.m. on August lo, told the OIG that she did not\nknou that Epstein was required to have a cellmate, and that the Captain never spoke with her about this\nissue. The Captain confirmed that he did not specifically tell the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that\nEpstein needed a cellmate; houever, the Captain said he believed that the Morning Watch Operations\nLieutenant should have knoun of the requirement, and she was one of the recipients of the email from the\nPsychology Department on July 3o, 2ol9, that informed MCC New York staff that Epstein needed to have an\nappropriate cellmate. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant also received the August 8 USMS email\nnotifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC New York. The\nMorning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that if SHU staff knew that Epstein required a cellmate\nand did not have one, they should have informed her when she visited the SHU at approximately 4 a.m. on\nAugust lo, as part of her Lieutenant rounds.\nThe Material Handler said the SHU was not his regular post and he had not atended SHU training, but he\nhad worked in the SHU approximately lo to 2o times. According to the Material Handler, on August 9 he\nreported for a voluntary overtime shift from l2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then worked his regular 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nshift in the warehouse. At some point during the day shift, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant called and\nasked the Material Handler if he could work overtime in the SHU, and he agreed. The Material Handler said\nhe worked the 4 p.m. to l2 a.m. shift in the SHU with the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Noel.\nThe Material Handler told the OIG that he felt pressured to work the third shift, which resulted in him\nworking 24 hours straight, from l2 a.m. on August 9 through l2 a.m. on August lo. After the Evening Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge left at lo p.m., the Material Handler and Noel were the only employees working in the\nSHU from lo p.m. to l2 a.m. The Material Handler recalled that Epstein came back to the SHU from meeting\nwith his atorneys at approximately 8 p.m., which was later than the rest of the inmates, and was returned\nto his cellon L Tier. After the Material Handler and Noel gave Epstein his food, the Material Handler said\nthey left the L Tier area. The Material Handler said Epstein was alone in his cell, but he was unaware that\nEpstein needed a cellmate.\nNoel told the OIG that she worked in the SHU from approximately 4 p.m. on August 9 until 8 a.m. on\nAugust lo, which was a double shift of l6 hours. Noel said the SHU was her regular post during the time\nthat Epstein was housed within the SHU. According to Noel, inmates housed within the MCC New York SHU\nwere typically assigned cellmates, but she did not knou if they were required to have cellmates. Noel said\nEpstein was assigned a cell mate while he was housed within the SHU but said that no one spoke with her\nabout a requirement that Epstein have a cellmate. Noel said she did not knou that Inmate 3 had been\nremoved from MCC New York on August 9, and stated she was not aware that Epstein should have been\nassigned a new cellmate if Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York.\nMaterial Handler Michael Thomas told the OIG that he worked a shift in the SHU on August lo from l2 a.m.\nuntil 8 a.m. Thomas said the SHU was not his normal post, but he had worked in the SHU on numerous\nprevious occasions and was familiar with the SHU protocols and procedures. Thomas said he knew that if\nan inmate came off suicide watch or psychological observation, they should be assigned a cellmate, and he\nsaid he was aware that Epstein had previously been on suicide watch and psychological observation.\nTherefore, Thomas assumed that Epstein was required to have a cellmate but said no one had spoken with\nhim about that requirement.

Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\nNortheast Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate.

Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate.

Before leaving the SHU, the Unit\nManager said he told the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Material Handler, and Noel, who were at\nthe SHU Officers’ Station, to make sure Epstein got his l5 minutes on the telephone, but he did not instruct\nthem to monitor the telephone call.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Conduct and Document Cell Searches and Eliminate\n\nSafety Hazards in Epstein’s Cell on August 9 Leaving Epstein with Excessive Linens\nin His Cell\nThe OIG’s investigation and review determined that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU on August 9,\n2ol9, failed to conduct and document searches of Epstein’s cell in the SHU. BOP policy requires that BOP\nstaff routinely and irregularly search housing units.2° MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU staff\nconduct at least five cell searches each shift during daytime and evening hours (7:45 a.m. to l2 a.m.), in\naddition to other searches of SHU cells and common areas, and BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post\nOrders require writen documentation of cell searches. BOP policy explains that the purpose of cell\nsearches is to, among other things, maintain sanitary conditions and eliminate safety hazards. To that end,\nMCC New York General Housing Unit Post Orders provide that when an inmate is transferred out of a\nfacility, all of the inmate's linens should be taken to Receiving and Discharge.\nThe OIG reviewed MCC New York SHU TRUSCOPE entries for August 9, and identified only one cell search\nentered by MCC New York SHU staff for the entire day. During his interview with the OIG, the Day Watch\nSHU Officer in Charge stated that multiple cell searches were conducted in the MCC New York SHU on\nAugust 9; houever, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that he failed to document the cell searches\nwithin the TRUSCOPE system as required because he was too busy with other duties.

Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-knoun publisher, had been found dead\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers\nwere involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they\nwere eventually acquited. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.\n\nGhislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship\nimmediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.\n\n, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,\nand he never alloued her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical\nthings he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies —\ncontaining issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the\nprocess, take her outside of her personal concerns. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to\ncomedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her\ndepression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen\ninto a deep depression.\n\nJeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her\nget a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends\nwith his money is always with a view touard maintaining their dignity. He would never\njust give out money as it is too demeaning to the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span>. When he gives money to\npeople he does not knou, it is always anonymously so that the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> feels no need to\ngive it back. These gifts are meant to allou the <span class=\"highlight\">recipient</span> to continue the work that Jeffrey\nfinds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which\nshe subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.\n\nOver time, their relationship became intimate. Houever, as with Eva, it ended\namicably around 2ooo upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,\ni.e., the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,\nprecluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this\nday. She wrote of their relationship:\n\nMy experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,\nwith a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and\nvalues and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always\nfollou through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise.
