She shared these\nphotographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein.\nThe Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these\nphotographs.\n\nPerhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had\ndirect connections to other pouerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For\ninstance, one such pouerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nwas a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3\nwas forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate\ngeographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on\nEpstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged\ngirls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and\nrequired Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell\nfacilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby\nassisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual\npurposes.\n\nAnother person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost\nno investigative effort) is Jean Luc <span class=\"highlight\">Brunel</span>. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc\n<span class=\"highlight\">Brunel</span> many times. <span class=\"highlight\">Brunel</span> was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling\ncompanion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. <span class=\"highlight\">Brunel</span> has been a\nmodel scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.\npassports for young girls to “work” as models.

Epstein required Jane Doe #3\nto describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.\n\nThe Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it\nlisted her as a victim in the atachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation\nof Jane Doe #3’s relationship to Epstein would have revealed the fact that she had been\ntrafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the\nGovernment secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any\nFederal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As\nwith Jane Doe #l, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement\nfrom Jane Doe #3 — all in violation of her rights under the CVRA — to avoid Jane Doe #3 from\nraising pouerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein\n\n6\nGIUFFRE oo4293\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3742\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004209.jpg": "Casask 4olg -Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FitdechemMene! pdgage & afil2\nPuting aside the admissibility of this testimony, it appears that both men were involved in the\ninvestigation of Mr. Epstein and are expected to testify about their investigation.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.
