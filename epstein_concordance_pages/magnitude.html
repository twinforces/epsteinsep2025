What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l).

See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000767.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 2of5\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the <span class=\"highlight\">Magnitude</span> and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997).

Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000994.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DON 22o FilesoOAI3o2 aPage dlo26lol9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions.

In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> or scope of the defendant’s resources.” Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n? The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001812.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page l of 4\nos U.S. Department of Justice\nN44 United States Atorney\n\ni Southern District of New York\n\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the defense leter dated\nOctober 23, 2o2o in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Leter”). For all of its innuendo and\naccusations, the Defense Leter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has\nalready found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the\nCourt and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to\ncorrect the inaccuracies in the Defense Leter, to update the Court regarding the status of the\nGovernment’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).\n\nl. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations\n\nThe Defense Leter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has\n“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. l). The Government strongly\ndisagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule l6 discovery to the defense, which, to\ndate, consists of more than 35o,ooo pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery\ndoes include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as\nwell as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available\nto discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2o2o\ndiscovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a\nproduction of electronic discovery, which will consist of over l.2 million documents from devices\nseized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on\n' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule\nordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-\nelectronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and\nmore, by August 2l, 2o2o. (Order dated July l5, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s\nexpectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule l6\ndiscovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span>, houever, it is possible that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l6o Filed o2/23/2l Page 8 of 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The financial <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n* See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y.

Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a\nParis-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including\nfelony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and atempted rape of a Manhatan hotel\nhousekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA\non the accuser’s uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $l million cash, 24-\nhour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his\nFrench passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a\nresidence in Manhatan.

The\ndefendant’s history and characteristics weigh in favor of a Guidelines sentence.\n\n3. The Need to Promote Respect for the Law and to Afford Adequate Deterrence\n\nThe importance of promoting respect for the law and affording adequate deterrence further\nsupports imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range.

As the Government has emphasized throughout this case, Jeffrey Epstein\ncould not have commited these crimes without the defendant. The defendant, an adult woman,\nwas able to provide a cover of respectability to Epstein that lulled the victims and their families\ninto a false sense of security. This case sends the important message that those who would conspire\nwith sexual predators will be held responsible for their significant role in these crimes.\nAccordingly, a Guidelines sentence is necessary to afford deterrence.\n\nThe lenient sentence the defendant seeks would send the message that there is one system\nof laws for the rich and pouerful, and another set for everyone else. It would also send the message\nto victims that, even if they have the courage to report their abusers and undergo the excruciating\nexperience of testifying in court, there will be no meaningful accountability.

Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page9of27\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.\n\nl. Given the <span class=\"highlight\">Magnitude</span> and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3—7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015105.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page lo of 27\nBSF\nA. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\ndisclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of disclosure.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering disclosure of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\nDisclosure Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the disclosure of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 28 of 3l\n9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad disclosure of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”).

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly.

First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the <span class=\"highlight\">magnitude</span> or scope of the defendant’s resources.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial.
