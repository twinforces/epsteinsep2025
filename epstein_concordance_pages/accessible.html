(USAFLS)\nrom: Villafana, Ann Marie C. (USAFLS)\nnt: Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7 8:44 AM\n: ‘Jay Lefkouitz’\nubject: Draft Agreements?\nHi Jay - I was hoping there would be things for me to read this moming, but I will try to remain patient.\nI believe there are only two types of agreements that would apply to this case: (l) a plea agreement to a federal\ncharge or charges; and (2) a non-prosecution agreement (which is really a deferred prosecution agreement\nbecause the defendant agrees that if he violates the agreement, the U.S. can prosecute him).\nA plea agreement is part of the court file. It is not <span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span> on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the\nClerk’s Office to obtain a copy.\nA non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our\ncase file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute\nwithout compulsory process.\nOn the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our |\ndiscussions and the agents’ observations of EE: = We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of |\nthose facts. On a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr, Epstein’s private investigators\nfolloued MMM father, forcing him off the road. Or, if there is something more recent related to any J\na could consider that.\n@. that helps.\nA, Marie Villafatia\nAssistant U.S. Atorney\n5oo S.

Nathan\n\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\ne.g., United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 53l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (“As a general proposition,\ncourts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are\npresumptively <span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span>, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might ‘adversely affect\nlaw enforcement interests.’”) (citing United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o)); see also\nUnited States v. Park, 6l9 F. Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (holding that the need to “maintain\nthe secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain\nsentencing documents).\n\nFourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal\ndefendant should be permited to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2o2o WL l49588o, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense\ncounsel’s overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the\nGovernment obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about\nthe manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested.\n\nCertainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has\nengaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to\nsuggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to\ncircumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case.\nIn any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant’s civil adversary has access\nto is the lone April 2ol9 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil\nCases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make\nsimilar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government\nobtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently\nthey recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool735\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are <span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span> by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained <span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span>, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l38 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 26\nTragedies have been forgoten, governments replaced, wars fought. Gen Y has groun up, Gen Z\nhas finished high school and college, Gen Alpha is nou in elementary school.\n\nIn l994, Facebook, Twiter, Instagram, and Podcasts did not exist. Few people, young or\nold, communicate today in the same manner, and the record of any communications has largely\nmoved from paper files to smart phone text messages and computer files. The dissemination of\ninformation has also changed drastically as social and digital media platforms permit anyone to\npublish a story, true or false. Once published, the story remains <span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span> on the internet with\njust a few search words.\n\nThe Epstein story is not new. As carly as l996 but at least by 2oo6,” the government was\naware of allegations that Mr. Epstein solicited females for sex. FBI records reflect that Accuser-\n2? was interviewed on November l4, 2oo6 as part of an ongoing investigation by the government\ninto Epstein and others as documented in FBI case file 3l-E-MM-lo8o62-49. The 2oo6\ninterview contained some of the allegations made in the Indictment. Investigative referrals\nappear to have been made to various FBI offices located in the same cities as those alleged in the\nIndictment.\n\nIt was no secret that Ms. Maxwell was Mr. Epstein’s employee and friend in the l995-to-\n2ooo timeframe. It also was no secret that Epstein worked out a deal with the government that\n\n* According to the New York Times, in l996 Maria Farmer “contacted the New York Police\nDepartment, and said she then went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, offering to share what she\nknew about Mr. Epstein and the parade of young women being brought to Mr. Epstein’s houses.” See,\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2ol9/o8/26/us/epstein-farmer-sisters-maxwell.html. Of course, no FBI 3o2 has\nbeen produced corroborating this account.\n\n> Although the Indictment refers to them as “Minor Victims” One through Three, there has been\nno finding by any court or jury that these nou-adult women are in fact “victims.” Use of those terms thus\nviolates Ms. Maxwell’s presumption of innocence, and counsel will refer to them throughout as\n“Accusers” One through Three or “Accusers.” See, e.g., Oregon v. Sperou, 442 P.3d 58l (Or. 2ol9) (use\nof word “victim” by prosecutors and state witnesses during trial violated presumption of innocence and\nconstituted improper witness vouching).\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo25lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\n<span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span>, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file.

Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (holding that the need to “maintain\nthe secrecy of the Government’s investigation” outweighed the public’s right of access to certain\nsentencing documents).\n\nFourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal\ndefendant should be permited to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2o2o WL l49588o, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2o2o) (denying\na defendant’s motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of\npursuing claims in a civil action, even follouing the completion of trial).\n\nAbsent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion,\nmakes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work.

Nor is the\nGovernment aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—\nperhaps because few defendants atempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, l5 Cr.\no25, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. l, 2ol7) (discussing the relative lack of specific\nguidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also\nUnited States v. Morales, 8o7 F.3d 7l7, 72l (Sth Cir. 2ol5) (“[mJotions to modify protective\norders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent”), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of\nblurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant atempts here. See\nCalderon, 2ol7 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant’s application for modification of a\ncriminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOJA suit); United States\nv.

In\nparticular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant’s argument that the\nGovernment secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling\nthe defendant. That is hou grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work.

Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\ntime in state custody.\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\nof full disclosure, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'’ This morning Jay\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\neligible.\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

LercouRT, P.C.\nMs. Lanna Belohlavek :\nJune 5, 2oo6\nPage 2\nL An Aggravated Assault Conviction Might Subject the Client to Sex-Registration\n\nThere is a likely risk that a plea to aggravated assault, F.S.A. § 784.o2l(l)(b), will expose\nthe client to registration obligations under the Megan’s Law statutes, either as currently writen,\nor as likely to be amended or expanded in the future, in a number of jurisdictions, including, but\nnot limited to, ones where he lives, works, or spends time. This is true regardless of whether the\nplea expressly specifies that the felony he had the intent to commit was lewd and lascivious\nbehavior under F.S.A. § 8oo.o4 or sexual batery under F.S.A. § 794.oll.\n\nAs my client is a full time resident of the Virgin Islands, the most immediate and obvious\nunintended result of a plea to felony aggravated assault is the possible registration in his place of\nresidency. The Virgin Islands statute, l4 V.I.C. § l722 et seq., is very broad, imposing a duty to\nregister upon a “person convicted ... on or after July l, l994 of a criminal offense against a\nminor”. l4 V.I.C. § l722(a) (emphasis added). Under § l722 (c), “a person convicted ... ina\nfederal, military or foreign court shall have the same duty to register as any other person under\nthis statute.” Failure to register is a crime. l4 V.LC. § l722(d). Further, while the Virgin Islands\nregistry is currently <span class=\"highlight\">accessible</span> only to law enforcement, there are ongoing discussions about\nopening it to the public. See, Virgin Islands Daily News, May l5, 2oo6, at\nhtp://www.virginislandsdaily news.com/index.pl/article_ home?id=l7296624.\n\nUnder current law, a plea to aggravated assault will also likely subject the client to\nregistration in his secondary domicile of New York. The list of registrable offenses in New York\nunder the Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) is a long one, which continues to grou. In\nl999, eight new offenses were added to the list of registrable offenses, and again on March ll,\n2oo2, seven new offenses were added.\n\n‘ A non-exhaustive search has identified two other jurisdictions in which the client would appear to be\nsubject to registration requirements simply on the basis of a plea, in Florida, to aggravated assault - Oklahoma and\nMontana.\n\nOklahoma requires the registration of persons convicted of assault with intent to commit a felony, in\nviolation of 2l Okl. St. Ann. § 68l \"if the offense involved sexual assault.\" See, 57 Okl. St. Ann. § 582 (A).\nOklahoma law requires the registration, too, of persons convicted of an offense outside the jurisdiction which, if\ncommited in the state, would constitute a registrable offense. 57 Okl. St. Ann. § 582(B).\n\nLikewise, Montana requires registration of both sexual offenders and violent offenders. “Violent offenders\"\ninclude persons convicted of any violent offense, which is expressly defined to include \"aggravated assault\" under\nMCA 45-o5-2o2, or \"any violation of a law of another state ... reasonably equivalent\" to that crime.
