Thus, plea agreements are construed “strictly\nagainst the government.” United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d l82, l89 (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v.

Finally, “[t]he\nprosecutor's office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government.

Rather than stand behind the promises it made in the NPA, the\ngovernment tries to escape them by arguing that Ms. Maxwell has no standing to enforce them—\na position that is contradicted by the unambiguous text of the NPA as well as by clear precedent.\nThe government also tries to pretend that the NPA contains geographical and temporal\nlimitations that simply do not exist. In doing so, the government essentially turns the principles\nunderlying the interpretation and enforcement of such agreements on their head. Confronted\nwith an NPA that, in hindsight, the government wishes had been negotiated and drafted\ndifferently, the government cannot nou <span class=\"highlight\">manufacture</span> ambiguity where none exists and cannot\nnou demand that the court construe such purported ambiguity in the government’s favor, when it\nis a well-established principle that it must be construed in the defendant’s favor.\n\nHere, it is wholly unnecessary for the Court to look beyond the four corners of the NPA\nto determine that it bars Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution.

This Court should reject the government’s atempt to <span class=\"highlight\">manufacture</span> a\n“Shou Hearing”.\n\nTo read the government’s brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful\nhearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 5o: yy\neS\neS\neC\nME Phe government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\nl.

Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind\na juror’s false replies.\") (citations omited).\n\n8“ A] shou trial can be defined by the presence of two elements. The first element is\nincreased probability of the defendant’s conviction resulting from the planning and control of the\ntrial. The second element is a focus on the audience outside of the courtroom rather than on the\naccused—the extent to which the trial is designed or managed for the benefit of external\nobservers rather than for securing justice for the defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Shou\nTrials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv.

This Court should reject the government’s atempt to <span class=\"highlight\">manufacture</span> a\n“Shou Hearing”.\n\nTo read the government’s brief, one would think this Court could hold a meaningful\nhearing at which it (and not the parties) would pose two softball questions of Juror No. 5o: were\nyour false answers to Questions 25 and 48 merely inadvertent; and, even though you were a\nvictim of child sexual abuse, isn’t it true that you were a fair and impartial juror (even though\nyou have admited using your oun experience to convince lo other jurors to convict Ms.\nMaxwell)? The government implies that an affirmative to either question would end the hearing.\nNot so.\n\nl. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.\n\nFirst, the parties should be permited to question Juror No. 5o, as occurred recently in this\njudicial district.? United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o6 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (\"We therefore\ncaution district courts that, if any significant doubt as to a juror’s impartiality remains in the\nwake of objective evidence of false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should\nbe held. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true motivations behind\na juror’s false replies.\") (citations omited).\n\n8“ A] shou trial can be defined by the presence of two elements. The first element is\nincreased probability of the defendant’s conviction resulting from the planning and control of the\ntrial. The second element is a focus on the audience outside of the courtroom rather than on the\naccused—the extent to which the trial is designed or managed for the benefit of external\nobservers rather than for securing justice for the defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Shou\nTrials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv. Int’! L.J. 257, 26o (2oo7); see also\nPurvis v. Oest, 6l4 F.3d 7l3, 7l8 (7th Cir. 2olo) (“fundamentally biased process is\nnot due process”); Schacht v. Wis. Dep’t of Corr., l75 F.3d 497, 5o3 (7th Cir. l999) (“sham\nprocedures do not satisfy due process”).\n\n° E.g., United States v.
