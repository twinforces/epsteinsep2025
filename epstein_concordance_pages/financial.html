See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing combination of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000284.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page ll of l6\n\nOther than his 2oo8 guilty plea predicated on conduct substantially overlapping the same\nconduct charged here, Mr. Epstein has no criminal history. Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental disclosure prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> disclosure\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000285.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l2 of l6\nsignificantly undercuts any suggestion of current dangerousness based on any regulatory\nclassification. Moreover, as discussed above, Mr. Epstein’s strict compliance with the various\nmonitoring requirements associated with his sex-offender registration actually decrease any\ndanger that he might otherwise pose. It is also worth noting that Mr. Epstein is classified as a\ntier-one sex offender, the louest classification available, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he\nmaintains his primary residence. The defense respectfully suggests that Mr. Epstein’s Virgin\nIslands designation is more consistent with the circumstances of the actual offenses for which he\nwas convicted, and certainly more consistent with the predictive factor of whether there is a\ndanger of recidivism which the defense contends there is not.\n\nMr. Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means and past international travel do not extinguish this Court’s\ncongressional mandate to order pretrial release in every case where reasonable conditions can\nassure the appearance of the defendant as required.’ Indeed, numerous courts have rejected\ngovernment requests for detention, and instead ordered pretrial release, in cases where the\ncharged defendant was either a non-citizen (unlike Mr. Epstein) or a naturalized citizen with\nsubstantial if not weightier contacts with foreign jurisdictions, including the follouing decisions:\n\ne United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (reversing district court order of\ndetention of defendants, who were natives of Indonesia, and ordering release despite\ndefendants’ “strong motive to flee” because of serious charges and “strong” evidence of\nguilt, despite finding that defendants faced “lengthy term of incarceration” if convicted,\ndespite finding defendants possessed “ample means to finance flight,” despite finding that\ndefendants “maintained strong family ties to their native countries as well as personal and\nprofessional ties to various locations in Europe and the Middle East,” and despite finding\nthat defendants “could, with relatively litle disruption, continue to operate their highly\nlucrative business from any number of overseas locations”);\n\ne United States v. Hansen, lo8 F.

Berman\n\nUnited States District Judge\n\nJuly l2, 2ol9\n\nPage 2\nlaw, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s\nappalling sexual abuse, and uterly fails to meet its burden of rebuting the presumption that no\ncondition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000332.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 4ofl4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\n\nThe Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory\n\npresumption in favor of detention in this case for the follouing reasons, among others:\nI. Victims Seek Detention\n\nPursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be\nreasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings\ninvolving release. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has\nbeen in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with\nthe argument regarding bail.\n\nMultiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to\ninform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the\ndefendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected\nfrom the accused. l8 U.S.C. § 377l(a)(l). They have specifically conveyed to the Government\nthat they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated\nherein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.\n\nAdditionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are\nspecifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that\nincluded home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims\nof a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be\nin similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.\nThey specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement\ncould result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?\n\nIl. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing\nwhatsoever to mitigate those risks.\n\nA. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee\n\nIt might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant\nis extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently\nobtained by the Government from a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> institution (“Institution-l”), more than $5oo million.\n> The Government is aware of at least one additional atorney for a victim who has publicly stated\nthat her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any\nvictim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo332", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000333.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 5\n\nIndeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> affidavit, under penalty of\nperjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances\nmakes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary\namount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the\ndefendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are “in the United States,”\nthere is absolutely nothing in the defendant’s minimal <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> submission to verify that.\n\nIndeed, and as discussed further belou, even assuming the defendant’s assets are presently\nin the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from\ntransferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The\ndefendant is an incredibly sophisticated <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> actor with decades of experience in the industry\nand significant ties to <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer\nfunds and holdings on a moment’s to places where the Government would never find them so as\nto ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive.\n\nBut perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice /iterally all of his current\nassets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or\ntens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least\n$lo,ooo,ooo per year, according to records from Institution-l, while living in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be litle to\nstop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknoun assets abroad, and then continuing to do\nwhatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of\nextradition.*\n\nThat the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which\nhe is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the\nrisk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. l987). So too is the strength of\nthe evidence, detailed above and in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,\nalready robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is grouing stronger by the\nday. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions,\nhave identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when\nthey were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government\nhas discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young\nwomen and girls in the defendant’s Manhatan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens\nof electronic discs that contain still more such photos.*> And dozens of individuals have called the\nGovernment in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations\n* As noted in the Government’s Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly\ntravels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 2o flights in which he\ntraveled to or from a foreign country since 2ol8 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature\nfurther demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.\n2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5).\n> The Government’s review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo333", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000335.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 7 of l4\nHonorable Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l2, 2ol9\nPage 7\n2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community\n\nThe dearth of detailed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information about the defendant himself, much less his\nbrother or friend, further shous the hollouness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly\nevaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers\nto exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could\neasily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the\ndefendant’s flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other\nthan that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information\nabout Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is “Mr. Epstein’s friend,” his “close personal friend of\ndecades,” and his “close personal friend.” Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to “guarantee”\nhis appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information.\n\nMoreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for\nthis defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,\nany bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to\neven be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant’s release. The\ndefendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much\nless these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently\ninsufficient.\n\n3. The Defendant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical\n\nThe defendant’s offer to sign a so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional\nreassurance whatsoever. As an initial mater, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the\ndefendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the\nGovernment could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such\npurported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs\nsuch a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of\nthe waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the one to which he chose\nto flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. l6-MR-ll8, 2ol6 WL 742l924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y.\nDec. 23, 2ol6); United States v. Kazeem, No. l5 Cr. l72, 2ol5 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug.\n3, 2ol5); United States v. Young, Nos. l2 Cr. 5o2, l2 Cr. 645, 2ol3 WL l2l3l3oo, at *7 (D. Utah\nAug. 27, 2ol3); United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547, 2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D.\nCal.

Botero, 6o4 F. Supp. lo28, lo35 (S.D. Fla. l985). . The Department of Justice’s Office of\nInternational Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an\nanticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a\njurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty.\n\nBeyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and\nexpensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real\ndeterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would\nbe required to wait years for his return.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo335", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000337.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentli_ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page 9 of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y.\n2ol9). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in\nfacilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities.” /d. at 258 (citing Sabhnani,\n493 F.3d at 74 n.l3 (“To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force\nmay need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial ... [s}uch a conclusion would, in fact,\ndemand a defendant's detention’”)).\n\nThe Second Circuit has held it is not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”\nas “a substitute for detention,” a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United\nStates v. Banki, 369 Fed. App’x l52, l53-54 (2d Cir. 2olo). In the same decision, the Second\nCircuit noted that it was “troubled” by the possibility of “allou[ing] wealthy defendants to buy\ntheir way out by constructing a private jail.” (internal quotation marks omited)). /d.; accord, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Cilins, No. l3 Cr. 3l5 (WHP), 2ol3 WL 38o2ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July l9, 2ol3)\n(““‘it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise\nineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by\nsecurity guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully\nselected’” (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, l36 F. Supp. 2d l25, l34 (E.D.N.Y. 2ool))); Valerio, 9\nF.

See, e.g., Boustani,\n356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the\nappearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an\ninmate” and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant\n“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a\ntotal of l6o hours in a 3o-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in\nChinatoun with his private guards in tou”); see also United States v.

It is\nfrankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to\nduplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the\nrequirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehou “bear a special disadvantage.” Release\nMotion at l2 n.9.

Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or combination of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000349.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page /7oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 7\nconduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims\nidentified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of\nwhom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.\n\nEach of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further\ndescribed belou, the defendant has the means and money to do so.\n\n2. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The\ndefendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to fund any atempt\nto flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.\n\nAs the defendant acknouledged in his most recent New York State sex offender\nregistration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his oun\nprivate island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and\nStanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion\nalone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach\nestate is more than $l2 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.\nVirgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.\n\nMoreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration\ndocumentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than l5 motor vehicles, including seven\nChevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,\nand a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin\nIslands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,\ngiving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually\nanywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to\nand from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January l, 2ol8, and the\npresent, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 2o flights in which\nEpstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport\narriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks\nabroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of\nflight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2oo5). There can be\nno assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.\n\nFinally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The\ndefendant has no knoun immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends\nand associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his\nprofessional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the\ndefendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain\nin the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.\n\nNor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo349", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000354.jpg": "Date: @:: BEACH POLICE a Page: |\nTine: EE Incident Report Program:\nCase No. . . . : (Continued)\nof call in seconds, inbound or outbound calls and calls made to or\nfrom (MM phone. on QR, 2oo6, at ll:o3 am, BM made a call\nto the victim JJ which lasted 492 seconds (8 minutes and 2 seconds).\nThe victim then returned the call at ll:l6 am which lasted 6 seconds.\n| The victim then made contact with JRR—Jat ll:22 am for 877.2 seconds\n| (l4 minutes and 6 seconds).

The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6.

And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor.

While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors.

See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances.

A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000964.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAUIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP FOLO Page S°oF 26oo\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(j)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo964", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000977.jpg": "Case F-26-BOBSHAURDSeuMEeN IE Hied GPA B2o Pagerr? of 26o\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov.

Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l.

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly.

In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.

Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo995", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000996.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGUsnt BOM 22o FilecoOAI3o2 aPage di226lol9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts.

Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9.

They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all.

That defendant was released on bail conditions, strict\n2 bail conditions.\n\ni) And I mention Esposito, which is the 2ol9 case from\n\n4 Judge Marrero, that is a case in which the allegation was that\n5 the defendant was a senior ranking member of organized crime\n\n6 and had access to <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means as well.\n\n7 But all of those cases, as well as Madoff and Dreier,\n8 which I'm sure the court is familiar, with involved allegations\n9 of defendants with hundreds of millions of dollars, in all of\nlo those cases, the courts held that bail should be set subject to\nll strict conditions.

There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims. We\n2l think the number is far less than what the government asserts.\n22 But even taking that number, it's a number far louer than that\n23 in Khashoggi, far louer than that in Dreier, far louer than in\n24 many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,\n25 should be addressed by bail conditions.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooolo64", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001066.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 2o-2, o4/ol/2o2l, 3o6853o, Pagel25 of 2oo 62\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl her.

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it.

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll48", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001149.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNE n De GmMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Rage 7l Ob 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001150.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-ODFZocAdNE n Die GMeholooo Aled 425o8) 26a Ragef 8 Ob 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001151.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+ANEt DOEUMEr? loo2 Filed6R248/7thgPageb l636\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001153.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 4258/26 adedgect l Ob 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001168.jpg": "CaSede2ot er-OoF3ZocAdNt n DiteGmMeholooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rageck 6 Gb 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001169.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAdN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deageck 7l Ob 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001170.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGeck 8 Ob 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001171.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAdNt n DUEGmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26a deageck I Ob 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited).

Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F.

(distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001173.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8) 26 adeagecd l Ob 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F.

Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001190.jpg": "Ca$esb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+AN Et DOEUMEr? lo82 Filed6RA23/7thgPageblGl5\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure\nMs. Maxwell’s appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001194.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo BB GHANA DOEUMEr? lo82 Filed6R2A23/?tgPageblGl5\nmistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of geting\na divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to\nprotect in i from the terrible consequences of being associated with her.\nNevertheless, in the weeks follouing the initial bail hearing, Re\nee\nPO She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue\ndiscussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any\nreason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the\ngovernment has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell’s\nrelationship with her spousc is not a pouerful tie to this country.\n\nThe government’s assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship\nwith i ie is particularly callous\nand belied by the facts.

In fact, the government has proffered nothing that\ncalls into question the report’s detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets for\nthe last five years, which addresses one of the Court’s principal reasons for denying bail.\n\nRather than question the report itself, the government atempts to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll94", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001195.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholo2o 7A ile@ 42738) 26a deagect d Ob l5\nThe report shous nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization ls simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse Pe\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, ||\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll95", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001196.jpg": "CaSede2ot er Co F3ZocAdNt n DiteGmenolo2o Aled 42728)26 a Ragect l Gb l5\nPe Similarly, the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report does not include\na future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical\nand current assets.

Ms. Maxwell had no knouledge of fF\n\nBut the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package\nwith multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of\ntheir assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her a will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv. Maxwell aight have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation.

See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def.

She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release.

The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v.

Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001219.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a dea Geold G6 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value.

Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis.

Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def.

Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001224.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocA one n Lee Gmeh/ol o4o 2F il @ 4223o) 26a geagfeol 5 G5 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001226.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il €@ 4243o) 26a Geapeol 7l G5 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool226", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001227.jpg": "CaSade2ter WM I3ocadnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geaGeoi d G5 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\nconclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(l); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents.

(See Dkt. lo6 at l3). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest\nextradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any\nincentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries.\n\nB. Restraint and Monitoring of Assets\n\nIn denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms.\nMaxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could\nbe used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at l7-l8). To assuage any concerns that\nthose assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell\nhas taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are\nnot used to secure the bond, while still allouing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for\nher spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes.\n\nl. New Account\n\nAll assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in\nescrou for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in\nthe name of Ms. Maxwell’s spouse (“the Personal Account”)!, will be deposited in a newly\ncreated account (“the New Account”) to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to\norder of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell’s and her spouse’s\nremaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale\nl The Personal Account is identified as Account I on page 9 of the <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell’s\nRenewed Bail Application.

Ms. Maxwell’s Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues\n\nThat Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her\n\nIn addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial\nmotions nou before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.\nMs. Maxwell’s pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of\ncharges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the\nsuperseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay,\nand for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of\nthe Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious\nstatements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These\nmotions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government’s case and warrant\ngranting bail on the conditions proposed.\nIi. The Court Should Grant Bail\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act of l984, a defendant must be released on personal\nrecognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines “that such release\nwill not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of\nany other person or the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b). The enhanced bail package proposed\nby Ms. Maxwell contains <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001240.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOo33ouAUNt DibCute/ntl l6o2 lF ited 82728 /2 49 Pagel d Ob 9\nassure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n* See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a\nParis-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including\nfelony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and atempted rape of a Manhatan hotel\nhousekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA\non the accuser’s uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $l million cash, 24-\nhour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his\nFrench passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a\nresidence in Manhatan.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool246", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001250.jpg": "Caseel24o/cOooB8BoHAEN Add uMent /LOF l Fiedsas/O9F2Ag ePageBlGh9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool25o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001257.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd3souAdNit Dibcutrentl l7o2 lFiKGS3i28/2agPidgec8 66l8\n=\" On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the\nresidence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to\nescort her when authorized to leave the residence;\n= Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services;\n= Strict supervision by Pretrial Services;\n= Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and\noffering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the\nmerits of Ms. Maxwell’s exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has,\nincluding the assets of her spouse and the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> security of her family and closest\nfriends.\n\nThe Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Maters Related to Bail\n\nThe government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion\nbecause appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the\nSecond Circuit. (Dkt. l65 at 2-3). It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it\ncreated this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a\nnotice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought\nthe extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. lo9). The government should not nou be alloued to\nturn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the\ninstant motion.\n\nDivestiture of jurisdiction in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per se\nrule.

Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument.

The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive.

The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6.

And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool28o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001283.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G ANA B6cuMe?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ol65l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5.

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001321.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 4o-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page4 of 25\n\nfront of a victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being\npresent for sex acts involving a minor victim and Epstein.

A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v.

Based on the Government’s investigation to date, the\nGovernment has identified more than l5 different bank accounts held by or associated with the\ndefendant from 2ol6 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those\naccounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $2o\nmillion. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of\nhundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as\nrecently as 2ol9. For example, the defendant transferred $5oo,ooo from one of her accounts to\nanother in March 2ol9, and transferred more than $3oo,ooo from one of her accounts to another\nin July 2ol9. She has also reported, including as recently as 2ol9, that she holds one or more\nforeign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars.\n\nThe defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2ol6 property sale.\nIn particular, in 2ol6, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $l5\nmillion through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling\nmore than $l4 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as\nthe ouner.

In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 8 of 26\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ll) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (ll) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42q)\n(“Nothing in this section [3l42] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page 2o of 26\nsuffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

This Court should follou\nother courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebuted the\npresumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged\noffenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2o2o WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres,\nNo. 3:2o-CR-l8-J-32JBT, 2o2o WL lo42o5l, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2o2o); Conway,\n2oll WL 342l32l, at *4-5.\n\nThe Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion. '*\n\n“ The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9), cited\napprovingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 JL), 2olo WL 3o9679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) for\nthe proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering\nthe strong case of the government... .” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts\nfrom Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 2o-year old conduct as here, but\ninstead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 6o-6l. The\nevidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and\nthe defendant faced a lo-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 6l-64.

Among other\nthings, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a\nproperty that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is\nof no value as collateral.

As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw.

That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth.

For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context of a civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources.” Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n? The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001621.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page ll of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool62l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001622.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 22 Filed o7/l3/2o Page l2 of l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means.

Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review.

Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant disclosure.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001852.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 86 Filed l2/o4/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

At\nthe initial bail hearing, Judge Carter ordered both defense counsel and the government to redact\natachments to their submissions because they contained “sensitive private information with\nrespect to a whole series of individuals.” (Ud., Dkt. 2l at 25.)

[C]ourts have the pouer to insure that their\nrecords are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!\n\nSimilarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to\nprotect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,\nterrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People\nclose to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had\n\naparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.\n\nAnd several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many\nof the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not\nhave the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they\nhave to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s\nconstitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that\nthey can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.\n\nThe November 25” Leter, as submited, intentionally avoided naming these individuals\nfor this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not\nenough. This case has generated so much media atention and public opprobrium that public\nie.\n\n* Given the sensitive subject mater of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly\nidentified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her\nalleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the\ndeath of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of commiting horrible acts of violence—even\nagainst innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool856", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001863.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 9o Filed l2/o7/2o Page 2 of 4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Does the government think that there is income? Is\n\nl8 there some uncertainty as to whether that is investment income\nl9 as opposed to employment income or the like? What is the\n2o reason for the emphasis on that or to the extent it is an\n2l indication that the government finds that implausible?\n22 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.\n23 Separate from the mater of employment, it is very\n24 unclear whether the defendant is receiving proceeds from trust\n25 accounts or an inheritance or means of other kinds.

It is difficult to believe that that was a forthcoming\nl8 answer because it is implausible on its face and very\n\nl9 confusing, but the government has continued to investigate the\n2o circumstances surrounding the purchase of that New Hampshire\n2l property.\n22 This morning, your Honor, I spoke with an F.B.I. agent\n23 who recently interviewed a real estate agent involved in that\n24 transaction in New Hampshire.

And both her net worth and liquid assets\n2o are listed as ranging from $lo million and above.\n2l Second, as we noted in our reply, the defendant is the\n22 grantor of a trust account in the same SWIFT bank with assets\n23 of more than $4 million as of last month. Bank documents\n24 reflect that the trust has three trustees, one of whom has the\n25 authority to act independently.

She identifies no stable residence where she could\n22 reside. Instead, she proposes, among other proposals, that she\n23 stay at a luxury hotel in Manhatan, the most transient type of\n24 residence.

They teach that that is something\n2o the court can and should address in the bail conditions. They\n2l teach that they may require stricter bail conditions. They\n22 don't teach that that means there should be no bail at all.

That defendant was released on bail conditions, strict\n2 bail conditions.\n\ni) And I mention Esposito, which is the 2ol9 case from\n\n4 Judge Marrero, that is a case in which the allegation was that\n5 the defendant was a senior ranking member of organized crime\n\n6 and had access to <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means as well.\n\n7 But all of those cases, as well as Madoff and Dreier,\n8 which I'm sure the court is familiar, with involved allegations\n9 of defendants with hundreds of millions of dollars, in all of\nlo those cases, the courts held that bail should be set subject to\nll strict conditions.

The government claims our client cleared $l4 million\n\nl6 from that in 2ol6 and apparently has it all today, which would\nl7 probably make it the first New York real estate transaction to\nl8 that effect. There has been liabilities. There has been\n\nl9 expenses. Our client has been through extensive, substantial\n2o litigation all over this country denying these claims. We\n2l think the number is far less than what the government asserts.\n22 But even taking that number, it's a number far louer than that\n23 in Khashoggi, far louer than that in Dreier, far louer than in\n24 many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,\n25 should be addressed by bail conditions.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool937", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001939.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 62 of 9l 62\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl her.

That is the (g)(l) and (g) (2) factors,\n2o the nature and circumstances of the case, and the weight of the\nal evidence.\n22 Here, I think we -- if you bear with me a moment, your\n23 Honor, here, one thing to keep in mind is an observation\n24 Judge Raggi made in the Sabhnani case, at page 77, where she\n25 said, \"The more effectively a court can physically restrain the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool939", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 93 Filed l2/lo/2o Page 66 of 9l 66\nk7e2MaxC kjc\n\nl MR.

In other words, her federal indictment may\n\ni) well change her earlier decisions and, given the defendant's\n\n4 resources, the court concludes that Ms. Maxwell poses a\n\n5 substantial actual risk of flight.\n\n6 Having made this determination, the court next turns\n\n7 to whether the government has met its burden to shou by a\n\n8 preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions\n9 could reasonably assure the defendant's presence.

The extent of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\n\nl9 resources is demonstrated by some of the transactions and bank\n2o accounts discussed in the government's submission and here\n2l today, and Ms. Maxwell has apparently failed to submit a full\n22 accounting or even a close to full accounting of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\n23 situation.

After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,\n\nlo changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have\nll made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense\n\nl2 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government\nl3 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press\n\nl4 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nl5 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does\n\nl6 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent\n\nl7 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade\n\nl8 detection, even in the face of what the defense has\n\nl9 acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.\n2o Because of these concerns, even a bail package with\n2l electronic monitoring and home security guards would be\n22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply\n23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have\n24 observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not\n25 prevent flight.

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court.

Ms. Maxwell Should Be Granted Bail Under the Proposed Strict Bail Conditions\nA. Ms. Maxwell Has Deep Family Ties to the United States and Numerous\nSureties to Support Her Bond\n\nAtached to this submission are leters from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse and from\nnumerous close family members and friends, many of whom have agreed to serve as sureties\nto support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application. (See Exs. A-N, W-X).

Ms. Maxwell is Devoted to Her Spouse TT and Would\nNever Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Country\n\nThe leter submited by Ms. Maxwell’s spouse pouerfully demonstrates that Ms.\nMaxwell has deep roots in the United States and is not a flight risk. The leter describes Ms.\nMaxwell’s domestic life with her spouse Sie in the\nfour years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a “wonderful and loving\nperson,” wh i does not remotely resemble\nthe person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A § 4). Contrary to the government’s assertion\nthat Ms. Maxwell lived a rootless, “transient” lifestyle (Dkt. 4 at 9), Ms. Maxwell lived a\nquiet family life with her spouse Pe until\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart.\n\nThe person described in the criminal charges is not the person we knou.

As the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report discussed later in this\nsubmission makes clear, $22.5 million represents all of the current assets of Ms. Maxwell\nand her spouse.

To shou the depth of their support and their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will abide\nby her bail conditions and remain in this country, the sureties have agreed to sign separate\nbonds for Ms. Maxwell in amounts that are significant and meaningful to them, and each\nwould cause severe <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> hardship if she were to violate her bail conditions.\n\nFor example, one surety, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post the only\nproperty she ouns. This property is worth approximately $l.5 million and is her “only nest-\negg for retirement.” (Ex. C).

This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by ae. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> fraud\ninvestigations.

The report also explains that the\ntransfers of funds between various accounts in the past few years, which the government\nhighlighted in their initial bail submission (Dkt. 22 at ll-l2), reflected movements between\nbanks triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new\nrelationship, as well movements of cash maturing on deposit and other <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ninvestments.

The Macalvins report lifts this cloud of unjustified intrigue and\nprovides a straightforward answer: Ms. Maxwell and her spouse currently have assets worth\napproximately $22.5 million.® Accordingly, the proposed bond amount of $22.5 million\nrepresents all of the couple’s current assets.\n\nThe report further shous that Ms. Maxwell has no undisclosed wealth and is not\nhiding assets overseas.

The facts\nstrongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms. Maxwell—who was\nnot named in the Epstein indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in\ntheir custody. The lack of corroboration in the discovery confirms that the case against Ms.\nMaxwell was an afterthought and was reverse engineered based on allegations of 25-year-\nold conduct from a small number of alleged victims.\n\nThus, notwithstanding the statement in the government's bail submission, we have\nbeen provided with no meaningful documentary corroboration in this case. It appears that\nthe evidence in this case boils doun to witness testimony about events that allegedly took\nplace over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration only\nreinforces Ms. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and strengthens her\nlong-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear her name in court.

In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> disclosure materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities.

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002167.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 6 of 36\n\nOn July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.\nFollouing extensive briefing, on July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing. In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 7 of 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002169.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 8 of 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 9 of 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 26 of 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 27 of 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 28 of 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002190.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 29 of 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773 (JG), 2ooo WL ll34364, at *l\n(E.D.N.Y.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3o of 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l9l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 3l of 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F.

Bodmer, No. o3 Cr. 947 (SAS),\n2oo4 WL l6979o, at *l, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2oo4) (seting conditions of bail where defendant\narrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the\nGovernment—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources—had “failed to meet its burden”). And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD.

(Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys.

On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate hi\nPo and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002215.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page 9 of l5\nmistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of geting\na divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to\nprotect tm | from the terrible consequences of being associated with her.\nNevertheless, in the weeks follouing the initial bail hearing, Po\nee\nPO She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue\ndiscussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any\nreason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer.

Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of\n\nHer and Her Spouse’s Assets in Support of Her Bond\n\nThe government’s atempts to rebut the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> condition report are unavailing.\nSignificantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the\nvoluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that\ncalls into question the report’s detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets for\nthe last five years, which addresses one of the Court’s principal reasons for denying bail.\n\nRather than question the report itself, the government atempts to argue that Ms.\nMaxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002216.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page lo of l5\nThe report shous nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was siting in a jail cell at the time,\nwas asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best\nestimate of the assets she held in her oun name, which the government concedes she did\nwith remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> statements.”\n\nThe government’s arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will\nview at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the\ngovernment asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”\nand characterizes her transfers to a trust as “funneling” assets to her spouse to “hide her true\nwealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly\nsophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully\ndisclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets\ndisclosed in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, whether they are ouned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are\nincluded in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees.\n\nThe government further argues that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> condition report shous that Ms.\nMaxwell has access to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she could use to flee\nthe country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That\ncharacterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, Ms. Maxwell\nhas procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property.\nSecond, the $4 million controlled by her spouse PO\ncould only be liquidated with considerable difficulty.\n\nThe government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future\ncontingent assets and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For example, a\n° Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002217.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page ll of l5\nee Similarly, the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report does not include\na future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical\nand current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse\na and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the\nreference o i is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knouledge of _\n\nBut the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package\nwith multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of\ntheir assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It\nis a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nconsequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The\nproposed bail package does exactly that.°\n\nc. The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and\n\nTherefore a Flight Risk Is Specious\n\nThe government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an\n\nexpertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.\n° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the\nmajority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (/d. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with,\nall of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her — | will be\nleft with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ninformation because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9). The\ndefense provided the spouse’s current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank.\n\n7\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo22l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo3 Filed l2/23/2o Page l4 of l5\n\nFinally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country\nother than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible\nstandard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.®\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France\nof Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,\nFrance Details Modeling Agent in Jeffrey Epstein Inquiry, htps://www.theguardian.com/world/2o2o/dec/l 7/france-\ndetains-modelling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-in-jeffrey-epstein-inquiry.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo222o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2 of 22\ncombination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo—l4; a detailed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25-29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34—\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2238", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 8 of 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895 F.2d 8lo (lst Cir. l99o). That\nburden is “limited.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “[a] judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo224o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002242.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page lo of 22\nweight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness\ntestimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, 4 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4—83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3-83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2242", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def.

Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2245", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l5 of 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> figures] are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def.

O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2247", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l7 of 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86-87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2249", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002250.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l8 of 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\nconclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def.

Using a time-\nhonored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the\nlawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was biter,\nhard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document\nproductions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including\ndepositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties.

(Because the case setled before trial, that sole\nexception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)\n\nNotably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective\nOrder, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against\nMaxwell.

Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3l42(e),\nthe Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if\nreleased, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this\npropensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo275l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 8 of 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2755", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 3 of l2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt.

Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited).

Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg.

Mot. at 7.\nThose motions became fully briefed one week ago and are nou pending before this Court. The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial\nand personal connections abroad, substantial <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, and experience evading\ndetection. /d. at lo-ll. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2773", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page lo of l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2777", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002783.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl7l Filed o3/23/2l Page3ofl8\n=\" On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the\nresidence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to\nescort her when authorized to leave the residence;\n= Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services;\n= Strict supervision by Pretrial Services;\n= Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and\noffering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the\nmerits of Ms. Maxwell’s exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has,\nincluding the assets of her spouse and the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> security of her family and closest\nfriends.\n\nThe Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Maters Related to Bail\n\nThe government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion\nbecause appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the\nSecond Circuit.

It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it\ncreated this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a\nnotice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought\nthe extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. lo9). The government should not nou be alloued to\nturn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the\ninstant motion.\n\nDivestiture of jurisdiction in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per se\nrule. Rather, it is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy that is\ndesigned to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two\ncourts at the same time.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S.

He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature.

As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse.

Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2787", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002895.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl95 Filed o4/o5/2l Page6ofll\nPage 6\n\ncase or motivation to move to quash an otherwise improper subpoena.” Accordingly, the\nGovernment respectfully requests notice of all subpoenas with pretrial return dates issued or sought\nto be issued under Rule l7(c).°\n\nWhile, as the Court noted in its Order, Rule l7(c) subpoenas are frequently issued ex parte\nin this district, the issue is rarely litigated.

Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation.

His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims.

Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003224.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section III.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3224", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003300.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafana of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo33oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003327.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.E.R. Provisions Relating to <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3327", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3344", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3357", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003361.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR- oooo336l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of’ Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\na When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\n\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo337l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>—have gone\nunatended.”*® Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””*” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses.

Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter . . . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34l7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein. In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003488.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual\nrelations with Dershouitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but\nalso on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to\nbeing a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshouitz was an eye-witness\nto the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators.\nDershouitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.\nIndeed, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal\nprosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co-\nconspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5. Thus, Dershouitz helped negotiate an agreement with a\nprovision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for\nsexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if\ndisclosed, Dershouitz (along with other members of Epstein’s defense team) and the\nGovernment tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims and the\ngeneral public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in\nEpstein’s sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity\ngranted by the NPA for the crimes she commited in Florida. In addition to participating in the\nsexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures\n\n4\nGIUFFRE oo429l\nCONFIDENTIAL\nDOJ-OGR-oooo374o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003855.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page3of8\nThe Hon.

The government’s modus operandi\ncan be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”\n\nConsistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and\nmethodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third\nparties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary\njournal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention\nMs. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any\ncontemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is pouerful evidence of innocence.\nImportantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other\ncontemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,\nabsence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the\ngovernment’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical\nevidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.\n\nAlthough all the alleged victims in this mater have monetized their claims against\nEpstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their oun self-interest in monetary\noutcomes. Again, this is pouerful evidence of innocence.\n\nThe government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has\nabandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use\nthe subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a\nfair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule l7\nsubpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 49 of 349\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “‘we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.*+ Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n22 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n3 Chapter One, Section IIIB of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to... change anything.”\n\nam Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nU.S. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004422.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l25 of 349\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !™4\n\nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafana of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.” !*°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl55 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4422", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004449.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l52 of 349\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\n\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM §§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4449", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004466.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l69 of 349\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\n\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\nau Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4466", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004479.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l82 of 349\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4479", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004483.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l86 of 349\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7*? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”**\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n282, Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4483", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004493.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l96 of 349\ninvestigation.7* Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,’ or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nia See, e.g., Julie K.

This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal\nauthorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation,\nas well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions. OPR discusses key events relating to the USAO’s and\nthe FBI’s interactions with victims before and after the signing of the NPA, beginning with the\nFBI’s initial contact with victims through leters informing them that the FBI had initiated an\ninvestigation. A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nIl. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA. History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”**? The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n26o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem. Rest assured that we will continue to treat this mater as we\nwould any similarly situated case.°°\nIn a November 5, 2oo7 leter, Sloman complained to Lefkouitz that private investigators\nworking for Epstein had been contacting victims and asking whether government agents had\ndiscussed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> setlement with them. Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?’”>\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o2 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\nao8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o9 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4535", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004539.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 242 of 349\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?!’ Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter .. . and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\n2l8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4539", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o3 of 349\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement[,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.*° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she “was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.*** In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing. Edwards himself was out of toun and not able to\nte As previously noted, the defense used Florida criminal procedure to depose potential federal victims to learn\ninformation concerning the federal investigation even though those individuals were not involved in the state\nprosecution. For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46oo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004610.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3l3 of 349\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

As in Cosby, the government is trying\nto renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same\noffenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA.

During this conversation,\nCosby offered to continue assisting Constand if she still desired to work in sports\nbroadcasting. He also indicated that he would pay for Constand to continue her\neducation.

As with the\nprevious call, Cosby again refused to identify the pills that he had provided to Constand\non the night of the alleged assault.\n\nWithin days of filing the police report, Constand received two telephone messages\nfrom people associated with Cosby.

Constand called the representative back and\nrecorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her\nmother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them.

Constand never returned the atorney’s call.\n\nIn the meantime, the Durham Regional Police Department referred Constand’s\npolice report to the Philadelphia Police Department, which, in turn, referred it to the\nCheltenham Police Department in Montgomery County, where Cosby’s residence was\nlocated.

Castor, Constand’s behavior in the year since the\nalleged assault complicated any effort to secure a conviction against Cosby. As\nevidenced by the number of telephone calls that she recorded, Constand continued to\ntalk with Cosby on the phone, and she also continued to meet with him in person after\nthe incident. D.A.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l85", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 7 of l4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

U/d. at 82). Second, the Court\ndetermined that “[t]he government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong”\nbased on the “multiple victims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in\nserious crimes,” as well as corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence.” (/d.). Third, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics\ndemonstrate that she poses a risk of flight. (/d. at 83). In addressing that third factor, the Court\nemphasized the defendant’s “substantial international ties,” which “could facilitate living abroad,”\nincluding “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least\none foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). The Court noted that Maxwell “is a citizen of\nFrance, a nation that does not appear to extradite its citizens,” and found that Maxwell “possesses\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” yet “the representations made to Pretrial Services regarding the\ndefendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid picture of the resources\navailable.” (Ud. at 83-84).\n\nAccordingly, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of demonstrating\nthat the defendant “‘poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even the most restrictive\nconditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure her appearance. (/d. at 86). The Court found\nthat although Maxwell “apparently failed to submit a full accounting or even a close to full\naccounting of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” “[e]ven if the picture of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources were not\nopaque, as it is, detention would still be appropriate.” (/d. at 86-87). That conclusion was informed\nby the defendant’s “significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources” and “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (/d. at 87). The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent\nconduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the\ndefense has acknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). The Court\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006203.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page3ofll\nPage 3\nconcluded that electronic monitoring and private security guards “would be insufficient” because\nthe defendant could remove the monitor and evade private guards. (/d. at 87-88).\n\nFinally, the Court rejected the defendant’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the\ndifficulty of preparing a defense with an incarcerated client, noting that the defendant had many\nmonths to prepare for trial. (/d. at 89-9o). The Court found that measures in place were sufficient\nto ensure the defendant’s access to her counsel, but also directed the Government to work with the\ndefense “to provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and stated that the\ndefense may make specific applications to the Court for further relief if the process was\n“inadequate in any way.” (/d. at 9o-9l).\n\n2. The Court’s Second Detention Order\n\nThe defendant renewed her bail application in December 2o2o, presenting a revised bail\npackage with additional <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> restrictions. (Dkt. 97). After receiving further writen\nsubmissions (Dkt. loo, lo3), the Court denied the defendant’s application in a writen opinion\nissued on December 28, 2o2o. (Dkt. lo6 (“Second Order”)). The Court found that the arguments\npresented “either were made at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then” and the new\ninformation “only solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and\nthat no combination of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2). The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation.\n(/d. at 2). The Court rejected the defendant’s claim that the Government overstated the strength of\nits case at the bail hearing, finding that the defendant “too easily discredits the witness testimony.”\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006204.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofll\nPage 4\n(Id. at 9-lo). The Court credited the Government’s proffer that “additional evidence, including\nflight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further support the main\nwitnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct.” (/d. at lo).\n\nThe Court found that the defendant “continues to have substantial international ties and\nmultiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have familial and personal connections abroad.”\n(/d. at ll). The Court was unpersuaded by the defendant’s offer to consent to extradition, noting\nthat the “legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained\n“fundamentally unchanged.” (/d. at ll-l3). The Court further explained that the defendant’s\n“extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources also continue to provide her the means to flee the country and\nto do so undetected.” (/d. at l3).\n\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant’s “patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly” on its assessment of her history\nand characteristics. (/d. at l5). In so doing, the Court highlighted that in July 2o2o the defendant\nrepresented to Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection\nwith her renewed request for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth\nof the defendant and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2o2o. (/d.). The\nCourt found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation was the result of the\nDefendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection.” (/d. at l5-l6). The Court explained:\n\nIn sum, the evidence ofa lack of candor is, if anything, stronger nou\nthan in July 2o2o, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s\nrepresentations to Pretrial Services were woefully incomplete. That\nlack of candor raises significant concerns as to whether the Court\nhas nou been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances\nand as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo62o4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006205.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 423 Filed ll/o8/2l Page5oflil\nPage 5\n(Id. at l6). The Court again concluded that the defendant presented a risk of flight and that the\nproposed bail package “cannot reasonably assure her appearance,” as it “would leave unrestrained\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself” and the “proposed\nbond is only partially secured.” (/d. at l6-l8).\n\nFinally, the Court was “unpersuaded” by the defendant’s argument “that the conditions of\nher confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and\nthus justify release.” (/d. at 2o). The Court noted that the defendant did not “meaningfully dispute”\nthat she has received more time than other inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”)\nto review discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her lawyers.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6258", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 8ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault.

There is no psychologi-\ncal diagnosis that alone could preclude the possibility that a sexual assault\noccurred. Rather, these generate rival plausible hypotheses that need to be\nevaluated to thoroughly evaluate all the possible candidates for explaining\nthe allegation. That is, an investigation into a contested sexual assault charge\nis more complete and accurate when two overarching hypotheses are con-\nsidered: (a) This individual with psychological condition x was indeed\nsexually assaulted or (b) this individual with psychological condition x is\nmaking a false allegation due to condition x (xk can be equal to o). This is\nmore complete than considering only one of these possibilities. Of course,\nwhen no relevant psychological condition is present, the second need not be\nconsidered. In addition, where there is overwhelming evidence (witnesses)\nthat make condition (b) obviously false, then again, this condition need not\nbe evaluated. Other methodologies such as lie detection (Gruben & Madsen,\n2oo5) may be used to make assessments, but a review of these methods is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\nA person falsely convicted (or even accused) of an alleged crime will\nexperience significant psychological, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>, and social consequences.\nPrevention of both false convictions and false acquitals should be the\nutmost priority in any sexual assault case. Considering the dearth of forensic\nresearch on causal mechanisms of false allegations by claimants, it appears\nthat this work is needed to offset the bulk of forensic practice that is not\nguided by a model to understand hou false allegations may be generated.\nWe make no claim regarding the moral equivalency of a true allegation\nthat is not believed versus a false allegation that is believed. Rather, we do\nsuggest that minimizing both of these kinds of errors is a worthy goal.\n\nLEGAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nIN THE UNITED STATES\n\nIt is no surprise that merely raising the issue of false allegations may evoke\ntension and unease in some; for some, this question is not politically cor-\nrect. To be sure, historically claims of sexual assault were handled relatively\nunfairly for the victims both legally and socially. In early America, many\npeople looked upon rape perpetration as litle more than a sexual misdeed\non the level of premarital sex and as an unfortunate consequence of sexual\ndesire (Block, 2oo6). Women’s claims of sexual assault were often unfairly\ndoubted. In fact, pswedologia phantastica was the legally and scientifically\nacknouledged term used to describe a delusional state in which a woman\nfalsely believed that she had been raped (Bessmer, l984).\n\nBeginning in the l96os, a public counteraction to the prevailing treat-\nment of rape victims gained prominence, largely spurred by the feminist\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6273", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 9 of 29\nPathways to False Allegations lo3\n\nFor the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations\nas either knouingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information\nprocessing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that\na coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this\npaper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-\nlihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,\nsome psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to\nfabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be\nbelieved are the positive consequences of a false report.\n\nPATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT\nThe pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-\ntigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible\npathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been\nincluded.\n\nLying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain\nThat the alleged victim is knouingly making a false claim of sexual assault is\na pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway\nconsidered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can\nbe difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as\nthe favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences\ncould be\nl. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator\nexperiences,\n2. secondary gain from victim status,\n3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases), and\n4, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain.\n\nIn sections belou, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-\natric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with\nantisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknouledge that lying\nalso occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-\natric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,\nthe victim knouingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to\nfalse allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-\ntory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need\nto be considered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006282.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-3 Filed ll/o8/2l Page l4 of 29\nlo8 J. Engle and W. O'Donobue\nthat occurred while he or she was under the influence or while experienc-\ning the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may atempt to make\nsense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events\nthat occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize\nwhat memories are intact, a person may confabulate or fill in the memory\nlapses with events that seem probable or which for some reason they come\nto believe “must have” taken place. For example, waking up naked but not\nremembering hou his or her clothes were removed, a person may conclude\nthat someone else removed the clothes without his or her consent, even\nif the individual had, while intoxicated, actually removed his or her oun\nclothes without remembering having done so. In addition, some drugs can\nartificially affect sexual interest (e.g., ecstasy, cocaine) or modify the indi-\nvidual’s normal disinhibitions regarding sexuality that can affect the analysis\nof sexual consent. Thus, an individual may not normally have been sexually\ninterested or may typically have been more sexually inhibited and not given\nconsent. She may come to be puzzled after a sexual interaction and con-\nclude that she was sexually assaulted because her behavior did not fit with\nher expectations.\nAntisocial Personality Disorder (or Conduct Disorder\nin Adolescents)\nThe DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2ooo) explains the essen-\ntial feature of antisocial personality disorder as “a pervasive patern or\ndisregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in early child-\nhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood.” Diagnostic criteria\nconsist of the follouing:\nl. failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors as\nindicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;\n2. deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning\nothers for personal profit or pleasure;\n3. impulsivity or failure to plan ahead;\n4, irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or\nassaults;\n5. reckless disregard for safety of self or others;\n6. consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain\nconsistent work behavior or honor <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> obligations; and\n7. lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing\nhaving hurt, mistreated, or stolen from another.\nDiagnostic criteria l, 2, 4, and 7 are of particular importance in this\npathway.

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7499", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007501.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 8 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672. These flaws\nalloued him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize\npeople into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\n\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

The Government is therefore not able\nto interpose a Daubert challenge at this time.! The Court should require the defense to provide\nsupplemental expert notice forthwith or preclude these witnesses from testifying.\n\nl. APPLICABLE LAW\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(C) provides that where, as here, the\nGovernment has provided expert notice and requested reciprocal notice from the defense, the\ndefendant “must . . . give to the government a writen summary of any [expert] testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use . . . as evidence at trial.” Such summary must “describe the witness’s\nopinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed.

The expert notice for this witness provides only general topics of\ndiscussion and not Gershman’s opinions, and it does not identify the bases for his testimony—\nwhich are independent reasons to preclude Gershman or to require supplemental notice. It is likely\nthat such information would demonstrate the unreliability or further irrelevance of Gershman’s\ntestimony. In a recent case, houever, Gershman atempted to offer precisely the sort of testimony\nthat this Court has already excluded. See U.S. Securities and Exchange Comm’n v. Collector’s\nCoffee Inc., -- F.

BEFORE THE DEFENDANT’S REMAINING WITNESSES OFFER EXPERT\nTESTIMONY, THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE\nThe defense provided brief notice of four additional experts: Robert Kelso, who would\n\ntestify about computer forensics; John Lopez, who would testify about <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records; and two\n\nforensic document specialists. The defendant’s expert notice is not clear regarding these witness’s\n\nexpected testimony and the bases for that testimony.

The Government is not able to\ntake a position on the reliability or relevance of those opinions from the face of the expert notice.\nGiven the proximity to trial, any additional delay to provide sufficient notice should be closely\nscrutinized by the Court, and entirely precluded if notice is not provided forthwith.\n\nA. Robert Kelso and John Lopez\nThe defendant anticipates calling Robert Kelso, a computer forensics specialist, to testify\nabout:\nthe user data associated with certain devices seized and\nsearched by the government’s team in this case, documents\nand photographs extracted from certain of those devices, and\nthe metadata associated with certain documents and\nphotographs. He may also testify generally about computer\nforensic principles associated with the creation of documents,\nstorage and retrieval of digital documents and photographs,\nincluding the limits to the information that can be gleaned\nfrom the metadata. Mr. Kelso may testify in rebutal to any\ntestimony offered by the government through Stephen Flatley.\nAs trial preparation proceeds, the defense will update the\ntopics for Mr. Kelso if any arise.\n(Ex. A at l2-l3).\nSimilarly, the defendant anticipates John Lopez, a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> investigator, to testify about:\nhis review of certain <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records provided by the\ngovernment in discovery. Specifically, Mr. Lopez will discuss\nvarious transfers of funds that are reflected in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nrecords and explain the information contained in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nrecords regarding those transfers.\n(Id. at l3).\nTo the extent Kelso and Lopez are expected to summarize evidence otherwise in the record,\nthat testimony is not expert testimony, and therefore its admission is not precluded by Rule 7o2.\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7 Filed ll/24/2l Page 25 of 28\nSee United States v.

The Government has similarly provided expert notice in an abundance of caution for\nStephen Flatley, an FBI computer forensic examiner who will testify as a fact witness about his\nextraction of devices seized pursuant to court authorized search warrants and evidence recovered\nfrom those devices. !!\n\nTo the extent Kelso and Lopez would testify based on their “scientific, technical, or other\nspecialized knouledge,” houever, that testimony is expert testimony. /d. (quoting Fed. R. Evid.\n7o2(a)). And any such testimony is not reflected in the expert notice. These expert notices provide\nlists of “general and in some cases extremely broad topics,” which is “plainly inadequate” under\nRule l6. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at ll5. For instance, the notice for Kelso states that he will testify\n“generally about computer forensic principles associated with the creation of documents,” and\ntestify “about user data associated with certain devices seized and searched by the government’s\nteam in this case.” (Ex. A at l2). It also states that the defense may “update the topics for Mr.\nKelso” before trial. (/d. at l3 (emphasis added)). Similarly, Lopez will “discuss various transfers\nof funds that are reflected in the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records and explain the information contained in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records.” (/d.). These lists of topics do not permit the Government to identify Kelso and\nLopez’s opinions, determine whether the proffered experts are in fact expert on those subjects, and\nlitigate the reliability and relevance of those opinions.\n\n'!

Hindsight bias\nrefers to the tendency to overestimate hou predictable or foreseeable an event is after being\ninformed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knouledge of the outcome of the event, i.e.\nEpstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the\nimportance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the\npredictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to\njudgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to\noverestimate hou predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff,\nl975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the\noutcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2oo3).\nHindsight bias has been discussed in over 8oo scholarly articles across a variety of different\ndomains including medicine, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the\nlegal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2ol2; Arkes, 2ol3; Strohmaier et al., 2o2l) and using a variety\nof different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2ol6) and a variety of different stimuli such\nas writen vignetes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2oo7), and auditory stimuli (e.g.,\nBernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2ol2). Even individuals with specialized training and\nexpertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2oo7). One notable study detected\nhindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with\noutcome knouledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did\nnot receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence\n(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2ol6). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of\nmental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again,\noutcome knouledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the\npatient (Beltrani et al., 2ol8).\n\nHindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events\noccurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—\neither ignoring evidence or atributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of\nevidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias\nshould temper any claims that so called “grooming” behaviors should have been noticed and\neither reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knouledge or intent.\n\nc. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect\n\nThe term \"Halo effect\" was coined by Thorndike (l92o) a century ago. The Halo effect is\na cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic\nhas a radiating effect on hou other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated.\nFor example, one classic study found that physical atractiveness influenced evaluations of the\ntarget's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —\ndespite the fact that no information about any of these atributes was provided (Dion et al.,\n\nl972). Physical atractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with\n\natractive individuals being held less-responsible than unatractive individuals (Dion, l972;\n\nEfran, l974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than atractiveness, such\n\nas the described status of the target (Wilson, l968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid,\n\nl973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2oll). Studies have documented.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008077.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 8ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 7\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th\nEd., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2ol3), pp. 659-672.

These\nwere not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual\nbehavior should it prove relevant.\nd. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault\nAllegations\n\nStudies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the\nassertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and\nare also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are\nmultiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.\n\nNot all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been litle work on\nunderstanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample\nmost relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has\nproposed ll pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)\nfalse memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality\ndisorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (l) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,\nand (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False\nAllegations of Sexual Assault, l2 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate\nin the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The\ndescriptions of these pathways that follou include material drawn nearly verbatim from the\narticle by Engle and O’Donohue (2ol2), which was published before the latest edition of the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in\ncharacterizing certain personality disorders.\n\nLying: Lying involves the alleged victim knouingly making a false claim of sexual\nassault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of\nwhat they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these\nconsequences could be:\n\n= l. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,\n\n= 2.secondary gain from victim status,\n\n= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual\nactivity, pregnancy, sexually transmited diseases)\n\n= 4. <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain.\n\nImplied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently\ngiven is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on\ndeterminations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication.

The defense argues the NPA is relevant\n\n5 to the bias and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> interest of two witnesses. One\n\n6 anticipated witness received immunity from criminal prosecution\n7 under the NPA. Additionally, under the NPA, Epstein agreed to\n8 pay for a lawyer for an alleged victim who was anticipated to\n\n9 testify and agreed not to contest her civil suit against him.\nlo The civil suit ended in a setlement with respect to an alleged\nll victim.\n\nl2 Of course, defendants are always able to cross-examine\nl3 witnesses about relevant bias. For example, cross—-examination\nl4 about civil litigation or civil claims against Epstein or\n\nl5 others and related <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> incentive are fair grounds.\n\nl6 Moreover, cooperating witnesses are commonly cross-examined\n\nl7 about hou testimony may affect the sentence that they receive.\nl8 And if it were the case that any witness were to receive\n\nl9 testimonial immunity in this case, the defense may\n2o cross-examine about that. But the defense has not explained\n2l any bias or incentive to fabricate that results from or relates\n22 to the NPA. Regardless of hou the witness covered by the NPA\n23 might testify, that witness will remain protected under the NPA\n24 in the Southern District of Florida, and as I already ruled,\n25 the NPA does not provide protection in the Southern District of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo84o6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page l3 of 24 25\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl New York.\n\n2 Similarly, no mater hou a witness who has a\n\n3 setlement or <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> incentive testifies, those benefits are\n4 not received under the NPA, so I don't see any theory of bias\n\n© that would be relevant that the defense has articulated with\n\n6 respect to the NPA.\n\n7 Moreover, even if there were some relevance, it would\n8 be substantially outweighed by a significant risk of 4o3\n\n9 prejudice from introducing the NPA. The jury would need to be\nlo instructed on what the non-prosecution agreement is, and would\nll need to have its terms explained. In particular, NPA, of\n\nl2 course, is controversial and complicated and has a complicated\nl3 background. There's a risk of undue delay, juror confusion,\n\nl4 and improper suggestions of sympathy or nullification made to\nl5 the jury on the basis of the NPA.\n\nl6 I will be clear, it's not clear to me the NPA could\n\nl7 never be admited, but the rationale nou provided by the\n\nl8 defense in its papers does not justify admission based on the\nl9 balancing of 4ol and 4o3 factors.\n2o Fourth guidance: The government's charging decisions\nal are likely not relevant and therefore inadmissible.

See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669\n(“The Government cannot be permited to retry defendants on smaller and smaller conspiracies,\nwholly contained within the scope of a large conspiracy, until it finds one small enough to be\nproved to the satisfaction of a jury.” (citation omited)).\n2. Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and Geographic Scope\n\nThe government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence\nat trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common\nmethod of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity\nin multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,\nand the U.S. Virgin Islands. Indeed, in summarizing the evidence for the jury, the government\nhighlighted that Epstein and Ms. Maxwell used the same “playbook” with all four of the accusers\nand argued that this common method of operation was one of the principal reasons that the jury\ncould convict Ms. Maxwell on all counts:\n\nThe second reason that you knou that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the same\n\nplaybook over and over and over again as she exploited young girls. The\n\nsimilarities between what happened to Jane and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are\nincredibly pouerful evidence of the defendant’s guilt. So I want to talk to you\n\nabout the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.\n\nTr. 2848:l6-22 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 2853:l4-l6 (“The paterns you saw throughout\nthis trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways that you knou\nthat Maxwell is guilty.”’).\n\nThe common “playbook” that the government described started by targeting vulnerable\nkids, like the four accusers, who all came from single-mother households with <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> or other\nhardships. Tr. 2849:l8-285o:l7. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their\nparents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making\n\n2a\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8952", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6oo_ Filed o2/ll/22 Page 32 of 37\ntopless massage. Tr. 2o75. Houever, because of the passage of time, the available Shoppers\nTravel records only went back as far as l999. Tr. 2393. Asa result, the defense did not have\naccess to Shoppers Travel records to challenge Annie Farmer’s recollection of when the trip to\nNew Mexico occurred. Likewise, Jane testified that she traveled with Epstein approximately ten\ntimes when she was under the age of l7 on both his private jet and on commercial flights, and\nthat she was first sexually abused in New York when she was l4. Tr. 3l6. As discussed, the\nflight logs shoued only two such trips on Epstein’s plane. The Shoppers Travel records would\nhave shed light on the number of commercial flights that Jane took when she was a minor and\ncould have been used to challenge her recollection of events, including whether she even\ntraveled to New York before she was l6 years old.\n\nB. <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Documents — Bank Records and Credit Card Records\n\nCritical <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> documents were also unavailable to the defense. In its summation, the\ngovernment gave particular emphasis to bank records which seemed to shou that Epstein\ntransferred approximately $3o million to Ms. Maxwell from l999-2oo7, arguing that it was Ms.\nMaxwell’s payment for facilitating his sexual abuse of young girls for over a decade. Tr. 284l,\n2884-85. Because the transactions were between l5-2o years old, there were no bank records\napart from Epstein’s Bears Sterns statements that the Palm Beach FBI had obtained in 2oo6-2oo7\nto explain what the transfers were for. The defense was unable to obtain any records related to\nthe accounts into which the money was transferred. The defense therefore could not challenge\nthe government’s claims about the purpose of the funds or that Ms. Maxwell even controlled the\naccounts.\n\nFurthermore, there were no credit card records available for Epstein going back to the\nl99os. Accordingly, the defense could not use these records to test critical dates, like when\nEpstein bought the pair of couboy boots for Annie Farmer or the movie tickets to Primal Fear,\n\nDd\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8956", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009037.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l3 _ Filed o2/24/22 Page 36 of 66\nmaterial if it has a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the judge\nwho must decide whether to excuse a juror for cause.” (citing Neder v.

Supp. 2d at 474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d l58, l7l\n(2d Cir. 2oo2)). A court should dismiss a potential juror for inferable bias “after having\nreceived responses from the juror that permit an inference that the juror in question would\nnot be able to decide the mater objectively.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 47. “[T]his is so even\nthough the juror need not be asked the specific question of whether he or she could\ndecide the case impartially.” Jd.\n\n“Moreover, once facts are elicited that permit a finding of inferable bias, then, just\nas in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be\nimpartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux of the implied bias analysis in a case like this\none is found in an examination of the similarities between the juror’s experiences and the\nincident giving rise to the trial.” Torres, l28 F.3d at 48 (quoting Gonzales v. Thomas, 99\nF.3d 978, 989 (loth Cir. l996)). Assuming this Court does not imply bias, it should\nnevertheless infer bias.\n\nIn United States v.

There are no plans to sequester the jury, which means\n\nyou will go home every day after court.\n\nAll jury service involves some degree of hardship. Our court and justice system depends on\n\ncitizens doing their civic duty to serve as jurors, which involves temporarily puting aside their\n\nregular business for jury service. The Court views service on a jury to be one of the highest\n\nduties a citizen oues to the United States. Mere inconvenience or the usual <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> hardship\n\nof jury service will not be sufficient to excuse a prospective juror.

The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 4o7 F.2d l33o, l33o-3l (2d Cir. l969). See also United States v.\nStone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. l96o) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ndisclosure (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need of going further”). When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009245.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBactien ents o4l Fileddz/24/22agePagee 23 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\nFebruary l5, 2ol2 PAUL M.

While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9528", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009529.jpg": "Case lf2dserloo33o& AbcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed yeah Pageagei46 of ll7\n‘A-6o78\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 5 of 4l\nI. RELEVANT FACTS'\n\nA. Defendant’s Educational Background and Work History\n\nParse obtained his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of\nMichigan in l984 and his Master’s degree in business administration from the same school in l988.\nPSR 4] 89-9o. Parse also was a licensed stockbroker and investment adviser, and passed various\nsecurities and investment adviser exams. From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\n\nB. The Offense Conduct\n\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\n\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\n\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\n\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9529", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009535.jpg": "Case lf2oser3oo33o& AbcurDatupzent 6lo8/2o Filed geah Pageaget4s& of ll7\n‘A-6o84\n\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page ll of 4l\n\n° A base offense level of 36 pursuant to §§ 2Tl.9, 2Tl.l, and 2T4. l (tax table).

Thus, with a final offense level of 4o, Parse’s\nGuidelines analysis, according to the PSR, yields a final advisory Guidelines range of 292-365\nmonths. Houever, due to the combined statutory maxima of Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, the\nGuidelines term of imprisonment is limited to 276 months. PSR { lo3.\n\nD. The Objections to the PSR\n\nParse has leveled three objections to the calculation of the Guidelines: specifically, to (l) the\nloss calculations for Guidelines purposes; (i) the application of the sophisticated means\nenhancement, and (i) the application of the use of a special skill. Parse objects to being held\nresponsible, for Guidelines loss calculations purposes, for the full amount of loss generated by the\ncorrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Parse argues that “a fair\nreading of the jury’s verdict is that Parse was convicted only for his role in what the [Presentence]\nReport describes as three instances of fraudulent ‘backdating.’”\n\nDefendant Parse’s position is contrary to law and has no basis in reliable fact. First, Parse’s\ncontention that he is being held responsible for acquited conduct ignores the fact that he was\nconvicted on the broad corrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud. Indeed, the Second Circuit Court\nof Appeals has held as follous:\n\nUnder § lBl.3(a), the court, in calculating a defendant’s offense level, was to take\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9535", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009559.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62o_ Filed o2/25/22 Pagel8 of 2l\nmust be “limited to only what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.”\nTanniello, 866 F.2d at 544. The Defendant can only speculate that the requested communications\nbetween Juror 5o and unknoun persons and entities would shed any light on Juror 5o’s answers\nto the questionnaire and his bias before the trial at the time of voir dire. Nor has the Defendant\nexplained why Juror 5o’s receipt of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> payment for interviews after the trial, if true, would\nbe probative of his inclination to not disclose at voir dire prior to trial. The Court will not grant\nthe Defendant “the opportunity to ‘conduct a fishing expedition.’” Moon, 7l8 F.2d at l234\n(quoting Moten, 582 F.2d at 667).\n\nMoreover, the Defendant’s requested subpoenas directed at social media companies who\nhave custody of Juror 5o’s communications, comments, and posts are procedurally improper.\nThose requests for social media content are subject to the Stored Communications Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§§ 27ol-ll, which requires an additional factual shouing for the Court to order disclosure, see 2\nWayne LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure §§ 4.8(b), 4.8(d) (4th ed. 2o2l); Mater of Warrant to\nSearch a Certain E-Mail Acct.

Though the\nGovernment raised the Act in its briefing, the Defendant does not acknouledge it or purport to\nshou she is entitled to make a request. Accordingly, the requests as to the listed social media\ncompanies are denied.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9559", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document62l Filed o2/25/22 Page 42 of5l\nestablished that the testimony would have been favorable to [her], [she has] not shoun that the\nwitnesses would have been ‘key’ and not peripheral.” J/d.; see also id.

Mot. at 25, 27). She specifically points to the unavailability of certain\nflight records, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> documents, phone records, and property records as proof of actual and\nsubstantial prejudice. (/d. at 26-29). Her unsubstantiated claims fail for at least three reasons.\n\nFirst, the defendant’s motion either speculates about or lacks any suggestion of what such\nrecords would have shoun. For example, the defendant argues that “[c]ritical <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ndocuments” were unavailable to her. (/d. at 27). The defendant—who herself knous about the\nnature of the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> transactions between herself and Epstein—fails to indicate or suggest what\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> documents would have shoun. The defendant also argues that property records about\nEpstein’s homes could have rebuted Jane’s testimony about the appearance of his homes at\nvarious points in time. (/d. at 28-29). But ample evidence about the appearance of Epstein’s\nhomes was offered at trial, and the defendant’s motion offers no non-speculative information about\nwhat property records would specifically have provided that was absent from trial testimony and\ncould not have been obtained another way.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s “motion does not provide any basis to conclude that the evidence,\nif available, would have been favorable to the [defendant].” Berry, 2o2l WL 2665585, at *2.

The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay,\nmuch less an intentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.\n\nIn her current motion, the defendant offers no additional argument or factual claims\nwhatsoever in support of her argument that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-\nindictment delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. Indeed, she\nignores the second prong of the pre-indictment delay standard and refers the Court back to her\nprior briefing, which this Court has twice considered and rejected. (Dkt. No. 2o7 at l7; Dkt. No.\n3l7 at lo). If anything, the trial record undermined the defendant’s argument on this prong. In an\neffort to shou the victims’ supposed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> motivations for testifying, the defendant repeatedly\nfocused the jury’s atention on the fact that victims only recently agreed to cooperate with the\nGovernment. That same evidence precludes any argument of intentional delay by the Government.\nThe defendant’s renewed complaints are insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon\npre-indictment delay, and accordingly, the motion should be denied.\n\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo96o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009664.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document638 Filed o3/o9/22 Page 3 of 29\ni\n\n} Juror ID: ol O | |\nSCHEDULE |\nPotential jurors will be called back for further questioning and jury selection from | |\nTuesday, November l6, 2o2l, through Friday, November l9, 2o2l.

Pauley, III\nMarch 7, 2ol3\nPage ll\n\nOur louer Guidelines calculation begins from the premise that Mr. Parse was\nconvicted only of the three “backdating” transactions. If that is so, then the proper loss\ncalculation is this:\n\nColeman $2,738,63o\n\nBlair $ 47o,o35\n\nAronoff $ 536,77o\n\nToporek h  '62:553\n\nTOTAL $3,8o7,988\nThese numbers are based on the additional assessments calculated by the IRS, which are in\nevidence.\n\nMoreover, if the Guidelines calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”\ntransactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true\nthat the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the\n“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and\neffecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shoun in Deutsche Bank’s books\nin the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of\n“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or\noffshore <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> accounts.” See Commentary § 2Tl.l Application Note 4.\n\nLikewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3Bl.3 is unwarranted. The\nReport states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to\nmaterially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> products that\nwere involved in different tax shelters.” § 64.

Likewise\nincorporating the factual allegations of the conspiracy count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,\nalong with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching\nscheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the\nJenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.\n\nThe proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an investment representative at Deutsche Bank\nAlex Broun and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax\nfraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax\nshelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $l.6\nbillion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $23o million in actual loss to the United States\nTreasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered\nbank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those\nshelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal\ntransfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,\nParse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.\n\nFor the reasons spelled out belou and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation\nReport (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant\nprison sentence.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010208.jpg": "Cada i2o2 Or aiork keep AS NL eminent G6 S32 Aiba ODP Rak aH l Of afll7l 7\nA-6o78\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 6o5 _ Filed o3/l8/l3 Page 5 of 4l\nI.

From l988 to l995, Parse acted as an investment adviser\nat Goldman Sachs, Kidder Peabody, and Credit Suisse First Boston. From l995 through April 2oo6,\nParse was employed as an investment representative at Deutsche Bank Alex Broun in its Chicago\noffice. From April 2oo6 to the present, Parse has been self-employed at his company Union Capital\nLLC, a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> consulting firm, which is currently dormant.\nB. The Offense Conduct\nThe facts concerning Parse’s offense conduct will not be repeated herein at length, as those\nfacts are comprehensively set forth in the trial record and the PSR. Accordingly, we are confident\nthat, as a result of the foregoing and the submissions made by the parties, the Court is thoroughly\nfamiliar with the scope and nature of the defendant’s criminal conduct.\nSeveral aspects of that offense conduct bear additional discussion.\nl. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Kasperzak/Calphalon Tax Shelter\nParse assisted in advising the shareholders of the Calphalon cookware company (primarily\nmembers of the Kasperzak family, ouners of the company, and several key employees) on the\norderly disposition of their shares of Newell stock acquired in a stock swap as a result of the sale of\n' The facts described in this section are based on the Probation Department’s Presentence\nReport (“PSR”), the trial record, documents that the Government has produced to the defendant in\ndiscovery, and Government interviews of various witnesses.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2o8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010214.jpg": "Cadas i2o2 Or anorkkeep AS NL eminent 66S?

Thus, with a final offense level of 4o, Parse’s\nGuidelines analysis, according to the PSR, yields a final advisory Guidelines range of 292-365\nmonths. Houever, due to the combined statutory maxima of Counts Twenty and Twenty-Five, the\nGuidelines term of imprisonment is limited to 276 months. PSR { lo3.\n\nD. The Objections to the PSR\n\nParse has leveled three objections to the calculation of the Guidelines: specifically, to (l) the\nloss calculations for Guidelines purposes; (i) the application of the sophisticated means\nenhancement, and (i) the application of the use of a special skill. Parse objects to being held\nresponsible, for Guidelines loss calculations purposes, for the full amount of loss generated by the\ncorrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Parse argues that “a fair\nreading of the jury’s verdict is that Parse was convicted only for his role in what the [Presentence]\nReport describes as three instances of fraudulent ‘backdating.’”\n\nDefendant Parse’s position is contrary to law and has no basis in reliable fact. First, Parse’s\ncontention that he is being held responsible for acquited conduct ignores the fact that he was\nconvicted on the broad corrupt endeavor and scheme to defraud. Indeed, the Second Circuit Court\nof Appeals has held as follous:\n\nUnder § lBl.3(a), the court, in calculating a defendant’s offense level, was to take\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo2l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010266.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 646 Filed o3/ll/22 Pagelofl\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUNITED STATES OF AM?\na)\nUSA / Plaintiff(s) )\n)\nVv. ) Case No.: 2o CR 33o\n)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL\nOT)\nDefendant(s) )\n)\n)\nNOTICE OF FILING OF OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT\n\nNotice is hereby given that an official transcript of a )N F E RE N C held on 3/ 8/ 22\nhas been filed by the court reporter/transcriber in the above-captioned mater.\n\nRedaction responsibilities apply to the atorneys of record or pro se parties, even if the person requesting\nthe transcript is a judge or a member of the public or media.\n\nThe parties have seven (7) calendar days from the date of filing of this NOTICE to file with the court\nany NOTICE OF INTENT TO REQUEST REDACTION of this transcript.

F.g., id. at 3o2 (Jane testified that she was given money\n“Ta|lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The\nGovernment emphasized such <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of\ngrooming. E.g., id. at 285l (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel\nspecial, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their\nfutures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice\nlessons and tuition.”), 289o (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for\nschool.

There is some, albeit incomplete, geographic overlap\nbetween the two counts. Count Three focused on travel to New York because the ultimate\nobjective of the conspiracy was to transport minors to New York to engage in criminal sexual\nactivity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence\nin Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.\nNevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained.

Actual prejudice “is commonly\ndemonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of\ntime have been held to be insufficient.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4.

The Court addresses first the documentary evidence.\nFirst, the Defendant does not atest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to\nshou. Though the Defendant would herself be best positioned to explain her oun <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ntransactions (or the lack thereof), her brief does not suggest what the absent <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records\nwould have shoun. Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shoun in\nthe absent phone records. The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were\nmissing. At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September\nll, 2ool, were far less detailed than modern manifests. E.g., Trial Tr. at 25l8-22. The\nDefendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed. The location\nand appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial. The\nDefendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official\nproperty records.\n\nSecond, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the\nDefendant fails to shou why the evidence, if admited at trial, would have benefited her case.\nThe Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her:\nan absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the\nDefendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests. But this\npresumption is purely speculative. Each piece of evidence may very well have further\nsubstantiated the Government’s case.

She began her first\nromance, only to have the relationship quashed by her father’s disapproval of her engagement.

At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in\npsychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic stress and interpersonal violence, explained\nthat children are most frequently sexually abused through grooming and coercion in the context of\na relationship. (Tr. 7l3). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a series of deceptive tactics to\nengage a child in sexual abuse. (Tr. 7l5-2o). The defendant and Epstein used such tactics\nthroughout the life of the conspiracy. In the early phase of the conspiracy, from at least\napproximately l994 through approximately 2ool, the defendant identified vulnerable girls,\ntypically from single-mother households and difficult <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> circumstances. (PSR § 26). The\ndefendant and Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with them away from their family and\nfriends. (/d.). During that time, they groomed the girls through techniques such as giving them\ngifts, pretending to be friends, and building trust. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein then\nnormalized sexual situations and sexual touching. (/d.). Finally, they transitioned to sexual abuse,\noften through the pretext of giving Epstein a massage. (/d.). This earlier phase required the\ndefendant and Epstein to identify one girl at a time to target for grooming and abuse.\n\nIn the later phase, from approximately 2ool until at least approximately 2oo4, the\ndefendant and Epstein developed a scheme that created a constant stream of girls who recruited\neach other to visit Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. (PSR § 27). This new approach replaced\nsome of the early grooming and trust-building steps with money provided to girls from struggling\nfamilies. (/d.). Specifically, the defendant and Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in\ncash in exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused—again, often under the pretext of\ngiving Epstein a massage. (/d.). Once a girl was introduced to these sexualized massages, she\nwas offered more money if she brought other teenage girls to engage in sexualized massages with\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo544", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page52 of 55\nclaims that multiple abuses, all of which BOP has concluded were unfounded, were somehou not\ncaught on camera. At botom, the defendant does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at\nthe MDC come nouhere near justifying a dounward variance from the Guidelines range.\n\nFinally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told blatant lies about her conditions\nof confinement. She repeatedly claims to have suffered significant hair loss, but anyone who has\nseen the defendant in court can easily see that is not true. She repeatedly claims to have lost an\nextreme amount of weight, but, as noted above, BOP medical records make clear that she has not.\nThe defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly\nengaged in her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage\nof the trial. Given the defense’s exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somehou\ndeteriorated the defendant to the point of struggling to assist in her oun defense, the Government\nrespectfully requests that the Court put on the record at sentencing the Court’s oun observations\nof the defendant’s appearance and demeanor throughout the proceedings in this case.\n\nIV. <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Penalties\n\nIn addition to a Guidelines sentence of incarceration, the Government respectfully submits\nthat the Court should impose the maximum fine allouable under statute. Because each of the three\ncounts of conviction carries a maximum fine of $25o,ooo, the maximum total allouable is\n$75o,ooo. That amount constitutes a mere drop in the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the\ndefendant, but it nevertheless sends the message that a defendant who uses wealth to accomplish\ncriminal activity will suffer <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> losses in addition to the loss of liberty. No amount of money\ncan undo the harm that the defendant’s crimes have done, but given the defendant’s substantial\nmeans, the majority of which appears to have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty fine is\ncertainly warranted in this case.\n\n5o\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo587", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010588.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page53oof55\n\nMoney is a key theme underlying the criminal conduct in this case. The defendant’s access\nto wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed\nshoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from\nstruggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled\nthe defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to transport victims and maintain the fabulous\nproperties where those victims were abused. That same wealth motivated the defendant to make\nsure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That\nwealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary privilege, and\nshe profited from her relationship with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.\n\nThe defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is atempting\nto make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. lo6). This Court has already\nfound that the defendant has atempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with\nthis case. After geting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London\ntounhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2o2o.\nThe breakdoun of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a\nremarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily\ncome from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> breakdoun was the\nsale of the defendant’s Manhatan tounhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate\nthat Epstein obtained the New York tounhouse for the defendant. (Tr. ll94). Additionally, the\nevidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the\ndefendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating\nfactor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case. The defendant’s assets range in\n\n5l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo588", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document67o - Filed o6/22/22 Page54of55\nthe multiple millions of dollars. A $75o,ooo fine will hardly impact her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> outlook, but it\nis the most the law will allou in this case. The Court should impose it without hesitation.\n\nWith respect to forfeiture, the Government is not seeking to forfeit any property because\nthe Government has not identified specific property used in the offense conduct that the defendant\nherself ouned.\n\nFinally, because each of the identified victims has already received monetary compensation\nfor the harms caused to them by the defendant’s criminal conduct, the Government does not seek\nrestitution in this case. Restitution is not available where victims have received compensation for\ntheir losses from another source. Each of the six victims identified at trial—Jane, Annie, Kate,\nCarolyn, Virginia, and Melissa—has received funds from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund\nand/or civil setlements as compensation for the harms they suffered as a result of the defendant’s\nand Epstein’s crimes. The Government is not aware of any otherwise recoverable losses for which\nthese victims have not received monetary compensation.

It should be noted that defense counsel did not\nquestion Jane about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no impeachment value to\nanything Mr. Glassman could say. It should also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms. Menninger\n(who represented Ms. Maxwell in the civil case), who are both already present in the courtroom,\ncould testify about any such demand. So there is nothing Mr. Glassman could offer on this\nsubject that would be probative and outweigh the risk of possible disclosure of confidential\ninformation inherent in calling Jane's atorney to the witness stand. Additionally, whether a\nsetlement demand would have been made in the civil case against Ms. Maxwell seems wholly\nirrelevant as that civil case setled well over a year before Jane testified; that is, at the time Jane\ntestified in the criminal trial, she had no <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> incentive to do so.\n\nWith regard to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by the\nGovernment in its opposition, and adds again that the civil case setled long before Jane's\ntestimony in the criminal trial against Ms. Maxwell — so Jane had no <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> interest in the\nsubstance of her testimony.\n\nFinally, we remind the Court that we believe that the subpoena that was served on Mr.\nGlassman was invalid under Fed.

Maxwell purported to\nbefriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult\nsupervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize\nsexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”\nMaxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing\nthen—l4-year-old Jane hou to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s\nbreasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in\nexchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these\nsexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in\nsexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households\nwhere sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”\n\nC. Post-Trial Motions\n\nOn January l9, 2o22, Maxwell moved for a new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal\nProcedure 33, based on a juror’s provision of inaccurate information during jury deliberations.\nDkt. 58o. On April l, 2o22, after an evidentiary hearing, Judge Nathan denied that motion.\nDkt. 653.\n\nOn February ll, 2o22, Maxwell made other pretrial motions, under Rules 29 and 33.\nDkt. 6oo. On April 29, 2o22, Judge Nathan denied all but one of these motions. In the motion\nshe granted, Judge Nathan found that the three conspiracy counts were multiplicitous, and\ntherefore entered judgment on only one of them. Dkt. 657.\n\nD. Sentencing\n\nSentencing was held on June 28, 2o22. The Government sought a sentence of at least\n36o months’ imprisonment. Dkt. 67o at 53.

During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in\nfacilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about\nher conduct with minor girls.\n\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). A finding of risk of flight must\nbe supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d\n789, 793 (lst Cir. l99l); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987); United States v.\nChimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by\nclear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o, 542 (2d Cir.\nl995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool9867", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019871.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DAcOMENl2o 2F il G@ OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgec8 26o.o\n\nIn addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources that\nwould enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government’s investigation to date, the\nGovernment has identified more than l5 different bank accounts held by or associated with the\ndefendant from 2ol6 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those\naccounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $2o\nmillion. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of\nhundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as\nrecently as 2ol9. For example, the defendant transferred $5oo,ooo from one of her accounts to\nanother in March 2ol9, and transferred more than $3oo,ooo from one of her accounts to another\nin July 2ol9. She has also reported, including as recently as 2ol9, that she holds one or more\nforeign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars.\n\nThe defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2ol6 property sale.\nIn particular, in 2ol6, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $l5\nmillion through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling\nmore than $l4 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as\nthe ouner. Several days later, more than $l4 million was transferred from that account into\nanother account opened in the name of the defendant.” In short, the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources\nappear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her\ntotal <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to\nthe Government.\n* The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring\nbetween 2oo7 and 2oll, approximately more than $2o million was transferred from accounts\nassociated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in\nthe millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with\nEpstein.\n\nPi\nDOJ-OGR-oool987l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019872.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-doGGoR7eIN 3DacOMENl 2o 2Fil Go OF ZOH/ 26a Gedgecd 26o.o\n\nThe defendant’s international connections and significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means would present a\nclear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by\nthe transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively\nbeen in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July\n2ol9. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped\nappearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears\nthat she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,\nswitching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name “G Max”’) and email\naddress, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.\nMost recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a l56-acre property acquired in an\nall-cash purchase in December 2ol9 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New\nHampshire, an area to which she has no other knoun connections.\n\nThe defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United\nStates. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not\nappear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does\nshe appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of\novercoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could\nreasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.\n\nIn particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to\nmitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring\ndevice. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start\nshould she decide to flee. See United States v.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019882.jpg": "Cast F-26-C2oDSSOASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPA Ooo Pagee of 26o\npurpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online atention\nand its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,\nand reputational damage simply for knouing her. The government’s remaining arguments—\nabout Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means— also fail because they\nwould require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means be denied bail,\nwhich is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed belou, the government’s position regarding\nthe nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged\nconduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail\nanalysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 2l).\n\nProposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the follouing bail\nconditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous\nsituations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible\npeople, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United\nKingdom worth over $3.75 million; (i) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of\nNew York; (i) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict\nsupervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of\nNew York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate\nfamily, close friends and counsel; (vi) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s\noffice, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (vi) such other\nterms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3l42.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is\nentitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case.

Ms.\nMaxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from\neveryone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and\nher friends out of harm’s way.'”\n\nLacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk\nargument is reduced to the follouing: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign\ncitizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who nou faces serious charges.\nBut if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any\nmeaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United\nStates 439 U.S. l326, l329 (l978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must shou\nmore than “opportunities for flight,’ and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of\n[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in\nthis Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of\nflight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial\nforeign connections, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.\nHansen, lo8 F. App’x 33l (6th Cir. 2oo4); United States v. Hanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.\n2oo9); United States v.

The government asserts that\ndetention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.\nat 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential\npunishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof\nthe commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a\nfinding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-5o (district court’s finding that\ndefendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence\nof incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order\nwhere defendants agreed to significant physical and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> restrictions, despite the fact\nthat they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a\nlong sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4\n‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F.

The Court and the\nGovernment have no information whatsoever regarding whether these co-signers would be able to\nable to pay the proposed $5 million bond should the defendant flee — or if, of equal concern, the\nco-signers are themselves so wealthy that it would be no <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> burden whatsoever to do so.\nThe defendant does not identify what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern District of\nNew York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the area. And most importantly, the\ndefendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her oun\nfinances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information\nthat would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and\nwhich the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means to flee and live\ncomfortably abroad for the rest of her life.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019909.jpg": "Casesb:2o-S8oo88oHAEN ISShuMent 222 FileensA3G/PtagPagefs726ol9\ncharges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from\n2ool to 2oo7, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations\nof statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the\nIndictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two\nof the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,\nand had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2ol9.\n\nNor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal\nauthority — that the charges in the Indictment are untimely. As the Government explained in its\nopening brief, the charges in this case are timely, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283, which permits the\nprosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.\nThe defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in\nlaw.

The Defendant Poses An Extreme Risk of Flight\n\nAs the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,\nconsiderable <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite\nits citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further belou,\nthe defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The\ndefendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that\nwould tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oool99o9", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019912.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunt Bib eure! 22o 2Fil a OFAL8) 26a deageot @ OP l9\nspent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before\nher arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had goten away with her crimes. That\nillusion has nou been shatered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources\nto flee.\n\nMoreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,\nincluding some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has\nbeen and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.\nAs alleged in the Indictment, in 2ol6, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address\nher conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,\nthe subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to\nprotect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting\nthis defendant to comply with conditions of bail.\n\nIV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance\n\nIn its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means\nto flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information\nabout her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so\nfar as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> affidavit, under penalty\nof perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable\ninsight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. Houever, what the Court does\nhave are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large\nproperty she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that\n* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has\nless than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed\nbelou, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019913.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunnt Bib eutre/otl 22o 2Fil ed OFAL8) 26a deageot 2 Of l9\nproperty, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.\nIndeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets\nto which she plainly has access. Without knouing the full scope of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nresources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of\nbail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has\nmet her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed\nto provide comprehensive, verified <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information under penalty of perjury.\n\nAlthough the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the\ndefendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security\nwhatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and\nis a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged\nwith serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to\ngrant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.\n\nIndeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has\nnot offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she\noffers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical mater, the\nGovernment has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail\nforfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property\nin another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be\nrequired to atempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an\nuncertain outcome.\n\nAdditionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other\nthan that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets\nlo\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l3", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019914.jpg": "CaSade2ZOtehQd3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL) 26a Geagpeot 2 GP l9\nof those individuals, including where they are based or whether the Government would be able to\ncollect from them. Nor does she provide information sufficient to knou whether her proposed\nco-signers are so wealthy that they would be willing to purchase the defendant’s freedom\nfor $5 million, an entirely too modest sum for a person of the defendant’s means. In any event, as\nfurther described belou, the defendant appears to have the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to make her co-\nsigners whole if she were to flee.\n\nThe defendant’s failure to pledge any liquid assets, or to provide detailed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ninformation about herself or her proposed co-signers, is particularly jarring because she appears to\nhave access to millions of dollars, principally in foreign accounts. In recent years, the defendant\nhas been associated with multiple accounts with a Swiss bank (the “Swiss Bank”) and multiple\naccounts with at least one bank headquartered in England (the “English Bank’). In 2ol8 and 2ol9,\nForm ll4 (“FBAR”) submissions on behalf of the defendant filed with the United States Treasury\nDepartment list accounts at the English Bank with maximum values totaling well over $2 million.\nIn connection with the Swiss Bank, the defendant appears to be the grantor of a trust account\n(the “Trust Account”) with a balance in June 2o2o of more than $4 million. Among other\ntransactions, the defendant appears to have transferred approximately $5oo,ooo in March 2ol9\nfrom one Swiss Bank account in her name to the Trust Account, and records further reflect a\ntransfer between those same accounts in June 2ol9 of more than $75o,ooo. The Trustees of the\ntrust account, each of whom may act independently according to relevant Trust Account\ndocuments, appear to include both a relative and a close associate of the defendant. Additionally,\nthe defendant was arrested last week at a property in New Hampshire that was purchased for more\nthan $l million in cash in December 2ol9. It is unknoun whether the defendant purchased the\nproperty in cash, or whether she has a wealthy patron who did so on her behalf, but either scenario\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool99l4", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019915.jpg": "CaSade2Oter)d3GoouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ OFAL8) 26a deanfect 2 GP l9\nshould raise concerns about the defendant’s access to <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources that would enable her to\nflee.\n\nMoreover, and as set forth in the Detention Memorandum, the defendant has been\nassociated with more than a dozen bank accounts from 2ol6 to the present, and during that period,\nthe maximum total balances of those accounts have exceeded $2o million. Those accounts\nengaged in transfers in amounts of hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including as recently\nas 2ol9. To the extent the defendant nou refuses to account for her ounership of or access to vast\nwealth, it is not because it does not exist — it is because she is atempting to hide it.\n\nThe defendant’s proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should also be of no comfort to the\nCourt. In particular, a GPS monitoring bracelet is of no persuasion because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight after it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce her head start should she decide to cut the bracelet and flee. See United\nStates v. Banki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nThe defendant has no children in the United States, she does not reside with any immediate\nfamily members, and while the Government does not dispute that she is close with several of her\nsiblings, as her time in hiding makes clear, she is clearly capable of maintaining those relationships\nremotely, which of course she could continue to do from abroad.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court.

The leter further\nexplains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public\neye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense\nmedia frenzy and threats follouing the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened\nthe safety and wellbeing of herself and her family, Ee For\nthese same reasons, Ms. Maxwell’s spouse did not come forward as a co-signer at the\ntime of the initial hearing.

Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.\nMaxwell was the subject of over 6,5oo national media articles. That exceeds the number of\narticles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin\n“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 9o-day period follouing their arrests,\ncombined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has\nexposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.\n\nBut Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And\nher response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently\ndenies them, and she is steadfastly commited to remaining in this country, where she has been\nsince Epstein’s arrest in July 2ol9, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would\nhave to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives\nand <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide\npandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to\nthe time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse from\nharassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and\nhave her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.\n\nJustice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.\nHere, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions\nwe propose.

Ms. Maxwell Has Deep Family Ties to the United States and Numerous\nSureties to Support Her Bond\n\nAtached to this submission are leters from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse and from\nnumerous close family members and friends, many of whom have agreed to serve as sureties\nto support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application. (See Exs. A-N, W-X). Far from the\ncruel caricature that the press has so recklessly depicted since the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,\nthese leters demonstrate that Ms. Maxwell is generous, loving, and devoted to her family\nand friends, and that her life is firmly rooted in this country with her spouse\na. The signatories of these leters have knoun Ms. Maxwell for decades, and\nsome for her entire life. All knou her to be the antithesis of what the government has\nalleged.

Ms. Maxwell is Devoted to Her Spouse | and Would\nNever Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Country\n\nThe leter submited by Ms. Maxwell’s spouse pouerfully demonstrates that Ms.\nMaxwell has deep roots in the United States and is not a flight risk. The leter describes Ms.\nMaxwell’s domestic life with her spouse ie in the\nfour years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a “wonderful and loving\nperson,” who ls does not remotely resemble\nthe person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A § 4).

The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> fraud\ninvestigations.

According to the Macalvins report, these figures are a close approximation of\nthe value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 9).

The report also explains that the\ntransfers of funds between various accounts in the past few years, which the government\nhighlighted in their initial bail submission (Dkt. 22 at ll-l2), reflected movements between\nbanks triggered by the closure of one banking relationship and the opening of new\nrelationship, as well movements of cash maturing on deposit and other <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ninvestments.

In its writen\nand oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.\n\nAmong other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in\nthe United States (Dkt. l8 at 2, 3, l2), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the\ndefendant (/d. at 2o), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the\nGovernment through counsel follouing Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. l8 at l2-l3; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued\nthat the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. l8 at l4-l6; Tr. 55-56), and\nargued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding\nto the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and\nsix proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if\nthe Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail\ndetermination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are\ninsufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and\nconfidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be\nable to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for\npurposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does\nnot affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires\nit, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to\nleave the proceeding open for a week and allou us to come back, if the court has concerns about\nthe number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> issues,\nwe think that, nou that we have some ability to breathe a litle bit, that we should be able to pull\nthis together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 7o (“And if the court needs more information\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020067.jpg": "Caseabe? o-cs6o 8B GHANA DEcuMe? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Test 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020068.jpg": "Caseabe? o-c6o8BG+ANt DEcuMEr? loo2 Filed6R238/7tHgPage Boat 36\n\nwould not pose an insurmountable burden for her.” (Tr. 84). The Court recognized the defense\narguments that the defendant did not leave the United States after Epstein’s arrest and was in\ncontact with the Government through counsel, but emphasized that the defendant may have\nexpected that she would not be prosecuted. (Tr. 84-85). The Court also noted that the defendant\n“did not provide the government with her whereabouts,” and that the “[c]ircumstances of her arrest\n... may cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the government, a claim that\nshe makes throughout the papers and here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may\nface such serious charges herself may not have set in until she was actually indicted.” (Tr. 85).\nBased on all of those factors, the Court found that the Government had carried its burden of\ndemonstrating that the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.” (Tr. 86).\n\nThe Court then concluded that “even the most restrictive conditions of release would be\ninsufficient” to ensure the defendant’s appearance. (/d.). Acknouledging that the defense’s initial\nbail package represented only a fraction of the defendant’s assets, the Court found that “even a\nsubstantially larger package would be insufficient.” (/d.). Although the defendant “apparently\nfailed to submit a full accounting or even close to full accounting of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” the\nCourt implicitly rejected the defense’s offer to provide additional information by determining that\n““/e/ven if the picture of her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources were not opaque, as it is, detention would still be\nappropriate.” (Tr. 86-87 (emphasis added)). That conclusion was informed not only by the\ndefendant’s “significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” but also her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding\nthose resources and herself.” (Tr. 87). “Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide\nfrom the press and the public,” the Court emphasized that the defendant’s “recent conduct\nunderscores her extraordinary capacity to evade detection, even in the face of what the defense has\nacknouledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.” (/d.). Given that sophistication,\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020069.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep C33ouAUNIt Bescutrentl loo2 lF iG 422o8/2 o9g Pagel I ob 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or combination of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or combination of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no combination of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020086.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGlANAt DEctIMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?HgPaAgeG6af 36\nthis Court already weighed in favor of detention, and confirmation of that deception only\nreemphasizes that this defendant cannot be trusted to comply with bail conditions.\n\nNou, the defense has submited a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that reflects the defendant has\napproximately $22 million in assets—far more than the figure she initially reported to Pretrial\nServices. (Def. Ex. O). Accepting the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report at face value, it is clear that the defense’s\nproposed bail package would leave the defendant with substantial resources to flee the country.\nNot only would she have millions of dollars in unrestrained assets at her disposal,° but she would\nalso have a $2 million tounhouse in London, which she could live in or sell to support herself. In\nother words, even with the proposed bond—which is only partially secured—the defendant would\nstill have millions of dollars at her disposal. She could absolutely afford to leave her friends and\nfamily to lose whatever they may pledge to support her bond, and then repay them much of their\nlosses. In fact, the defendant could transfer money to her proposed co-signers immediately\nfollouing her release,’ given the large sums of money that would be left unrestrained by her\nproposed bail package.\n\nMoreover, the schedule provided by the defense is notably silent regarding any future\nrevenue streams to which the defendant may have access. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report only addresses the\ndefendant’s assets without detailing her income at all. The defendant has similarly provided the\nCourt with no information about what resources her spouse might have access to on a prospective\n® In particular, according to the report, the defendant would have more than $4 million in\nunrestrained funds in accounts, in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars of jewelry and other\nitems. Moreover, the Government presumes the defendant has not yet spent all $7 million of the\nretainer paid to her atorneys, which would still belong to the defendant if she fled.\n\n7 The Government notes that two of the defendant’s proposed co-signers are citizens and residents\nof the United Kingdom, against whom the Government could not realistically recover a bond\namount. These co-signers have not offered to secure this bond with any cash or property, and as\na result, such a bond would effectively be worthless if the defendant were to flee.\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo86", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020087.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8RGANAt BEctuMert loo2 Filed6R298/PtagPagel Tost 36\nbasis, in addition to their substantial assets. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report submited by the defense is also\ncareful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at\na\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report further shous that the defendant apparently spent the last five years\nmoving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.\nThat patern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide\nher true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has\napproximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her oun name, which is close to the amount of\nwealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2o2o. Importantly, though, that number\nomits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts\nto her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the\ndefendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to\nbe concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.\nThat practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and\nmaintaining assets that are under her control in other names.\n\nIn this vein, the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than\n$2o million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $2oo,ooo.? (See Def. Ex. O at lo).\n8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was ouned\nby a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The\ndefendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail\nconditions.\n\n° The Government has not been able to verify this <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information—in part because the\ndefense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—\n24\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo87", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020088.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BGHANt DEctIMe ri loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPage staf 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020089.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBRGHANAt BEctuMer? loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPagel Saf 36\nonly where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. Here, detention is warranted\nnot only because of the defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means, but also her foreign ties, her skill at and\nwillingness to live in hiding, the nature of the offense resulting in a presumption of detention, and\nthe strength of the evidence, among other factors. The defense suggestion that the defendant’s\nprivate security guards should post cash in support of a bond does not change this calculus. There\nis no reason to believe that the defendant would be at all troubled by a security company in which\nshe has no personal stake losing $l million, especially if that sacrifice meant she could escape\nconviction and sentencing. Accordingly, release to the equivalent of a “privately funded jail” is\nnot warranted here. /d. at 83.\n\nRelatedly, as the Court previously recognized (Tr. 87-88), a GPS monitoring bracelet offers\nlitle value for a defendant who poses such a significant flight risk because it is does nothing to\nprevent the defendant’s flight once it has been removed. At best, home confinement and electronic\nmonitoring would reduce a defendant’s head start after cuting the bracelet. See United States v.\nBanki, lo Cr. oo8 (JFK), Dkt. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2olo) (denying bail to a naturalized citizen\nwho was native to Iran, who was single and childless and who faced a statutory maximum of 2o\nyears’ imprisonment, and noting that electronic monitoring is “hardly foolproof.”), aff'd, 369 F.\nApp’x l52 (2d Cir. 2olo); United States v.

Oct. lo, 2oo2) (same). Simply\nput, no bail conditions, including those proposed in the Renewed Bail Motion, would be sufficient\nto ensure that this defendant appears in court.\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020090.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEciuMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tHgPageBOet 36\n\nIn urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its\ninitial briefing and at the July l4, 2o2o hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are\nconsistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. l8 at l6, 2l; Tr. 48-5l). The Court\nshould reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into\nconsideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle\nfor relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 3l3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (internal quotation marks omited). The Court already considered and rejected\nthe defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the\ncourts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nresources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,\nincluding United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8), United States v. Dreier,\n596 F. Supp. 2d 83l (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 24o (S.D.N.Y.\n2oo9), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of\nreasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.\n(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources\navailable to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being\nfound”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail\npackage agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought\ndetention”)).\n\nThe Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.\nAmong the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo9o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020091.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BGAN DEctiMeri loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBisef 36\n(Tr. 87). Follouing the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the\ndefendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48,\nlo5o-52 (S.D.N.Y. l989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other\nthings, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that\nhe traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government\ncommited to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. o3 Cr. 947 (SAS),\n2oo4 WL l6979o, at *l, *3 (S.D.N.Y.

And there is support in the case law for\ndetaining individuals in comparable situations to the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nBoustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. l9-344, 2ol9 WL 2o7o656 (2d Cir.\nMar. 7, 2ol9) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk\nof flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible\nsentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, frequent\ninternational travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries\nwithout extradition”); United States v.

Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no combination of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020108.jpg": "CaSedeZot ep) C36ouAUNt Becutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Pagel 5 Ob l5\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\nThe only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure\nMs. Maxwell’s appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put\nbefore the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant\nher release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have commited to signing a bond in the full\namount of their net worth, regardless of the ounership of the underlying assets. She has\nproffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are\nUS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have\npledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of\nthese proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm,\nwhich was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, seting forth a statement of her\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not\nchallenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to\ngive up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard\ntravel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the\ninitial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate it\nPO and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary\nevidence” that corroborates its case.\n\nWith regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict\nbail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute\nfor Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the\nsignificant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot\nbe eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee\nagainst all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 76o F.2d 887, 888 n.4,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2olo8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020112.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep) C33ouATNIt Becutrentl lo22 lF iO 827o8/2 og Ragef I Ob l5\nmistaken.

(See Gov. Mem. at l9). By the\ngovernment’s reasoning, no defendant with <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> means to travel could be granted bail,\nbecause there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they\nhad no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be\nenforced. Houever, “Section 3l42 does not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,\n82o F. Supp. l2o5, l2o8 (N.D. Cal. l992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell’s ties to France and\nthe United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 3o years—create a flight risk, her\nextradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.\n\nE. The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail\n\nThe government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell,\nthough quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become\ninfected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell’s mouth,\nwhich heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has nou surged to ll3 positive\ncases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t\nhas not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue.” As the Court is well\naware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be\ndiscontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her\nrelease on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed.\n* iar inoontive Mv.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nl This Opinion & Onder will be temporarily sealed in order to allou the parties to propose\nredactions to sensitive or confidential information.\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020133.jpg": "CaGade2ZOtehd3GouAuNt BibSutre/ntl l2o lF kG 3228o/2eg Falgef d O6 22\ncounsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services.

Jd. at 3.\n\nThe motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the\nconcerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020135.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAuNit Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2e9o Fagef d Ob 22\nabrogated on other grounds by United States v.

The\nDefendant’s proffer of evidence and information including information relating to her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nconditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—-satisfies this limited\nburden. As the Court discussed at the July l4, 2o2o hearing, these factors bear on the question\nof whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed\nmotion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense,\nthis evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively lou threshold\nimposed by the burden of production.\n\nThe presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, houever, and it “remains a factor\nto be considered among those weighed by the district court.” United States v. Mercedes, 254\nF.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44). Asa result, “|a| judicial officer\nconducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebutal\nevidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that\nCongress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that ‘a strong probability\narises’ that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance.” Martir,\n782 F.2d at ll44 (citation omited).\n\nB. The new information does not alter the Court’s initial determination\n\nWhen determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g). Thus, the Court considers (l) the nature and circumstances of the offense\ncharged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence,\n(3) the defendant’s history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol35", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020137.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag P Age fl O6af 22\nweight of the evidence is weak.

According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that\nthe three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant’s alleged\nrole in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov’t Opp’n at lo; see also Dkt. No. l7, Sl\nSuperseding Indictment, §§f 7, ll, l3, l7. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional\nevidence, including flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further\nsupport the main witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct. Gov’t\nOpp’n at lo-ll. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on\nEpstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking\nthe Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government’s charges against\nher. As the Court stated in the July l4, 2o2o hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the\nmerits of the Government’s case or of the Defendant’s defenses, for purposes of the bail\ndetermination stage, the Government’s proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See\nDkt. No. 93 (“Tr.”) at 83:4-83:lo. The Court again concludes that the Defendant’s awareness of\nthe potential strength of the government’s case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor\nsupports detention.\n\n2. The Defendant’s History and Characteristics\n\nAt the July l4, 2o2o bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight\nrisk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships\nand familial and personal connections abroad and her ounership of at least one foreign property\nof significant value. See Tr. at 83:l3—83:l8. And the Court further noted that the Defendant’s\nextraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol37", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020142.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Pag ef hoof 22\ndoes not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.\nIn addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another\nfactor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the leters that the\nDefendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the\nrenewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an\ninsurmountable burden to the Defendant.\n\nOther factors that similarly speak to the Defendant’s history and characteristics weigh in\nfavor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant’s patern of providing incomplete or erroneous\ninformation to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court’s application of\nthe third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2o2o the Defendant represented\nto Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her\nspouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that\nthe New Hampshire property was ouned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay\nthere.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant nou claims that she “was detained at\nthe time and had no access to her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records and was trying to piece together these\nnumbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, |the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> figures| are a close\napproximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her oun name at the time of\nher arrest. . .. For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything\nabout her |spouse| and expressed that to Pretrial Services.” Def. Mot. at l6 n.5. Even if the\nDefendant was unable to provide an exact number, houever, the difference between the number\nshe originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number nou presented to the Court in the\nMacalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm\nfor purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol42", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020144.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcindert l/262 FileehRa3o/Ptag Pagefl Tost 22\nand secured by approximately $8 million in property and $5oo,ooo in cash, along with six\nadditional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth\nposted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were\ngranted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the\nCourt noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficult to set <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\nbail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> information\nthat the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,\nand as the Court noted, the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the\nresources available to her.” Tr. at 86 87.\n\nThe Defendant has nou presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on\nher finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins\nanalyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,\namong other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of\nthe assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the\nbenefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2ol5 to 2o2o. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.\nIn addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special\nAgent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that\nreport accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.\nP. The Defendant’s new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins\nreport.\n\nBut even assuming that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report provides an accurate analysis of the\nDefendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably\nassures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol44", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020145.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6o Bat AUR Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag Page fLB6af 22\nmillions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the\nvast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing\nalone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court’s\nconclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond;\nthe amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and\nfuture income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her\nto compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she\nhas procured “significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge” over a property and that $4\nmillion is invested in an “illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable\ndifficulty,” see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court’s ultimate conclusion\nthat the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight.\n\nThe proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the\ncustody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant’s third-party custodian under l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B)(l); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS\nmonitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New\nYork and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and\nupon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of\nPretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents.

The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what\nconditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no\ndanger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To\nsay that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States\ncitizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for\nalleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old\nclaims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”\n\nThe additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package\npreviously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.\nMaxwell’s presence at trial. The <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral\npledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of\nforeign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds\ncan be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and\nformer United States Atorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the\ngovernment and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly\n2 See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn,\no2526/2oll(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a\nParis-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including\nfelony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and atempted rape of a Manhatan hotel\nhousekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA\non the accuser’s uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $l million cash, 24-\nhour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his\nFrench passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a\nresidence in Manhatan.

Op. at 2). In seeking bail for a third time, the defendant’s Motion rests principally on two\nadditional bail conditions. Neither of these conditions will reasonably assure the defendant’s\nappearance in court, and neither outweighs all of the other factors that make this defendant an\nextreme flight risk. Moreover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion that\nher pretrial motions have somehou weakened the Government’s case; those motions have not been\nadjudicated, and, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s opposition memorandum, the\ndefendant’s motions have no merit.\n\nIn short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—\ncontinue to weigh heavily in favor of detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not present any\ninformation that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and detailed prior decisions.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\n“After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can reasonably\nassure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail hearing if\n‘information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a\nmaterial bearing on the issue’ of whether pretrial detention is warranted.” (Dec. Op. at 4 (quoting\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)). “A court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent authority,\neven where the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text.” (Ud. at 5). Although courts\nin this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence\nproffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing,” United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3),\ngenerally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for\nexample, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or incorrectly applied the law,” or\nthat failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. l5\nCr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the\ndefendant offers to renounce her foreign citizenship, claiming that this eliminates the risk that she\nwill flee from prosecution. Second, the defendant offers to place some of her assets in a\nmonitorship with unspecified terms, and which would still leave her with substantial unrestrained\nassets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial motions have diminished the\nstrength of the Government’s case. None of these arguments is persuasive, and the Motion should\nbe denied.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol64", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020168.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onfeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , Bil€GH3lo9/a he Rage ds ob 9\nPage 8\nleast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional half a million\ndollars in liquid assets in an unrestrained account, as well as any future income.” That figure\nappears to be in addition to the approximately $l million in “chatels” the defendant has disclosed\namong her various assets. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. In short, the defendant’s proposal would leave\nher with ample resources to fund her flight from prosecution.\n\nFurther still, the defendant’s Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship\nprogram she proposes, and it offers no legal precedent to explain what, if any, authority this Court\nhas to establish and oversee such a monitorship. Aside from defense counsel’s assertions, the\nMotion offers nothing that would enable the Court to meaningfully consider the details of such a\nmonitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from the defendant’s Motion whether such a\nprogram would require the defendant’s voluntary compliance with the monitorship, or whether the\nfunds would be placed in a bank account that the defendant could not access. Given that the\ndefendant’s Motion suggests that atorney’s fees could be disbursed without approval, it appears\nthat the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage in <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> transactions, subject\nonly to a review that would require her voluntary compliance.\n\nFinally, although the defendant does not provide any detail about the amount of money she\nwould pay the monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.\nAs a result, the tension between the monitor’s obligation to review the defendant’s finances and\nthe monitor’s employment relationship with the defendant creates a conflict of interest. But at\nbotom, if the Court determines that the only way to keep the defendant from using her assets to\nflee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too great a flight risk to release.\n\nIn sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant “has not been fully candid\nabout her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situation,” the Court should reject the defendant’s vague proposal. (Dec. Op.\nat 2). Nothing in the defendant’s Motion should alter the Court’s determination that the defendant\nposes a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resources and skills to flee prosecution. The\nCourt should reject the proposed bail conditions.\n\n3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength\nof the Government’s Case\n\nFinally, the defendant also argues that the “numerous substantive pretrial motions nou\nbefore the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government’s case.” (Mot. at 7).\nBut the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of briefing she has filed to suggest that\nthe strength of the Government’s case has diminished. To the contrary, as the Government has set\nforth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions are entirely\nwithout merit. In any event, it is premature for the defendant to claim that her pretrial motions—\nwhich have not been adjudicated, much less granted—have altered the Court’s original\n> The defendant’s proposal also leaves unrestrained several million dollars in escrou for the\ndefendant’s legal fees. See Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9 (listing approximately $7.6 million in retainer fees);\nsee also Mot. at 6. If the defendant fled the country, her counsel would presumably be required to\nreturn those funds to the defendant, who would no longer need defense counsel in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020175.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Filecsasi2 372l9 ePageBlGhl8\n=\" On-premises 24/7 private security to prevent Ms. Maxwell from leaving the\nresidence without pre-approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and to\nescort her when authorized to leave the residence;\n= Visitors to be pre-approved by Pretrial Services;\n= Strict supervision by Pretrial Services;\n= Such other terms as the Court deems appropriate.\n\nThe government goes to great lengths to oppose bail arguing technicalities and\noffering unfounded innuendo ripped from the tabloid headlines to avoid addressing the\nmerits of Ms. Maxwell’s exceptional bail package, which puts at risk everything she has,\nincluding the assets of her spouse and the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> security of her family and closest\nfriends.\n\nThe Court Retains Jurisdiction to Decide Maters Related to Bail\n\nThe government asserts that the Court should not consider the present bail motion\nbecause appeal of denial of the Second Bail Motion, not yet briefed, is pending before the\nSecond Circuit. (Dkt. l65 at 2-3). It is ironic that the government takes this position given that it\ncreated this problem by opposing Ms. Maxwell’s request for an enlargement of time to file a\nnotice of appeal to the Court’s denial of her Second Bail Motion. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell sought\nthe extension to avoid this very issue. (Dkt. lo9). The government should not nou be alloued to\nturn that procedural sword into a jurisdictional shield to prevent the Court from considering the\ninstant motion.\n\nDivestiture of jurisdiction in the district court while an appeal is pending is not a per se\nrule. Rather, it is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial economy that is\ndesigned to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues before two\ncourts at the same time.

Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the\ngovernment urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.\n\nWilliam S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United\nStates Atorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by\nthe Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring\nfunds held in and disbursed from <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of\nthe Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court\nand are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and\napprove disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been\nappointed by courts to oversee <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> maters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same\nhourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and\nmonitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the\nproceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> account approved by Judge Duffey.\n\nThe government tries to steer the Court’s atention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack\nof candor to dissuade the Court from considering the proposed monitorship as a meaningful\nrestraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being\nquestioned by Pretrial Services follouing a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol78", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020179.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMent/LVP l Fileasas23F2ig ePagei7l65l8\ndeprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical health and mental well-being, Ms.\nMaxwell responded appropriately and accurately to questions posed by Pretrial Services which\nwere restricted to her personal assets. Since then, <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> documents - collected and\nprofessionally veted by a highly respected accounting firm — have been submited to the\ngovernment and the Court and provide full details and supporting documentation concerning\nMs. Maxwell’s personal assets and those jointly held with the spouse. Further, no valid\nchallenge has been made to those submissions.\n\nThe government challenges the Court by inanely stating that if “the only way to keep\nthe defendant from using her assets to flee is to take away control of her assets, then she is too\ngreat a risk to release.” (Dkt.l65 at 8.) This statement is fundamentally illogical as it\nundermines most conditions of release. For example, the same could be said of electronic\nmonitoring — l.e., if the only way to keep a defendant from fleeing the jurisdiction is to place\nhim on home confinement with electronic monitoring, then he is too great a flight risk to\nrelease.* The Court should readily dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,\nif there are appropriate conditions for release, bail should be granted. The conditions\ncollectively proposed in the previous and present bail applications provide ample assurance that\nMs. Maxwell will be present at trial.\n\n3 Moreover, in an effort to further obfuscate the merits of Ms. Maxwell’s bail application, the government\ndesperately argues that funds for legal services, presently held in atorney escrou accounts, would be\nreleased and made available to support Ms. Maxwell as a fugitive. To suggest that defense counsel would\nbecome accomplices to a violation of a court order shous uter disrespect for Ms. Maxwell’s defense team.\nIn particular, New York counsel, who have spent the entirety of their legal careers practicing in this district\nand establishing well-respected reputations among the bench and bar, take umbrage at the government’s\ncallous assertion.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol79", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020194.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMheht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageBlGhl2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt.

The\nGovernment strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated\nthem. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the\npresumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength\nand nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.\nOp. at 9-lo.\n\nThe Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.\nSee Dec. Op. at lo-l6.

And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor\nregarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court\nemphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the\ninformation presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2o2o and the information\npresented to the Court in December 2o2o raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.\nat l6. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of\nconditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cuting in\nthe opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not\novercome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.\n\nAs aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter\nthe Court’s assessment of the l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to\nfavor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2ol98", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020201.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4ATNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Padgeol d Ob l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020238.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 58-l, o4/l2/2o2l, 3o75763, Page4 of 25\n\nfront of a victim, being present when a minor victim was undressed, and/or being\npresent for sex acts involving a minor victim and Epstein.

Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics.

United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. l6 CR\n54l (CM), 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2ol8). Substantial prejudice is a\nstringent standard. The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”\nUnited States v. Birney, 686 F.2d lo2, lo5-o6 (2d Cir. l982). Actual prejudice “is commonly\ndemonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”\nCornielle, l7l F.3d at 752. But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of\ntime have been held to be insufficient.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *4.

First, she points to documentary evidence absent at trial:\n(l) flight records, including passenger manifests and records from Epstein’s travel agent, that\nmay have been more detailed than the flight logs entered at trial; (2) <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> documents,\nincluding bank records and credit card records, which would have revealed more about the\nDefendant’s receipt of funds from Epstein and could have been used to verify or disprove certain\ndates; (3) a complete set of the Defendant’s phone records; and (4) Epstein’s property records for\nboth his New York and New Mexico residences.

Though the Defendant would herself be best positioned to explain her oun <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ntransactions (or the lack thereof), her brief does not suggest what the absent <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> records\nwould have shoun. Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shoun in\nthe absent phone records. The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were\nmissing. At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September\nll, 2ool, were far less detailed than modern manifests. F.g., Trial Tr. at 25l8-22. The\nDefendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed. The location\nand appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial. The\nDefendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official\nproperty records.\n\nSecond, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the\nDefendant fails to shou why the evidence, if admited at trial, would have benefited her case.\nThe Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her:\nan absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the\nDefendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests.

The leters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who\nwas not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the\nFBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects.\nMoreover, the statement that the mater was “under investigation” was not false because the\ngovernment in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill\nthe terms of the NPA. Houever, the leters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim\nfrustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the\ninvestigation. The leters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies\nresponsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and shoued a lack of atention to and\noversight regarding communication with victims.\n\nAfter the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Atorney the decision\nwhether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to the state’s oun victim’s rights\nrequirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and did not constitute\nprofessional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to\nmake certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal\ninvestigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important\nproceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had\ncommunicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the\nDepartment intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were\nmade aware of a court proceeding that was related to their oun cases, and thus he failed to ensure\nthat victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and\ndiscussions with victims’ atorneys occurring in 2oo8 led to interactions that contributed to\nvictims’ feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them.\n\nAfter examining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victims,\nOPR concludes that the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to\nvictims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the\nmisimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep the NPA secret\nfrom the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The\noverall result of the subjects’ anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims\nfeeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021222.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EAS 3536o38, Page5o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 48 of 348\nalso informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “‘will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\nae Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\na Chapter One, Section II.B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to . . . change anything.”\n\na4 Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2l222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021298.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON l34 3536o38, Pagel26 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l24 of 348\nthe defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7— the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !**\n\nF.

December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafafia\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!°°\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” In a second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> setlements.”\nia The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nlS Villatfafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021325.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON TST 3536o38, Pagel53 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l5l of 348\ncooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM §§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo ef seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seq. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l325", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021342.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 68 3536o38, Pagel7o of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l68 of 348\nOPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.”°? Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.”?’? Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' | The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o8 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\na Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l342", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021355.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ABT 3536o38, Pagel83 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 348\naccept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE, The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl, The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l355", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021359.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON ARS 3536o38, Pagel87 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l85 of 348\n\nThe meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.7°?\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\nane Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\n\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l359", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021369.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON OS 3536o38, Pagel97 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l95 of 348\ninvestigation.”47 Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?*\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\nans See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n24 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l369", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021389.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON IBS 3536o38, Page2l7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 348\nCHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nI.

This chapter sets forth the pertinent legal\nauthorities and Department policies and practices regarding victim notification and consultation,\nas well as OPR’s analysis and conclusions.

A timeline of key events is provided on the follouing page.\n\nI. THE CVRA, l8 U.S.C. § 377l\n\nA, History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>—have gone\nunatended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7°!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n2oo President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n26l See Pub.

The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\nthem.

Sloman noted that the private investigators’ “actions are\ntroublesome because the FBI agents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution of\nthe mater, which includes informing them that, as part of the resolution, Mr. Epstein has agreed\nto pay damages in some circumstances.” The same day, Villafafia emailed Sloman expressing her\nconcern that “if we [file charges] nou, cross-examination will consist of- ‘and the government told\nyou that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are entitled to a large amount of damages, right?””>””\nC. October — November 2oo7: The FBI and the USAO Continue to Investigate,\nand the FBI Sends a Notice Leter to One Victim Stating That the Case is\n“Under Investigation”\nAlthough Villafafia and the FBI case agents decided to stop informing victims about the\nNPA, the FBI continued its investigation of the case, which included locating and interviewing\npotential victims. In October and November 2oo7, the FBI interviewed l2 potential new victims,\n8 of whom had been identified in a “preliminary” victim list in use at the time Epstein signed the\n3o7 Villafafia later emailed Sloman stating that she planned to meet with the case agents to have a “general\ndiscussion about staying out of the civil litigation.”\n3o8 Sloman’s draft also stated that Acosta had informed the defense in a previous conference call that the USAO\nwould not accept a “gag order.” OPR recovered only a draft version of the communication and was unable to find\nany evidence that the draft leter was finalized or sent to defense counsel.\n3o8 Subsequent records also referred to the prosecutors’ concerns about creating impeachment evidence and that\nsuch concerns played a role in their decision not to notify victims of the NPA until after Epstein pled guilty. In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money and we did not want to\ndiscuss liability with them, which was [a] key part of [the] agree[ment].”\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021415.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 34l 3536o38, Page243 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 24l of 348\nin Courtroom llF at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, 2o5 North\nDixie Highway, West Palm Beach, Florida.

Marie and... the agents .. . were keeping the victims apprised at some\nlevel.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7, Villafafia prepared leters containing the above information to be\nsent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.?'°\nSloman, houever, had that day received a leter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing\nwas scheduled for January 4, 2oo8, and requesting that the USAO “hold off” sending the victim\nnotification leters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkouitz\nsubmited to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense\narguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of l8 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman\nresponded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the leter.”?\"” Sloman told\nOPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] leter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia\nwas “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.\nSloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO\n“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification leter... and the deal fell apart, then\nthe victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary\ncompensation.”\n\nOn December lo, 2oo7, Villafafia contacted the atorney who at the time represented the\nvictim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing\nvictim notification leters.” In her 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted\nthat she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered\nAu8 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The leter that is currently being revised\nneeds to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also\nstated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this leter. My\nprimary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”\n\n3l7 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the leters; rather,\nshe “just remember[ed] puting them all in the Redweld and puting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”\n2l5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021478.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ER 3oo 3536o39, Page48 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o2 of 348\nnot plead guilty in October 2oo7 as the USAO expected, it was a “very open question” whether\nthe case would go to trial, and Acosta thought that “where there is no legal requirement|,] [t]here\nhas to be discretion to judge hou much you can tell the victims and when.”\n\nEpstein’s atorneys’ conduct during the period between the signing of the NPA and\nEpstein’s entry of his state guilty pleas illustrated the risk that Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia all\nidentified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.**° In her 2ol7 declaration in\nthe CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that line of questioning as a motivating factor in the\ngovernment’s decision to stop notifying the victims about the potential for l8 U.S.C. § 2255\nrecovery.\n\nOn June 27, 2oo8, the Friday before Epstein’s Monday, June 3o, 2oo8 state court guilty\nplea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about that upcoming hearing. Villafafia\ntold OPR she ‘“‘was not given authorization to contact” any victim’s atorney other than Edwards\nabout the scheduled state plea hearing.**° In his 2ol7 affidavit prepared for the CVRA litigation,\nEdwards stated that Villafafia “gave the impression that she was caught off-guard herself that\nEpstein was pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”\n\nEdwards said in a 2ol6 court filing that Villafafia told him only that “Epstein was pleading\nguilty to state solicitation of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edward’s\nclients nor any of the federally-identified victims.” Villafafia stated in her 2ol7 declaration that\nshe “never told Atorney Edwards that the state charges involved ‘other victims,’ and neither the\nstate court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement of prostitution\ncharge to a specific victim.” Villafafia told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] and his\nclients to atend” the plea hearing but “could not be more explicit” because she was not “authorized\nby the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” In his 2ol7 affidavit, Edwards acknouledged\nthat “Villafafia did express that this hearing was important, but never told me why she felt that\nway.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to inform him that the “guilty pleas in state court\nwould bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”\nresulted in his clients not atending the hearing.

For example, in a March 2oo8 email, Villafafia informed her managers that she spoke to a victim who\nhad received a subpoena “issued in connection with the state criminal case, which, as you knou, doesn’t involve most\nof the victims in our case (including the girl who was subpoenaed).” Villafafia further observed that because Epstein\nis “going to plead to the solicitation of adults for prostitution charge [in state court], [the act of subpoenaing the victim]\nseems to be a clear effort to find out about our case through the state case.”\n\n436 Villafafia’s June 3o, 2oo8 handwriten notes reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state court guilty plea,\nVillafafia was aware of the identities of a least five other atorneys representing Epstein’s victims. In her writen\nresponse to OPR, Villafafia stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the\nupcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,\nand Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.” On Saturday, June 28, 2oo8, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform\nhim that PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.” Sloman replied, “Good.”\n\n276\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l478", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021488.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OR 3l) 3536o39, Pageds of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l2 of 348\n\nOPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA\nafter it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and\nconversations with victims’ atorneys in 2oo8 do not constitute professional misconduct.\nContemporaneous records shou that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating\nimpeachment evidence that Epstein’s victims had <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> motives to make claims against him,\nevidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing\nvictims.

May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o56", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023060.jpg": "also informed Sloman and Lourie that the FBI was re-interviewing victims who had given taped\nstatements to the PBPD, to ensure their stories “have not changed,” and that “[a]ny discrepancies\nwill be noted and considered.” She conceded that “[g]eting them to tell their stories in front of a\njury at trial may be much harder,” but expressed confidence that the two key victims “will stay the\ncourse.” She acknouledged that the case “needs to be rock solid.”\n\nThe case agent told OPR that in this initial stage of the investigation, the FBI “partnered\nup very well” with the USAO. She recalled that there was litle higher-level management oversight\neither from the FBI or the USAO, and “we were alloued to do what we needed to do to get our\njob done.” This included continuing to identify, locate, and interview victims and Epstein\nemployees, and obtaining records relating to Epstein’s travel, communications, and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>\ntransactions. The case agent viewed the case as “strong.”\n\n5. October 2oo6 — February 2oo7: Epstein’s Defense Counsel Initiate\nContact with Villafaia, Lourie, and Sloman, and Press for a Meeting\n\nJust as Epstein had learned of the PBPD investigation at its early stage, he quickly became\naware of the federal investigation, both because the FBI was interviewing his employees and\nbecause the government was seeking records from his businesses. One of Epstein’s New York\natorneys, Gerald Lefcourt, made initial contact with Villafafia in August 2oo6. As the\ninvestigation progressed, Epstein took steps to persuade the USAO to decline federal\nprosecution.*” As with the state investigation, Epstein employed atorneys who had experience\nwith the Department and relationships with individual USAO personnel.*? One of Epstein’s\nMiami lawyers, Guy Lewis, a former career AUSA and U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida, made an overture on Epstein’s behalf in early November 2oo6.** Lewis telephoned\nVillafafia, a call that Sloman joined at Villafafia’s request. Lewis offered to provide Villafafia\n2 Villafafia told OPR that Epstein’s lawyers wanted to stop the investigation “prematurely.”\n\n43 Chapter One, Section III-B of this Report identifies several of the atorneys knoun to have represented\nEpstein in connection with the federal investigation, along with a brief summary of their connections to the\nDepartment, the USAO, or individuals involved in the investigation. At least one former AUSA also represented\nduring civil depositions individuals associated with Epstein. Menchel told OPR that he and his colleagues recognized\nEpstein was selecting atorneys based on their perceived influence within the USAO, and they viewed this tactic as\n“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.” Menchel told OPR, “[O]ur perspective was this is not going to .. . change anything.”\n\na Lewis served in the USAO for over lo years, and was U.S. Atorney from 2ooo to 2oo2. He then served for\ntwo years as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Atorneys, the Department’s administrative office serving the\nUSS. Atorneys.\n\nEarly in the investigation, Lourie voluntarily notified the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer that\nLourie was friends with Lewis and also had a close friendship with Lewis’s law partner, who also was a former AUSA\nand also represented Epstein. Lourie requested guidance as to whether his relationships with Lewis and Lewis’s law\npartner created either a conflict of interest or an appearance of impropriety mandating recusal. The Professional\nResponsibility Officer responded that Lourie’s relationships with the two men were not “covered” relationships under\nthe conflict of interest guidelines but deferred to Sloman or Menchel “to make the call.” Thereafter, Sloman authorized\nLourie to continue supervising the case. During his OPR interview, Lourie asserted that his personal connection to\nLewis did not influence his handling of the case.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23o6o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023136.jpg": "the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of\nunwinding the agreement.”\n\nOn December 7, 2oo7—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2oo7 leter to Starr—\nthe defense transmited to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,\nsigned by Epstein. !*4\n\nF. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It\n\nand Accuse Villafania of Improper Conduct\n\nl. December 7 and ll, 2oo7: Starr and Lefkouitz Send to Acosta Leters\nand “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation\nand Villafana\n\nOn the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr\nand Lefkouitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions’”—one authored by prominent\ncriminal defense atorney and former U.S. Atorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported\nimproprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal\njudge and former U.S. Atorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery\nprovision under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”\n\nDays later, on December ll, 2oo7, Starr sent a leter to Acosta transmiting two lengthy\nsubmissions authored by Lefkouitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the\n“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously\nraised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 2o pages long, Lefkouitz\naddressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized\nVillafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented\nfederal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State\nAtorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are\nsignificantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead\nguilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*\n\nLefkouitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that\nwas “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and\ninterview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed\ninformation that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkouitz criticized federal\ninvolvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,\nl3-page submission, Lefkouitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the\nNPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of\nhelping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> setlements.”\n\nl8 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and\nAddendum to same dated October 3o, 2oo7.”\nl5 Villafafia sent Lefkouitz a five-page leter responding to the accusations made against her personally.\n98\nDOJ-OGR- ooo23l36", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023163.jpg": "cooperation as part of a plea agreement, or compelling cooperation under a “use immunity” order.\nThe comment observes that these alternative means “are clearly preferable to permiting an\noffender to avoid any liability for his/her conduct” and “should be given serious consideration in\nthe first instance.” USAM 8§ 9-27.62o and 9-27.63o set forth considerations a prosecutor should\ntake into account when entering into a non-prosecution agreement. Generally, the U.S. Atorney\nhas authority to approve a non-prosecution agreement. USAM § 9-27.6oo comment. Houever,\nUSAM § 9-27.64o directs that a government atorney should not enter into a non-prosecution\nagreement in exchange for a person’s cooperation without first obtaining the approval of the\nappropriate Assistant Atorney General, or his or her designee, when the person is someone who\n“is likely to become of major public interest.”\nThese USAM provisions do not address the uses of non-prosecution agreements in\ncircumstances other than when needed to obtain cooperation.\n5. USAM Provisions Relating to Grants of Immunity\nNothing in the USAM directly prohibits the government from using the criminal exposure\nof third parties in negotiating with a criminal defendant. Instead, the provision that addresses\nimmunity relates only to the exchange of limited immunity for the testimony of a witness who has\nasserted a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. See USAM 8§ 9-23.loo et seq.\n6. USAM/C.F.R. Provisions Relating to <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Conflicts of Interest\nDepartment employees are expected to be aware of, and to comply with, all ethics-related\nlaws, rules, regulations, and policies. See, generally, USAM § l-4.ooo et seg. Specifically, a\ngovernment atorney is prohibited by criminal statute from participating personally and\nsubstantially in any particular mater in which he has a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> interest or in which such an\ninterest can be imputed to him. See l8 U.S.C. § 2o8 and 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.4ol-4o2. In addition,\na Department employee should seek advice from an ethics official before participating in any\nmater in which his impartiality could be questioned. If a conflict of interest exists, in order for\nthe employee to participate in the mater, the head of the employee’s component, with the\nconcurrence of an ethics official, must make a determination that the interest of the government in\nthe employee’s participation outweighs the concern that a reasonable person may question the\nintegrity of the Department’s programs and operations. The determination must be made in\nwriting. See 5 C.F.R. §§ 2635.5ol-5o2.\nB. Other Department Policies\nl. Department Policies Relating to the Disposition of Charges\nThe Atorney General has the responsibility for establishing prosecutorial priorities for the\nDepartment. Over the span of several decades, each successive Atorney General has articulated\nthose priorities in policy memoranda issued to all federal prosecutors. As applicable here, on\nSeptember 22, 2oo3, Atorney General John Ashcroft issued a memorandum regarding\n“Department Policy Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition of Charges, and\nSentencing” (Ashcroft Memo). The Ashcroft Memo, which explicitly superseded all previous\nDepartmental guidance on the subject, set forth policies “designed to ensure that all federal\nl25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023180.jpg": "OPR was atentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or\nother illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.” Witnesses,\nincluding law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information\nindicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same\nwitnesses of the Epstein mater’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had\nperceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case\nagent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they\nwere unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the mater because of illegal factors such\nas a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately\nhave been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.\nB. Contemporaneous Writen Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did\nNot Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly\nInfluenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations\nAlthough Epstein’s name is nou nationally recognized, in 2oo6 and 2oo7, he was not a\nfamiliar national figure or even particularly well knoun in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that\nwhen they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case\nagent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of\nEpstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.\nHouever, news reports about Epstein’s July 2oo6 arrest on the state indictment, which were\ncontemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm\nBeach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,\nand Alan Dershouitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,\nLourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus\nunderstood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case\nagent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his\nconnections.”\nl. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing\nThat the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors\nOPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the\nterms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential\nconnections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> status in arguing for a sentence\nthat did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,\nbut the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned\nformer President Clinton in one pre-NPA leter, but that reference was made in the context of a\n2o2 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found\nindication of criminal activity, it would have referred the mater to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.\n2lo Larry Keller, “Billionaire solicited prostitutes three times, indictment says,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6;\nNicole Janok, “Consultant to the rich indicted, jailed,” Palm Beach Post, July 24, 2oo6.\naul Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial\nprosecution memorandum.\nl42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l8o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023193.jpg": "accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of\nhome confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and\ndid not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of\nprobation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail\nsentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early\nstages of the negotiations.\n\nAs discussed belou, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-\nyear offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the\nreasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to\nany other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of\nand approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.\nThe only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of\nMenchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the\npurported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly\ndisputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his\nunderstanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember litle about the critical\nconversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.\nGiven the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence shouing Epstein’s vigorous\nresistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in\nVillafafia’s 2ol8 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of\nEpstein’s atorneys.\n\nE. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense\n\nCounsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein\n\nOPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with\ndefense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the\nNPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism\ntouard or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.\n\nl. The Evidence Shous That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with\nEpstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations\n\nAlthough pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving\n<span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent\nin sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s\natorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s\nview, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those\nmeetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 3l, 2oo7 “term\nsheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”\n\nOPR’s investigation established that while the defense atorneys persistently contacted the\nsubjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings\nactually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the mater. As shoun in the chart on the\nfollouing page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,\nthe subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—\n\nl55\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023197.jpg": "The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s defense atorneys, together with the\nState Atorney and the lead state prosecutor on September l2, 2oo7, was a necessary part of the\nNPA negotiation process.\n\nEven after the NPA was signed, the defense continued to request meetings and reviews of\nthe case, both within the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal Division and the Deputy\nAtorney General. Although limited reviews were granted, during this period there was only one\nsubstantive meeting with Acosta, on December l4, 2oo7.7°? This meeting occurred in lieu of the\nmeeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atorney General Fisher, most likely because the defense\nsubmissions to the Department’s Criminal Division had raised issues not previously raised with\nthe USAO and the Department determined that Acosta should address those in the first instance.”*°\nAcosta told OPR that he did not ask for the Department review, but he also did not want to appear\nas if he “fear[ed]” that review. Acosta’s nuanced position, houever, was not clear to the\nDepartment atorneys who responded to Epstein’s appeals and who perceived Acosta to be in favor\nof a Department review, rather than merely tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those meetings\nor reviews resulted in the USAO abandoning the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial\nadvantage from his continued entreaties.\n\nIn sum, in evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered the number of meetings, their\npurpose, the content of the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR cannot say that the\nnumber of meetings, particularly those occurring before the NPA was signed, was so far outside\nthe norm—for a high profile case with skilled defense atorneys—that the quantity of meetings\nalone shous that the subjects were motivated by improper favoritism. In evaluating the subjects’\nconduct, OPR considered that the meetings were held with different levels of USAO managers and\nthat the explanations for the decisions to participate in the meetings reflected reasonable strategic\ngoals. Although OPR cannot rule out the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or\nSloman knew or knew of the defense atorneys, they may have been willing to meet with them, it\nis also true that prosecutors routinely meet with defense atorneys, including those who are knoun\nto them and those who are not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile\ncases involving defendants with the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources to hire skilled defense counsel who request\nmeetings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR did not\nfind evidence supporting a conclusion that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial\nbenefit to the defense. At each meeting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,\nlegal, and policy grounds—to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mater to the state to\nproceed as it saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find\nevidence supporting a conclusion that Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia met with\ndefense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the meetings themselves caused\nAcosta or the other subjects to provide improper benefits to Epstein.\n\n232 Acosta’s October l2, 2oo7 breakfast meeting with Lefkouitz is discussed separately in the follouing section.\n233 Starr and other defense atorneys only obtained one meeting at the Department level, with Deputy Assistant\nAtorney General Mandelker and CEOS Chief Oosterban in March 2oo8. Although Starr requested a meeting with\nAssistant Atorney General Fisher and another with Deputy Atorney General Filip, those requests were not granted.\nl59\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23l97", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023207.jpg": "investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2oo9 suggested Epstein was released from his state\nincarceration “early” because he was assisting in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> crimes investigation in the Eastern\nDistrict of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia\nwas notified by the AUSAs handling the mater that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was\nproviding “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2oll, Villafafia reported to senior\ncolleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of\nit is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New\nYork was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein\ncooperating in a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an\n“intelligence asset.”?4\n\nIn addition to the contemporaneous record atesting that Epstein was not a cooperating\nwitness in a federal mater, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating\nwitness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s\ninvestigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a\nbasis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion\nthat he had assisted in a different mater, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense\ncounsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have\nomited any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.\n\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided\nEpstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal\ninvestigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for\ncooperation in any mater.\n\nV. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL\n\nINVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA\n\nAlthough OPR finds that none of the subjects commited professional misconduct in this\nmater, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal\ninvestigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case\nand his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the\nfederal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to\nmanipulate the conditions of his sentence to his oun advantage. The NPA relied on state\nauthorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over\nthe process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,\nsuch as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release\nand mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising\nnot to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with litle discussion or consideration\nby the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a\n243 See, e.g., Julie K. Broun, “Perversion of Justice: Hou a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex\nabuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2ol8.\n\n244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2ol9 press conference, in answering a\nmedia question about whether he had knouledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that\n“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified seting to discuss intelligence information.\nl69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo232o7", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00023227.jpg": "CHAPTER THREE\nISSUES RELATING TO THE GOVERNMENT?’S INTERACTIONS\nAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH VICTIMS\nPART ONE: FACTUAL BACKGROUND\nl.

History\n\nIn December l982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report\noutlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime\nvictims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice\nhave gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>—have gone\nunatended.””©° Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the\ncriminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of l982, the Victims of Crime Act\nof l984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of l99o (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and\nLaw Enforcement Act of l994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of l996, the\nVictim Rights Clarification Act of l997, and the Justice for All Act of 2oo4.7!\n\nThe CVRA, enacted on October 3o, 2oo4, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed\nto protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.””°” The\nCVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional\namendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’\n76o President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at i (Dec. l982).\n\n76l See Pub.

The draft response, as revised\nby Acosta, stated:\n\nYou should understand, houever, that there are some\n\ncommunications that are typical in these maters. As an example,\n\nour Office has an obligation to contact the victims to inform them\n\nthat either [the Special Master], or his designee, will be contact[ing]\n\nthem.

In August\n2oo8, the AUSA handling the CVRA litigation emailed Villafafia, Acosta, and Sloman expressing his understanding\nthat the “victims were not consulted [concerning the NPA]... because [the USAO] did not believe the [CVRA]\napplied.” Acosta responded: “As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as\npotential witnesses.

As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court criminal charges and\ncivil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that the victims were motivated to testify against\nEpstein by the government’s promises of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> gain. For example, during a February 2o, 2oo8\nstate deposition of a victim, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosecutors or FBI\nagents told her that she was entitled to receive money from Epstein.

On July 2, 2ol9, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for\nthe Southern District of New York returned an indictment that charged Epstein with engaging in sex\ntrafficking and a sex trafficking conspiracy, in violation of l8 U.S.C. 88 37l, l59l(a), (b)(2), and 2. These\ncharges were based on allegations that between 2oo2 and 2oo5, Epstein paid girls as young as l4 years old\nhundreds of dollars in cash each for engaging in sex acts with him at his Florida and New York residences.\nThe indictment further alleged that Epstein also paid each of these minor victims hundreds of dollars in cash\nto recruit other girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein.\nOn July 6, 2ol9, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey upon his return to the United States\nfrom France and was transported to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) Metropolitan Correctional Center,\nlocated at l5o Park Rou in New York, New York (MCC New York). Follouing a detention hearing on July l5,\n2ol9, the court ordered that Epstein be detained pending trial based on the court's finding that he was a\ndanger to the community and a flight risk.\nMCC New York is a federal administrative detention facility operated by the BOP that primarily provides\npretrial detention services for the U.S. District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\nThe BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are\nunrelated to this investigation.

MCC New York has several different housing units. Epstein was initially assigned to MCC\nNew York’s general inmate population, but on July 7, 2ol9, he was moved to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)\npending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness of his notoriety\namong the other inmates.

Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly\nmade Epstein his <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no\nfootman: he loved luxury and, in his oun words, saw himself as a <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> architect, someone who\ncould shou the rich hou to live with their money. “I want people to understand the pouer, the\nresponsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his pouers seemed magical. “I\nthink it’s all done with mirrors,” says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and\nlost) when an oil deal didn’t work out.\nNext: Epstein's Icarus moment.\na iS, EAS we Be) ee\npad... es, oy ek A ee ae\nBo RT Ae\nfm Fae 2 ee in:\na4 fo fey ok ‘Gyan ss ty a Wal\n. * ae a Bp 2 se\n* WE eee alsa 5 + id «pS — — _ r Pe \"\nThe New York Times\nRedux)\nStroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. “Everybody who’s his friend thinks he’s so\ndarn brilliant because he’s so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, | never saw him work. Anybody |\nknou that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day.”\nThose who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. “His mind\ngoes through a cross section of descriptions,” says Joe Pagano, a financier. “He can go from\nmathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct\nanswer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”\nA Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to\nmake connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is\nextremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also\nto identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an\nextremely short atention span. Why?— it’s not that he’s bored.

And even to doubt an expert’s\nstatements.”\nEpstein has been a munificent supporter of cuting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early\nbiotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the\nlate nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference\non the West Coast in his beautiful 727.\n“Tt was all a litle giddy,” Wolff says. “There’s a litle food out, lovely hors d’ oeuvre. And then after\nfifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he\nhad a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual atire. Jeans, no socks,\nloafers, a buton-doun shirt, shirtails out. And he was folloued onto the plane by—hou shall I say\n\n| this?—by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, l8, l9, 2o, who\nknous? They were model-like. They touered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things.\nYou didn’t knou what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very\ntall girls?”\nSoon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7lst Street. He understood that there was a\npurpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it7” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old—old-fashioned, unrehabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say ‘What’s\ngoing on here?” and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling are of Epstein’s comet came to an end—without his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter bad been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary -admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe schoo] with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl left school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and Jotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came in,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhi 28ieaw vrinthis clickahility cam /nt/ent?aieeSF oft D2 tlo=The+t Panta iPulie Reberds Reqdest N6./l7-295°°\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3l4o5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031524.jpg": "APR-84-2o86 l2:27 FROM: TO:385 223 7345 P.4728\n) i\n4 cocencare fl xc in the Palm Beach Gardens\noffice of Mortgage Express as a mortgage broker.\n3.

Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Uber-way. “What does the\nmedia mean, where does he fit into it?” Then Epstein began to shou up in the press. In 2oo2, he flew\nBill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being\nwriten about. In 2oo3, he becarne a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was\ninvolved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> architect in his\noffice at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. “His\nliteral office is where Bennet Cerf’s was. It’s an incredibly strange place. It has no corporate affect at\nall. It’s almost European. It’s old-—-old-fashioned, unrebabbed in its way.” Nearby, Wolff went on, “the\ntrading floor is filled with guys in yarmulkes. Who they are, I have no idea. They’re like a throuback, a\nbunch of guys from the fifties. So here is Jeffrey in this incredibly beautiful office, with pieces of art and\na view of the courtyard, and he seems like the most relaxed guy in the world. You want to say “What’s\ngoing on here?’ and he gives you that Cheshire smile.”\nEpstein likes to say he’s private, but you don’t fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting atention. One\nfriend says the Africa trip was Epstein’s Icarus moment. There was tremendous risk that the natural\nforces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends’ theory\nof the Palm Beach case: an overzealous police chief batened onto a rich man because he was not living\nin a box like everyone else.\nThe dazzling arc of Epstein’s comet came to an end—vwithout his knouing it—in March 2oo5. That was\nwhen a distraught woman called the police in Palm Beach and, after at first refusing to give her name,\nsaid that she believed her l4-year-old stepdaughter had been molested by a wealthy man. The\nstepmother had learned about the mater in a roundabout way. The girl lived during the week at an\n“involuntary-admited juvenile educational facility” because of behavior problems. She had shoun up at\nthe school with $3oo in her purse, and it became the talk of her classmates. One friend called the girl a\n“whore,” another friend put a fist through the wall in anger, the girl lefi school. The stepmother got a\ncall from another student’s mother. Soon, a policewoman was talking to the girl with a therapist present.\nThe girl cried and dug her finger into her thigh and told the story, of going to a big house on the Atlantic\nIntracoastal Waterway, and climbing a spiral staircase to the master bedroom, where a blonde woman of\n25 who wasn’t very friendly laid out sheets and lotions on a massage table and left, then Jeff came m,\nnaked but for a touel, and sternly ordered the girl to take off her clothes. As she rubbed his chest, he\ntouched himself, then applied a vibrator to her crotch.\nhtn-/Awww nrinthis clickahilitv com/nt/ent?acton=cnt &title=The+Fantasist&exnire=acurl... l/l3/2oo8\no7/26/l7 Page 24 of l5l Public Records Request No.: l7-295\nDOJ-OGR-ooo32o63", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00032072.jpg": "_ i. _ eee\npersonality Donald Trump—sometimes hea es ; i\nseem not all that clear as to what he ac- { Peta Ss : a ~\ntually does to earn his millions.

Children in\nhis classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of\nwealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been\nexposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and\nuniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As\nmaters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-\naltering on a number of different jevels.\nAs Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to atend an art\ngallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached\nby a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially\ntalented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working\non Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even knou where Wall Street\n° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.\nDuring his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admited that he did not\nknou what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea\nchange in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively\nbased valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a\njob on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.\nJeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,\nand came to knou a number of successful investors. His success in the position is\nreflected in the fact that by l98o he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.\nBelieving, houever, that he could do beter on his oun on the outside, he decided to\nresign from Bear Stearns in l98l. Capitalizing on his knouledge of and experience\ninvesting in esoteric <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to\n; the unique family and <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience\n| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &\n\nCompany (nou <span class=\"highlight\">Financial</span> Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the\n\n“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> advice (on\n\ninvestment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the\n\n2\n| Public Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033231.jpg": "Generosity to Employees and Others. While it might be commonplace to say that\na particular business person treats his employees as family, Jeffrey’s history clearly\nreflects this fact on both <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> and emotional levels. Jeffrey is a wealthy man who is\nquick to share his largesse. But he is also a man who engages personally and emotionally\nthose who work for him and those he knous. Once he learns of and determines through\nconversation a need or an aspiration of an employee, he explores this with the employee,\ntreats it in almost mathematical terms as a problem in search of a solution, and then sees\nto it that, without strings atached, the solution happens. The issues may be\naccommodations that an employee needs to address pressing personal or family\nproblems; tuition payments that an employee or employee family member needs to beter\nhimself or herself; or assistance, both <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> and professional, an employee needs to\naddress the vexing and often tragic problems that life presents human beings. In this\ncapacity, he is a benefactor but quite often also a mentor.\n\nExamples abound. One particularly poignant one was recounted by Darren K.\nIndyke, general counsel to Jeffrey:\n\n; Two years ago, a building workman approached Jeffrey with news that the\nworkman's wife needed a kidney transplant and that the workman’s sister-\nin-law was a willing donor. Unfortunately, the sister-in-law was a citizen\nof Colombia and the workman did not have the <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> resources or\nknou hou to get the sister-in-law into the country for the surgery. Jeffrey\narranged for immigration counsel to expedite a visa for the sister-in-law\nand sponsored and purchased the plane tickets for the sister-in-law’s visit\nto the United States. The surgery was a success and both patients\nrecovered completely. The sister-in-law flew back to Colombia at Mr.\nEpstein’s expense. Last year, the workman and his wife celebrated the\nhigh school graduation of their oldest daughter, whose college education\nis nou being funded by Mr. Epstein.\n\nThere have been many instances of accommodations Jeffrey has made for\nemployees so that they could address significant issues of their personal lives. Several\nexamples follou:\n\nA father of one of Jeffrey’s employees in the Virgin Islands was recently\ndiagnosed with cancer. Jeffrey is personally paying the medical bills for\nthe father’s treatment and has given the employee <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span> support and\ncomplete flexibility to take time off from work whenever required in order\nto fly to Florida to atend to the employee’s father.\n\nll\n\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo3323l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00033234.jpg": "different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally\nasked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a\nmoment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the\nbills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his\ngenerosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing\nnews.\nIn the days and weeks that folloued, Jeffrey personally researched\ninfertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He\nidentified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were\nseeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the\nprogress of our treatment cycle.\nUnfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I\nwere hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at\nhis expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be\nterminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were\ndevastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as <span class=\"highlight\">financial</span>,\nsupport and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and\nmy wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me\n. to go over my wife’s and my options, which nou included in-vitro\nfertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not\nblink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we\n, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private\nadoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,\nwhile we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.\nAt the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption\n. atempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to\ncontinue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we\nwould not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,\nto meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas\nadoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after\nour fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters, Although\nJeffrey was adamant that we oued him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by\nagreeing to be the godfather of our children.\n\nThe botom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably\nsuccessfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous\nhuman being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but\nhas been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,\neducational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,\n\nand civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them\nl4\nPublic Records Request No. l9-372\nDOJ-OGR-ooo33234"};
