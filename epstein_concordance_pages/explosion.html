Ms. Maxwell is Devoted to Her Spouse | and Would\nNever Destroy Her Family By Leaving the Country\n\nThe leter submited by Ms. Maxwell’s spouse pouerfully demonstrates that Ms.\nMaxwell has deep roots in the United States and is not a flight risk. The leter describes Ms.\nMaxwell’s domestic life with her spouse ie in the\nfour years prior to her arrest. Her spouse describes Ms. Maxwell as a “wonderful and loving\nperson,” who ls does not remotely resemble\nthe person depicted in the indictment. (Ex. A § 4). Contrary to the government’s assertion\nthat Ms. Maxwell lived a rootless, “transient” lifestyle (Dkt. 4 at 9), Ms. Maxwell lived a\nquiet family life with her spouse | until\nEpstein’s arrest in July 2ol9 ignited a media frenzy that has ripped the family apart.\n\nThe person described in the criminal charges is not the person we knou.

(BP) that killed l5 people and injured more than\nl7o. Before bringing criminal charges, the government negotiated a guilty plea with BP without\nnotifying the victims. The government filed a sealed motion, alerting the district court to the\npotential plea and claiming that consultation with all the victims was impractical and that such\nnotification could result in media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court\nthen entered an order prohibiting the government from notifying the victims of the pending plea\nagreement until after it had been signed by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal\ninformation, the government and BP signed the plea agreement, and the government mailed notices\nof the plea hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. One month later, l2\nvictims asked the court to reject the plea because it was entered into in violation of their rights\nunder the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to\nconfer with the prosecutor in the case and to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim’s\ndignity and privacy vested prior to the initiation of charges.*#° The district court noted that the\nlegislative history reflected a view that “the right to confer was intended to be broad,” as well as\nbeing a “mechanism[]” to ensure that victims were treated with fairness.\n\nIn denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the district court\n“failed to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA.”**° In particular, the Fifth Circuit\ncited the district court’s acknouledgement that “[t]here are clearly rights under the CVRA that\napply before any prosecution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that such consultation\nwas not “an infringement” on the government’s independent prosecutorial discretion, but “it is\nonly a requirement that the government confer in some reasonable way with the victims before\nultimately exercising its broad discretion.” In the wake of the Dean opinion, two Department\ncomponents wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning\nwhether the CVRA right to confer with the prosecution vests prior to the initiation of a prosecution.\nIX. JUNE 2oo8: VILLAFANA’S PRE-PLEA CONTACTS WITH THE ATTORNEY\n\nREPRESENTING THE VICTIMS WHO LATER BECAME THE CVRA\n\nPETITIONERS\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in the CVRA litigation by her atorney, Bradley Edwards,\nWild retained Edwards in June 2oo8 to represent her “because she was unable to get anyone from\nthe [USAO] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey\nEpstein.”347 Villafafia told OPR that Wild did not contact her directly and she was not aware of\n344 In re Dean, 527 F.3d 39l (Sth Cir. 2oo8).
