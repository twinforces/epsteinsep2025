See generally United States v. Marion, 4o4 U.S. 3o7 (l97l).\nHere, the delays of l4 years from the last alleged act and l2 years since Mr. Epstein signed the\nNPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct that the NPA does not, and never did,\npreclude a prosecution in this district, then the government will have to explain why it\npurposefully delayed a prosecution of someone like Mr. Epstein, who registered as a sex\noffender lo years ago and was certainly no stranger to law enforcement. There is no legitimate\nexplanation for the delay.\nIl. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\n\nconditions will assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety\n\nAn analysis of the relevant statutory factors and case law supports pretrial release. Even\nshould the Court conclude, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, that the defendant\npresents a risk of flight, the foregoing <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions virtually guarantees his\nappearance as required. Crucially, while it is always possible to hypothesize risks, the statutory\nstandard requires only a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The\nconditions proposed above, including electronic GPS monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s\npassport, deregistration and/or grounding of Mr. Epstein’s private plane, and a substantial\npersonal bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet as security to\nguarantee appearance) would extinguish any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoriety\nminimizes any conceivable risk of flight even further. The location where he could be detained —\nhis residence on East 7l‘ Street in New York has entrances (one on the street, one in the back)\nthat can be easily monitored by video. With all of his financial resources in the United States\n(other than his Paris residence) and with his New York residence at risk due to the government’s\nforfeiture allegation, Mr. Epstein would be sacrificing virtually everything he has worked for —\nincluding any collateral the Court requires he post to secure his appearance — if he were to flee\nand to disentitle himself to the defense of his property whether it would be at risk to forfeiture or\nfor a bail violation.\n\nTo the extent there is any doubt regarding the proposed conditions, there is tremendous\nmoral suasion provided by the posting of real and personal property of Mr. Epstein’s brother, and\nhis close personal friend of decades, who have offered to co-sign a surety bond to ensure Mr.\nEpstein’s appearance in Court as required. Indeed, Mr. Epstein’s brother has agreed to pledge\nhis family home, that he shares half the year with his l4-year-old daughter and l7-year-old son,\nin order to secure the bond. It is particularly telling that Mr. Epstein’s brother, his only living\nimmediate family member, as well as his close personal friend, are both willing to guarantee his\nappearance, notwithstanding the widespread negative publicity of Mr. Epstein that has\ndominated the news cycle since his arrest.\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo282", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000288.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page l5 of l6\nIV. Sixth Amendment\nFinally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is\npredicated on events allegedly occurring l4 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to\nprovide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his\ndefense, that Mr. Epstein be permited pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide\nmerely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right\nto make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and\ncause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who\nmust be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Fareta v.\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 8o6, 8l9 (l975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.\nEpstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his\npretrial detention.\nV. Conclusion\nWherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct\nover the past l4 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the\ncommunity. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the\nsafety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed\nsupra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.\nYours truly,\nReid Weingarten\nSteptoe & Johnson, LLP (NYC)\nll4 Avenue of the Americas\nNew York, NY loo36\n(2o2)-5o6-39oo\nFax: (2l2)-5o6-395o\nrweingarten@steptoe.com\nMartin G.

Rather than even atempting to address the grave risks\nof releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,\nthe defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to litle more than a barely-secured\nbond masquerading as a l4-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and\norder him detained pending trial.\n\nAmong other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the\nprincipal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to\nforfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His\nproposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be litle\ncomfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to\nthis country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given\nhis wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only\nfurther highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the\nDistrict. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—\nand does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has\ncontinued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he\nproposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar\ncircumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he\ncan be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.\n\nThe defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended\ndetention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions\nshort of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably\nprotect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the\n“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title l8, United States Code Section l5l9,\nand conspiracy to commit the same.\n\nAs charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long\nscheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens\nof minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in\ncash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the\ndefendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual\nin nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect\ncontact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant\nactively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He\npaid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,\ncreating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo33o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000338.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll _ Filed o7/l2/l9 Page lo of l4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Valerio, 9\nF. Supp. 3d at 295).\n\nTl. The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a\nRisk to Obstruct Justice\n\nA. Danger to the Community\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant’s argument that l4 years without a criminal conviction\neliminates “any danger presumption” should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly\nis not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption\napplicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.\nArtis, 6o7 F. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2ol5) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record was\n“not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court’s\ndetermination that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against\ndangerousness and the risk of flight”). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal\nrecord, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor.\n\nBut the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further\ndemonstrated by the defendant’s maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies\nof his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through\nits search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant’s\nresidence included those with hand-writen labels including the follouing: “Young [Name] +\n[Name],” “Misc nudes l,” and “Girl pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government has found that\nsuch discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude\nfemales appearing to be underage.\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo338", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000343.jpg": "_ Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documentll-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page l of lo\n.)

Jeffrey Epstein, l9 Cr. 49o (RMB)\n\nDear Judge Pitman:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled\nfor July 8, 2ol9, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should\norder that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\n\nAs set forth belou, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is\nalleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years,\nand he nou faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted\nevidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the substantial\nincarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of\nflight, particularly given the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ounership of and access to private\nplanes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of\nthe defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned\nfrom a multi-week stay abroad.\n\nFinally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past\nexperience with this defendant—that if alloued to remain out on bail, the defendant could atempt\nto pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and\ntheir families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger\nto the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight.\nThe defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this\ncase, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo343", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000346.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page4oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 4\nARGUMENT\nI. Applicable Law\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a\ndanger to the community or a risk of flight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e) (“no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. l987);\nUnited States v. Chimurenga, 76o F.2d 4oo, 4o5 (2d Cir. l985). A finding of dangerousness must\nbe supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 54o,\n542 (2d Cir. l995); Chimurenga, 76o F.2d at 4o5. In addition, a court may also order detention if\nthere is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . atempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,\ninjure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2)(B); see also United\nStates v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (l) the\nnature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;\n(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]\nfinancial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is\nentitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2);\nsee also United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3o-3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (government entitled\nto proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.\nMartir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll45 (2d Cir. l986) (same).\n\nWhere a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before\ntrial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with\ncommiting an offense involving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it shall be presumed,\nsubject to rebutal, that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(E).\n\nII. Discussion\n\nThe defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth belou, it is\ndifficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,\nand for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of\ndetention in this case.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo346", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000347.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page5oflo\nHonorable Henry Pitman\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nJuly 8, 2ol9\nPage 5\nA. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk\n\nEach of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances\nof the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —\ncounsel strongly in favor of detention.\n\nl. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense plainly favor detention. l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a\ndefendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the\ncommunity. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant’s\nconduct was commited serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims.\n\nThe seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which\ninclude up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.’ As the Second\nCircuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of\nflight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l8 (loth Cir.\n2oo3) (defendant was a flight risk because her knouledge of the seriousness of the charges against her\ngave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Tounsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. l99o)\n(“Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even\ngreater incentive to consider flight.”). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades\nin prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail belou, the defendant has\nin abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.\nIt is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real\nprospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted.\n\nThe likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is butressed by the strength of the\nevidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges\nthat the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists\nnumerous overt acts commited in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes.*\n> The current penalties for violations of l8 U.S.C. § l59l include a lo year mandatory minimum\nsentence. Houever, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2oo6.\nThe penalty for a violation of Section l59l during the period charged in the Indictment, and\ntherefore relevant here, was a maximum of 4o years’ imprisonment.\n\n4 With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the\n\nIndictment is sufficient, on its oun, to establish probable cause that the defendant commited the\n\ncrimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were an\n\nevidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3l42(e) case in\n\nwhich an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering\n\nthat which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo347", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000350.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Documenti-l Filed o7/l2/l9 Page8oflo\n\nHonorable Henry Pitman\n\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\nJuly 8, 2ol9\n\nPage 8\nmerely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. oo Cr. 773,\n2ooo WL ll34364, at *l (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ooo) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application\nfor bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing\ndefendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. l8 Cr. o47, 2ol8 WL 888744,\nat *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2ol8) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 4l (D.D.C.\n2oo5) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. o2 Cr. o99, 2oo2 WL 3l4lo262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nOct. lo, 2oo2) (same).\n\nFinally, there can be litle doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of\ndollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of\nhis life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the\nreach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to\nthis District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered\nin conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant\ncould receive if convicted.\n\nB. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in\nObstruction of Justice\n\nThe release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the\ncommunity and to the ongoing investigation.\n\nAs described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has\ncommited an offense under l8 U.S.C. § l59l, it is presumed that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). Here, not\nonly is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already\npreviously admited to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in\nJune 2oo8, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the\nage of l8 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under\nclassification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of commiting another\nsex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the\n2oo8 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.\n\nAdditionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,\nthere were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or\nother obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were\ndiscussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the\ndefendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with\nreference to l8 U.S.C. § l5l2, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or\ninformant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors\nin SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant\nhad “atempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to atend an\nofficial proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both\n[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to\natempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo35o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000408.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 2o Filed o7/l6/l9 Page 3 of 24 3\nj782epsC kjc\n\nl decide under what conditions, if any, you should be released.\n\n2 Can I have the date and time of arrest, please?\n\n3 MR.

Richard M. Berman\nUnited States District Judge\nJuly l6, 2ol9\nPage 3\nIV. Cash and Diamonds\nAt the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash\nwere seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhatan residence. The Court inquired as to the value\nof these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials\nfrom the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $7o,ooo in cash. In\naddition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately l carat\nto 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether\nthe defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other\nlocations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the\njurisdiction at a moment’s notice.\nV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2ol9 and July l2, 2ol9\ndetention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the\ndefendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the\npresumption that there is no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued\nappearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.\nRespectfully submited,\nGEOFFREY S.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44 Qd Cir.\n\nl986). The Indictment in this case was returned by a grand jury thus establishing probable cause |\nthat the defendant commited the crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. See\nUnited States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 55 (2d Cir. l985) (“[A]n indictment returned by a duly |\nconstituted grand jury conclusively establishes the existence of probable cause for the purpose of\ntriggering the rebutable presumptions set forth in § 3l42(e)”). In most federal cases the\n\nrebutable presumption that applies favors pretrial release, not remand.\n\nThere is another very important issue to be considered in this case. It has to do with\n“victims” of the crimes charged in the Indictment. Victims refer to the “minor” girls who are\nalleged to have been sexually trafficked by the Defendant. Under l8 U.S.C. § 377l, victims are\nentitled to be heard in court, including on the question of whether the defendant is to be released\nor remanded. Victims have, among other things, been given the opportunity to testify at the bail\nhearing.\n\nB. Counsels’ Submissions\n\nThe Government’s leter application, dated July 8, 2ol9, requests that the Court remand :\nMr. Epstein. It argues that Mr. Epstein “poses [] an acute danger to the community” and,\ngrounded in past experience with this Defendant, that “if [Mr. Epstein is] alloued to remain out\non bail, the defendant could atempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses\nin this case, including victims and their families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice.” Dkt.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo473", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000480.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page 9 of 33 .\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v. Paulino, 335 F. :\nSupp. 3d 6oo, 6lo (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (quoting United States v. Shakur, 8l7 F.2d l89, l96 (2d Cir. |\nl987). |\n\n“The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the |\npresentation and consideration of information at the [release/remand] hearing.” l8 U.S.C. § :\n\n3l42(f)(2) (emphasis added). For example, the Government is entitled to present evidence\nsupporting remand by way of proffer, among other means. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f)(2); see also\ni United States v. LaFontaine, 2lo F.3d l25, l3l (2d Cir. 2ooo) (“bail hearings are typically\n\ninformal affairs, not substitutes for trial or even for discovery”). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42((2)(B)\nexpressly states that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at bail hearings; thus, courts\noften base detention decisions on hearsay evidence. United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F. App’x 25, 27 (2d Cir. 2ol2).\n\nE. The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial detention, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool). The\nGovernment retains the “ultimate burden of persuasion” that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo48o /", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000484.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 32 Filed o7/l8/l9 Page l3 of 33 |\n|\n*lo (D.D.C. May 22, 2ol9). The presumption of remand “reflects Congress’s substantive :\njudgment that particular classes of offenders should ordinarily be detained prior to trial.” United |\nStates v. Stone, 6o8 F.3d 939, 945 (6th Cir. 2olo). Other serious offenses that are accompanied\nby the presumption of remand are: Kidnapping (l8 U.S.C. § l2ol); Aggravated Sexual Abuse |\n(l8 U.S.C. § 224l); Sexual Abuse (l8 U.S.C. § 2242); Offenses Resulting in Death (l8 U.S.C. §\n2245); Sexual Exploitation of Children (l8 U.S.C. § 225l); Selling or Buying of Children (l8 |\nU.S.C. § 225l); Production of Sexually Explicit Depictions of a Minor for importation into the |\nUnited States (l8 U.S.C. § 226o); Coercion and Enticement (l8 U.S.C. § 2422); Transport of |\nMinors (l8 U.S.C. § 2423); Use of Interstate Facilities to Transmit Information About a Minor\n(l8 U.S.C. § 2425). l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). |\nThe presumption of remand does not disappear even when rebuted. Martir, 782 F.2d at\nll44. If the defendant comes forward with evidence that he will not endanger the community or |\nflee the jurisdiction, the presumption “is not erased.” See United States v. Dominguez, 783 F.2d\n7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986). “Rather, the presumption remains in the case as an evidentiary finding |\nmilitating against release, to be weighted along with other evidence.” United States v. Hir, 5l7\nF.3d lo8l, lo86 (9th Cir. 2oo8); see also Martir, 782 F.2d at ll44 (“The concern underlying the\n| presumption applies to the general class of defendants charged with one of the specified\noffenses—not merely to defendants who fail to produce rebutal evidence.

Epstein, |\nl55 F.Supp.2d 323, 326 (E.D.

The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |\nthe evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |\nhis residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |\nresources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |\nimposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |\nflee.

So I hope everybody can hear me.\n\n6 The purpose of today's proceeding, as I'm sure you're\n7 all aware, is to conduct a bail hearing. In this mater, as I\n8 think you knou, the government is seeking continued pretrial\n\n9 remand of Mr. Epstein and the defense is arguing for pretrial\nlo release. The parties have submited helpful writen\n\nll submissions, and they have been placed on the docket.\n\nl2 You should also be aware, if you weren't -- I don't\n\nl3 think you are -- that there is what's called a pretrial\n\nl4 services report.

Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\nTailoring.\n\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\ndisclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-88 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\ndisclosure and, if so, the narrouest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000785.jpg": "Cas@’4Sfol4-o648o-RMB DbeuMenPsy Piles HY lSuisagsaye FoF 33 |\npretrial release. § 3l42 states that: “if there is probable cause to believe that the person |\ncommited ... an offense involving a minor victim under section .. . l59l,” then “it shall be |\npresumed that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the person as required and the safety of the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E) (emphasis added); see United States v.

The Indictment in this case was returned by a grand jury thus establishing probable cause |\nthat the defendant commited the crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy.

Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 55 (2d Cir. l985) (“[A]n indictment returned by a duly |\nconstituted grand jury conclusively establishes the existence of probable cause for the purpose of\ntriggering the rebutable presumptions set forth in § 3l42(e)”). In most federal cases the\nrebutable presumption that applies favors pretrial release, not remand.\n\nThere is another very important issue to be considered in this case. It has to do with\n“victims” of the crimes charged in the Indictment. Victims refer to the “minor” girls who are\nalleged to have been sexually trafficked by the Defendant. Under l8 U.S.C. § 377l, victims are\nentitled to be heard in court, including on the question of whether the defendant is to be released\nor remanded. Victims have, among other things, been given the opportunity to testify at the bail\nhearing.\n\nB.

It argues that Mr. Epstein “poses [] an acute danger to the community” and,\ngrounded in past experience with this Defendant, that “if [Mr. Epstein is] alloued to remain out\non bail, the defendant could atempt to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses\nin this case, including victims and their families, and otherwise atempt to obstruct justice.” Dkt.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo785", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000792.jpg": "Cas@-4Sfol4-4648o-RMB DbeuMenPsh Piles OY lsuisageaye FoF 33 |\ndefendant’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g). “The weight afforded to each factor under section |\n3l42(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district court.” United States v.

United States v. Abuhamra, 389 F.3d 3o9,\n32l n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) “District courts [are afforded] wide discretion regarding the scope of such\nhearings... .” United States v. Bartok, 472 F.

The Presumption of Remand in l8 U.S.C. § l59l Cases |\n\nA l8 U.S.C. § l59l case involving sexual victimization of a minor is unusual in that it\nincludes a presumption in favor of pretrial detention, reflecting the significant harm caused by\nsuch a crime. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The presumption is that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure against flight or danger to the community. United States v.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E)). Mr. Epstein may\nrebut the presumption by “coming forward with evidence that he does not pose a danger to the\ncommunity or a risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool).

Dominguez, 783 F.2d\n7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986). “Rather, the presumption remains in the case as an evidentiary finding |\nmilitating against release, to be weighted along with other evidence.” United States v.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant\nwas a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions would ensure her\nappearance. It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a renewed\nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December\nl4, 2o2o. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2o2o, the Court denied that motion, concluding that\nthe Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her\nappearance. Dkt. Nos. lo4, lo6.\n\nThe Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l6o.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo865", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000866.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-ooSB Adin dd Gumein47lB92 FiRRG6S/22/Phg Rage BLof l2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited). Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo866", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000867.jpg": "CaseGa26-2-ooSB Adin did Gumein47lB92 FiRRG6S/22/Phg Page Wof l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo867", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000868.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-ooSB Adin ddd Gumein47lB92 FiRG6S/22/Phg Rage Pof l2\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 95o F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. l99l) (“[A] defendant must\nintroduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption.”).\nNonetheless, “‘the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing\nevidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.’” English, 629 F.3d at\n3l9 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”’).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n5\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo868", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000873.jpg": "CaseGia26-2-oo28MAdhn db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/PagPeyefiWof l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo873", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000874.jpg": "CaseCGia26-2l-oo28 Adin db GuMeiM4lBo2 FiRGHOS/22/Pag Pegefilof l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo874", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000895.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagel9 of 25\nmotion.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates.

The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000951.jpg": "Cage l24 O/CRODBBOHAEN 2OdcUMENt/2o FilecOOAS2o2P aPage of Goo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo95l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000958.jpg": "CSS889 2D-CFOdSSCUAIIN Seen UHI &Pitdd BHP Page D/P i2eoo\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo962", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000965.jpg": "CE8E9 2o-CFOISSCUAIIN Dobe l &Pitdd BPP POLO Page SP '26oo\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2.

The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42,\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption.

As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo97l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000998.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBaGuisnt DOM 22o FilesoOAI3o2 aPage aM26lol9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Zarrab, No. l5 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2ol6 WL\n368 l423, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June l6, 2ol6)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially\nnothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV. The COVID-l9 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release\n\nFinally, the current pandemic is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in\nthis district have regularly rejected applications for release based on assertions about the\ngeneralized risks of COVID-l9. See, e.g., United States v.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll47", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001149.jpg": "CaSede2ol er-OoFZocAdNE n De GmMeholooo 2Filed 425o8) 26a Rage 7l Ob 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll49", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001151.jpg": "CaSesb:2o-cr/ oo 8B G+ANEt DOEUMEr? loo2 Filed6R248/7thgPageb l636\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll5l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001152.jpg": "CaSede2ol er Co F3ZocAdNt n Die GmMenolooo AFiled 425o8)26a Rdgect o Gb 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring detention.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\ndetention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v.

The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll53", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001157.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 2A ile@ 425o8)26adedGecl 5 Ob 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll57", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001170.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD F3ocAIN n DUEGmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26a deaGeck 8 Ob 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001174.jpg": "CaSede2ot er WD I3ocAIN n DUE Gmeholooo 7A ile@ 425o8) 26 a deagecs A Ob 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll74", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001210.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-oo BRGY DOciuMe rt l/26 2 FileehBaSO/ Pa gPegefliGhy a\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:_l2/28/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\nVv\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION AND ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July l4,\n2o2o. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the\nDefendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions would\nensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied.\nThe Defendant has nou filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which\nthe Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\nhave been made then. In any event, the new information provided in the renewed application\nonly solidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2lo", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001211.jpg": "Caesast:2o-cr-ooBRGuIAnt DOciunef ll86 2 Filee6BaSo/ Page agehilGh22\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B).

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool2l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001222.jpg": "CaSade2Oter WM I3ocAdnen Lee Gmeholo4o 2A il @ 4243o) 26a geageol 3 G5 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool222", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001230.jpg": "CaSade2ter MW I3oca one n Lee Gmeh'ol o4o 2F il €@ 4273o) 26a GeaGec? l Gb 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool243", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001244.jpg": "Caseel24o/fOoo88oHAEN Add uUMeht /LOF l FileadsasO9F2Ag ePage?lGhe\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant\nwas a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions would ensure her\nappearance. It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a renewed\nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December\nl4, 2o2o. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2o2o, the Court denied that motion, concluding that\nthe Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her\nappearance. Dkt. Nos. lo4, lo6.\nThe Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l6o.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool275", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001276.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAdNnt Tibsutrent l682 lF iO 83222/2agFlagec8 o642\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited). Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool276", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001277.jpg": "Cased 2o-€rOd33ouAUNnt Tibsutent l682 lF iO 837222/24gPFlaGeot o642\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2ol5) (noting the\n“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision’’).\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool277", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001278.jpg": "Cased 2o-CrOd33ouAuNit Tibsutrent l682 lFikO83222/2agFliagew o642\nIf, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense\nspecifically enumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the\ncommunity or others. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v. English, 629\nF.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir.\n2ool)); see also United States v.

Martir, 782 F.2d ll4l, ll44\n(2d Cir. l986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case].”).\nEven when “a defendant has met his burden of production,” houever, “the presumption favoring\ndetention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed\nby the district court.” United States v. Matis, 963 F.3d 285, 29o-9l (2d Cir. 2o2o).\nIi. Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooool278", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001283.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G ANA B6cuMe?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ol65l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooool283", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001284.jpg": "Casest: 2o-cr/ooB8G AUN D6cuMen?t VEO 2 Filedsas/22/PagPage 4ll6l5l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooool284", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001291.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7/oroo 2artauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth62o6/PhgP aye df d6i6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.

He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B.

The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v.

See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooool297", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001298.jpg": "Gaseel2l\\7 /oroo 2axtauivient DocumMdil B62 Fileth662o6/PhgPage & 6656\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- ooool298", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001301.jpg": "Cass :27-CrO2o48 UMM nIDechMehD3OW 2FileoO2l66/A2adedge bi HFl6\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool488", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001491.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 5of lo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).

Discussion\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and\ntherefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case.

The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooool49l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001492.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document4 Filed o7/o2/2o Page 6of lo\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“[T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government .. . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool492", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001582.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 2 of 26\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooool586", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001589.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 _ Filed o7/lo/2o Page 9 of 26\ninnocence.”). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell.\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooool589", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001593.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentl8 Filed o7/lo/2o Page l3 of 26\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons”\njustifying her release. See id.*\n\nIL. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42.\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shail order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive .. . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n* See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose. . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll-7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D.

Although the presumption “remains a factor\nto be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[a]t all times . . .\nthe government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the\nevidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (citation and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States\nv.

As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court.

The\n\n2 Supreme Court has and the Second Circuit has advised us that a\n3 very limited number of people should be detained prior to trial\n4 because of the statute's structure, and the government nouhere\n5 mentions that.

We\n2l decided that we should come before your Honor with a package\n22 that was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided by\n23 the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by\n24 Pretrial Services and the court.

Five\nmonths ago, after thorough briefing and a nearly two-hour hearing, this Court concluded that the\ndefendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nensure her appearance in court. The defense nou asks this Court to reverse that finding by\nessentially repackaging its prior arguments and presenting a more specific bail package.

The Court’s conclusion was plainly correct,\nand the Renewed Bail Motion does nothing to undermine it. The offense conduct outlined in the\nIndictment remains incredibly serious, the evidence against the defendant remains strong, and the\ndefendant continues to have extensive financial resources and foreign ties, as well as the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l65", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002166.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 5 of 36\ndemonstrated ability to live in hiding for the long term. In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Four charges the defendant\nwith transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.\nCounts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l66", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002168.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 7 of 36\nfrom us, we would respectfully request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so that\nwe can try to satisfy the court because we want to.”)).\n\nThe Court declined the defense’s request and instead concluded that the defendant posed a\nserious flight risk and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her appearance. First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2l68", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002170.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 9 of 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002171.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page lo of 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring detention.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\ndetention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page ll of 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002176.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page l5 of 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l76", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 28 of 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l89", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002193.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document loo Filed l2/l8/2o Page 32 of 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2l93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002233.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page Lof22  ._\n\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/28/2o __ |]\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION AND ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\n\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\n\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\n\nhave been made then.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!\n\nl. Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997.

On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’”” United States v.

The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2239", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002245.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Documentlo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page l3 of 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDefendant’s financial resources, in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2245", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document lo6 Filed l2/3o/2o Page 2l of 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2748", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002749.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l65 Filed o3/o9/2l Page 2 of 9\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl.

The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2768", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002769.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 3 of l2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v.

Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2769", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002770.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page 4 of l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f).

See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo277l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002776.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l69 Filed o3/22/2l Page lo of l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature.

But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2777", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002829.jpg": "CaGadse2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOmouRaiehd Fieebda22e/? l Pafagect 26 2o\nA. Underrepresentation :\nThe second element under Duren examines whether the groups’ representation “in |\nvenires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such\npersons in the community.” 439 U.S. at 364. To answer this question, houever, the Court must\nfirst define the relevant variables, namely (a) the jury venire and (b) the community. |\nls Relevant Jury Venire |\nThe parties dispute which jury pool ought to be used to analyze the Defendant's fair\ncross-section challenge. Schulte relies on United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 648, and contends |\nthat the White Plains qualified wheel is the relevant jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 8.) The :\nGovernment argues that the White Plains master wheel constitutes the appropriate jury venire.\n(Gov’t Opp. Br. at l5.) The Court agrees with the Government. |\n“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’ |\nwith any specificity.” United States v. Rioux, 93o F. Supp. l558, l565 (D. Conn. l995) :\n(examining caselaw); see also Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458 (stating that the “Second Circuit has not :\nstated a preference for the use of one wheel over the other”). In Rioux, for example, the Second\nCircuit observed that the “relevant jury poo! may be defined by: (l) the master list; (2) the\nqualified wheel; (3) the venires, or (4) a <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of the three.” 97 F.3d at 655-56.\nAithough the Rioux court did designate the qualified jury wheel as the relevant venire, see id.,\nthat conclusion only folloued because the parties agreed “that the qualified wheel may serve as\nthe relevant jury pool.” Jd. That is not the case here, so the Court finds Rioux to be of litle\nimpact.\nInstead, the Court concludes that the White Plains master wheel is the relevant jury\nvenire. As noted by the Government (Gov’t Opp. Br. at l6-l8) several district courts within this\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2829", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003137.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o3 of 239\n(denying bill of particulars request in stock fraud case where indictment was fifteen pages long\nand substantial discovery had been provided).\n\nAlthough the Government cannot provide “mountains of documents to defense counsel”\nas a substitute for a bill of particulars where one would otherwise be required, see Bortnovsky, 82o\nF.2d at 575, the provision of voluminous discovery in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with some guidance about what\nis most relevant can vitiate a need for further particulars, see, e.g., United States v.

Supp. 2d 368, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (denying request for particularization of alleged\nmisrepresentations where the indictment was thirty-four pages long and Government had provided\nvoluminous, organized discovery). In no event should volume of discovery alone warrant a bill of\nparticulars; “[w]hile [a] [c]ourt may sympathize with counsel’s task of reviewing a large quantity\nof materials that continue to be produced,” that concern is addressed by granting the defense\nsufficient time in which to conduct the review in advance of trial.

Ultimately,\nthe district court in Rioux found that the teaching of Duren and the Second Circuit’s subsequent\ncases is that “the court must assess representativeness in the context of the systematic defect\nidentified by the defendant.” /d. at l568. In that case, the claimed defects were in the construction\nof the qualified wheel and, therefore, the “relevant jury pool” was the “qualified wheel over the\nlife of the wheel.” /d. at l575.\n\nAffirming that decision, the Second Circuit did not hold that the qualified wheel is\nnecessarily the “relevant jury pool.” Rather, after stating that the relevant jury pool “may be\ndefined by: (l) the master list; (2) the qualified wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of the\nthree,” the Circuit noted that the parties had agreed that the district court properly used the qualified\nwheel over the life of the wheel as the “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657. The court’s\nacceptance of the qualified jury wheel as the “relevant jury pool” for that case—an issue which\nwas not in dispute—does not mean it necessarily must be applied in all cases. Jd. Indeed, in other\ncases where the claim of error was not focused on the construction of the qualified wheel, different\n“relevant jury pools” have been used by the Second Circuit. Most notably, in Biaggi, the main\nthrust of the defendant’s fair cross-section claim was that reliance on voter registration lists\nsystemically excluded African-Americans and Hispanics from jury service—a claim which is\ndirected at the composition of the master wheel—and the Second Circuit identified the district’s\nmaster wheel as the relevant jury pool. United States v. Biaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o).\n\nHere, the defendant claims that “the primary reason” for the alleged underrepresentation is\nthe Government’s “choice to pursue an indictment from a grand jury drawn from the White Plains\nDivision, as opposed to the Manhatan Division . . . .” (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). Even if this argument\ndescribed a function of the jury selection process — though it does not — it would be directed at the\n\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003172.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 238 of 239\n2ol2) (affirming Judge Bianco’s “thorough and well-reasoned” opinion). Indeed, “‘[a] selection\nprocess that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic exclusion.’” United States v.\nSavage, 97o F.3d 2l7, 259 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (brackets in original) (quoting Houell v. Superintendent\nRockview SCI, 939 F.3d 26o, 269 (2d Cir. 2ol9)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a\nprima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>, might\ncontribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).\n\nInsofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains\nQualified Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhatan Division” or entire Southern\nDistrict, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an\nindictment in White Plains rather than Manhatan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely\nproper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.l, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision\nresulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic\nexclusion . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an\nindictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has\nnothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no\nother source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any identified group. Accordingly, the\ndefendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.\n\n2ll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l72", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003244.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 68 of 348\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues.

OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed.

In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this production with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted throughout the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall production. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to investigate or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 69 of 349\nMenchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:\nBoth the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate\nand, in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with other maters in the past, it seriously calls\nyour judgment into question.\nAs you well knou, the US Atorney has not even decided whether\nto go forward with a prosecution in this mater, thus you should have\nrespected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.\nAlong that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you\nmade to the agents in this mater, it was made clear to you by the US\nAtorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first\nauthorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns\nabout taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of\nlegal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting.

It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge.

OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach.

Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ll", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI.

Using\nthe search capabilities of Google Scholar, I found no use of the word “groom-\ning” to mean such techniques in conjunction with the terms “child sexual\nabuse,” “child molestation,” or “child molester” in the professional literature\nfrom l85o through l983.

One type of\nevidence is direct evidence. One kind of direct evidence is a witness’s testimony about\nsomething that the witness knous by virtue of his or her oun senses—something that the witness\nhas seen, smelled, touched, or heard. Direct evidence may also be in the form of an exhibit.\n\nThe other type of evidence is circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is\nevidence that tends to prove one fact by proof of other facts. There is a simple example of\ncircumstantial evidence that is often used in this courthouse.\n\nAssume that when you came into the courthouse this morning the sun was shining and it\nwas a nice day. Assume that there are blinds on the courtroom windous that are drawn and that\nyou cannot look outside. As you are siting here, someone walks in with an umbrella that is\ndripping wet. Someone else then walks in with a raincoat that is also dripping wet.\n\nNou, you cannot look outside the courtroom and you cannot see whether or not it is\nraining. So you have no direct evidence of that fact. But on the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of the facts that I\nhave asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical for you to conclude that between\nthe time you arrived at the courthouse and the time these people walked in, it had started to rain.\n\nThat is all there is to circumstantial evidence. You infer based on reason, experience, and\ncommon sense from an established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some other fact.\n\nMany facts, such as a person’s state of mind, can only rarely be proved by direct\nevidence. Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than direct evidence. It is a general rule\nthat the law makes no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but simply requires\nthat, before convicting each defendantMs. Maxwell, you, the jury, must be satisfied ofeach-\n\ndefendants her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt from all the evidence in the case.\n63\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l29", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006183.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page 3ofl4\n\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 3\nprofessional publications.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l83", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page6ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

The Court explained:\n\nthe charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and\n\ncarry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence\n\nproffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\n\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial\n\nresources and foreign ties (including citizenship in a country that\n\ndoes not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in\n\nhiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important\n\nties, has not been fully candid about her financial situation.\n(/d. at 2).

(See United States\nv. Maxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 89 (2d Cir. May l7, 2o2l)). In the motion, she renewed her claims\nthat the “horrific conditions [at MDC] make it impossible to prepare for trial.” (/d. at 2; see also\nid. at 2-3 (listing alleged horrific conditions, such as sleep deprivation, broun water, surveillance\nof atorney-client meetings, overflouing sewage, computer without sufficient capacity to review\ndiscovery)). The Second Circuit denied her motion in a writen order. (See United States v.\nMaxwell, No. 2l-58, Dkt. 96 (2d Cir. June 2, 2o2l)).\n\nB. Applicable Law\n\nIn seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden of shouing, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of flight, and that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions would reasonably assure her presence in court. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f);\nUnited States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7).\n\nHouever, where, as here, the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including offenses\ninvolving a minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ l59l, 2422 or 2423, a statutory presumption arises\n“that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the\nperson as required... .” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, the defendant “bears a limited\nburden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward\nwith evidence that [s]he does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6256", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page /7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67).

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed disclosure.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; disclosure; latency to disclosure; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

Atached as Exhibit C is a list of material\nreviewed by Dr. Dietz.\n\nHis testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the follouing:\n\na. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7497", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 7 of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Opinions about Dr. Rocchio’s Disclosed Opinions\n\nThe first use of the word “grooming” to refer to strategies that sometimes enable\nnonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition\nthat “the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of kindness, atention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are\nexpertly applied” (Conte, l984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by\nsocial scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended\nconsequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these:\n\n(l) Because use of the term “grooming” commonly assumes that the grooming party is\n\nintentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to\n\nprevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word “grooming” has acquired meaning\n\nbeyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without\n\nadequate evidence of either.\n\n(2) In the litigation context, “when ‘grooming’ is applied to such common and desirable\n\nbehaviors as being kind or atentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of\n\nmisleading the fact finder into believing that these later behaviors are well established\n\npredictors of child sexual abuse,” when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and\n\nSeduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 3l (2ol8). Dr. Rocchio characterizes\n\n“srooming” as “a strategic patern of behavior[] . . . that can take a variety of forms and\n\nfunction to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and\n\nto build trust and atachment with their abuser.” This vague opinion about “grooming”\n\ncarries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination\n\nof motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility\n\nof witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion\n\ncarries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated\n\nwith nefarious or criminal conduct.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8o73", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008076.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5o7-l Filed ll/24/2l Page 7ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 6\nhalo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental\ndisorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and\nvice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2ol7).\n\nHalo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a\nstate in which atitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive\nconsistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2ol2), cognitive\nconsistency is “essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allou for\nthe predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters” (p. 67). Indeed, the noted\npsychologist Leon Festinger “was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive\nconsistency is as basic as hunger and thirst” (Gawronski, 2ol2, p. 652). But because the world is\noften not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to\nimpose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which “decisions follou\nfrom evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift touard coherence with the emerging\ndecision” (Simon, Snou, & Read, 2oo4, p. 8l4; Greenspan & Scurich, 2ol6). As a result,\nperceptions and decisions become highly skewed touard one interpretation while alternatives are\nneglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs\nunconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception.\n\nHalo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham\n\n(2ol6):\n\nOnce unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can\n\neasily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for hou a target is\n\ntreated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may\n\nselectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information\n\navailable (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn\n\nlead to preferential treatment in a range of domains:\n\ninterpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even\n\nfor decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286)\nLike many people who achieve great pouer and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect\nto surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his\nwealth atracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated\nlevel, others with halos of their oun—through any <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of pouer, influence, fame,\nbrilliance, atractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein\nfor reasons of their oun, and being seen in their company empouered him and made him look\nabove suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between\ndifferent kinds of pouer—such as Bill Clinton’s political pouer, wrestlers’ and weight lifters’\nphysical pouer, and Gerry Edelman’s intellectual pouer—and acknouledged that he gravitated\nto people of pouer.

Given Juror No. 5o’s personal experience and belief about memory and its\nreliability, there was no way he could fairly evaluate Ms. Maxwell’s challenge to the\ncredibility of her accusers’ memories or the expert testimony of Dr. Loftus.'*\n\nSeveral decisions support this conclusion. In Sampson v. United States, for\nexample, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision to order a new penalty-\nphase hearing in a death penalty case after a juror falsely denied, among other things,\nhaving been a victim of a crime. 724 F.3d at l54, l62. In fact, houever, the juror\nrepeatedly had been menaced by her husband with a shotgun. /d. at l68. But because the\njuror had not told the truth during voir dire, she was seated on a jury in a case involving a\nbank robbery in which the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These\nparallels,” the Court said, “raise a serious concern as to whether an ordinary person in\n[the juror’s] shoes would be able to disregard her oun experiences in evaluating the\nevidence.” Jd.\n\nTo be sure, the juror in Sampson did not limit her false answers to a single\nquestion. She also answered falsely to several other questions during voir dire, some\nmaterial and some not. /d. at l62-63, l66. A <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of factors led the First Circuit\nto affirm the order for a new penalty-phase hearing. /d. at l68. Here, Juror No. 5o’s false\n\nJuror No. 5o’s confidence in his memory is not necessarily a predictor of the\nmemory’s reliability. As Dr. Loftus testified, “when you have post-event suggestion or\nintervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers, and you can see that\neven wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high\ndegree of confidence.” TR at 243o.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9o4l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6l5_ Filed o2/24/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v.

The jury\nevidently credited this testimony, and based on that testimony and the reasonable inferences from\nit, a rational jury easily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.\n\nThe defendant has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on\nthe remaining counts, and for good reason. Just as the conspiracies in Counts One and Three are\nmultiplicitous because enticement and transportation are dual aims of the same conspiracy, see\nsupra Part III, Count Three is amply supported by the evidence underlying Count One. As to\nCount Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,\nincluding the specific incident in which Jane had difficulty returning from New York to Palm\nBeach, and that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-69; see Tr.\n3l6-l7 (testimony that the defendant traveled with Jane on Epstein’s private jet and would “assist”\nin “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would ask her,\nhey, can you get Jane, you knou, tickets and the times and whatnot and make the arrangements to\nbe picked up.”).

As Dr. Loftus testified, “when you have post-event suggestion or\nintervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers, and you can see that\neven wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high\ndegree of confidence.” TR at 243o.\n\n33\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9732", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009826.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 643 Filed o3/ll/22 Page 28 of 49\n\nalso decline to hold as a general mater that, where a juror has\n\nengaged in conduct similar to that of the defendant at trial, the trial\n\njudge must presume bias. Such cases are unlikely to present the\n\n“extreme situations” that call for mandatory removal.\nTorres, l28 F.3d at 46; see also id. at 46 & n.ll (rejecting A//sup decision from Ninth Circuit that\ncourt must presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences were biased”). Thus, to\nthe extent the cases cited by the defendant purport to require such a presumption of bias, they are\ninconsistent with binding Second Circuit precedent. (See, e.g., Def. Mem. at 3l (citing United\nStates v. Eubanks, 59l F.2d 5l3, 5l7 (9th Cir. l979), which relied on Al/sup)).\n\nThe remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some merely state a general\nproposition that similarity of experiences may give rise to a presumption of bias, but then go on to\nresolve the case on other grounds. See, e.g., Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l7-l8\n(loth Cir. l998); United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated\nby United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). Others find that a juror should have been\nstruck not merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on a number of other factors\nnot present here. For example, in one case prominently cited by the defendant, a juror in the\npenalty phase of a death penalty case told a “litany of lies,” and the First Circuit declined to rest\nits decision on any particular category of bias, but instead cited the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of the juror’s\ninterpersonal relationships, inability to separate emotion from duty, similarity of experiences,\nscope and severity of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may\nbe insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United\nStates, 724 F.3d l5o, l6l, l66-68 (lst Cir. 2ol3); see also Hunley v. Godinez, 975 F.2d 3l6, 3l9-\n2o (7th Cir. l992) (citing <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of factors in “extreme” case where two jurors were\nburglarized during deliberations and then changed their votes as a result, and stating that “our\nholding is limited to the very unique facts stated herein” and “[iJt is unlikely these rare\n\n26\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9826", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009937.jpg": "CESRSEARORGORES DARN Dan GSA FSO DAPDZP ab dtpeg 8 G36 i cf 767\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, v\n\nPAUL M.

They have three\nboys -- ages l7, l5, and l2 -- whom they have raised conscientiously.

Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. /d.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l.

Ms. Maxwell was also worried for herself, having legitimate reason\nto fear for her oun life.\n\nDespite having the benefits of foreign citizenship, Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized American\ncitizen, remained in the United States consistently after Epstein’s death, never evading the\nauthorities. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Maxwell was not considering flight — even though, given\nher French and British nationalities, she could have taken refuge in these and other countries at\nany time. Law enforcement had been discreetly keeping tabs on her throughout the course of its\ninvestigation.> Her lawyers had been in contact with prosecutors in the months preceding her\narrest and would have arranged for her self-surrender. Ms. Maxwell’s presence in New Hampshire\nwas driven solely by the need to protect herself and her family from threats of physical harm and\nfrom the unprecedented and escalating press and public vilification she had to endure since\nEpstein’s death.\n\nOn July 6, 2o2o, exactly a year to the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell was ordered\ndetained in the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) based on the government’s assertion that\nshe posed “an extreme risk of flight” and that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required.”® Each of four bail applications\nwere denied on the elusive claim of flight risk, despite the unprecedented financial collateral and\nrestrictions proposed to secure a hefty bond for an almost 6o-year-old woman who, the government\nconceded, posed no danger to the community, and who had never atempted to flee the United\nStates.

Given Maxwell’s role in the household and\nin the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this\nrecord is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding hou to schedule massages and run the part of\nthe scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls\nto schedule appointments follouing Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct\nthat the defendant needed to supervise a knouing participant in the scheme for the leadership\nenhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect\nto Kellen.\n\nGiven the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,\nabusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal\nover the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3Bl.l contemplated by the PSR.\n\nC.

(PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn\nexpressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. l678). Her pain was palpable on the\nwitness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.\n\nAs the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation\nconspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable\nyoung girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific\npredator and abuser of children.

As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell nou faces the very real\nprospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the\nsubstantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for\nthe defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,\nher citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United\nStates. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international\nconnections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a\nlengthy prison sentence.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9865", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019868.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAEN IOSdtuUM Ent /2o FilesOOAH2o2 P ahageb26ioLo\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).

The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence\n\nThe “nature and circumstances” of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges,\nthe defendant commited serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(g)(l) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim” as a\nfactor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool9868", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019869.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8-CoGGoR7FeIN 3DacOMENt 2o 2F il Go OFZoo/26a Gedgect 26o.o\nacts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42\n(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as l4 years\nold, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.\n\nThese offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’\nimprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in\nassessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. lo Cr. 4 (JL), 2olo WL 3o9679,\nat *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2olo) (“|The steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight\nrisk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .”) (quoting United States v.\nAlindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2oo9)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory\nmaximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone\nto flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at\nage 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.\n\nThe strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become\na fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong.\nMultiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the\ndefendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony,\nand other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence\ncorroborate the victims’ account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial\nin this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention.\n\nThe passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel\notherwise. As an initial mater, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 3283,\nwhich was amended in 2oo3 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool9869", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019876.jpg": "CAs8°F:26-CROBSSOIAIN BEcuMel l8 FikeOP AD Bo PagelZ of 26o\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nI.

Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the\nUnited States since l99l. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United\nKingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell\ngraduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in l99l, and has lived in this\ncountry ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her\nsix siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2ol9\nindictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her nou. She is especially close to two of her\nsisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has\nnumerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to\nmany of them. Ms. Maxwell’s family and friends have remained commited to her because they\ndo not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have knoun for\ndecades.\n\nThe Government’s Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in shouing\nthat detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that\nwill secure a defendant’s appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government\nrelies on the presumption of detention in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms.\nMaxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for\neach country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing\nrecent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law\nenforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular\ncontact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government\nargues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant\n\nZ\nDOJ-OGR-oool988o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019883.jpg": "Cast F-26-2oDS5O.ASN Bacturhert l8 HiedOPAO/bo Pages of 26o\ninnocence.”’). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell\npresents an “actual risk of flight” and must be detained under Section 3l42. The strict bail\nconditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the “least restrictive”\nset of conditions that will “reasonably assure” Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in Court, without the\nhealth and access to counsel risks inherent in the government’s request that Ms. Maxwell be\ndetained pending trial. See l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 (c)(l)(B). Under the controlling legal standards,\nMs. Maxwell should be released on bail.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nThere are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell’s release\non bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed:\n\nFirst, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-l9 if she is detained,\nand she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the\nrestrictions that have been placed on atorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic.\n\nSecond, the government has failed to carry its burden under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42 that no\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in\ncourt.\n\nI. The Conditions Created by the COVID-l9 Pandemic Mandate the Release of\n\nMs. Maxwell,\n\nImpact of COVID-l9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by\nthe COVID-l9 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell’s release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions.\nFour months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, l5-CR-95 (AJN), 2o2o WL\nl295l55 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. l9, 2o2o), that COVID-l9 is an “unprecedented and extraordinarily\ndangerous” threat that justifies release on bail. /d. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no\nunderlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court’s\n\nb\nDOJ-OGR-oool9883", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019887.jpg": "Case 922 lcrDISSCUAUIN DstamteHPl &Pitdd B77 POH Pagers St 2o\ndocuments and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist\nin the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional “compelling reasons”\njustifying her release. See id.®\nII. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42,\n\nThe grave concerns raised by the current COVID-l9 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell\nmust be released because she has met her limited burden of production shouing that she does not\npose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nAs the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention\nprior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 48l\nU.S. 739, 755 (l987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.\nSabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (quoting l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)). The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(b))\n(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the\nappearance” of the defendant in court. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c). Where conditions are necessary,\nsuch release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a\nlimited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited).\n\n8 See also Leter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2o2o), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons, et al., No. l9 Civ. 66o (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc.

First, the government\nmust shou “by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant . . . presents an actual risk of\nflight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this\nburden, it must then “demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his\npresence in court.” Jd.\n\nIn determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the\nappearance of the defendant, the court must consider (l) the nature and circumstances of the\noffense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and\ncharacteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or\nthe community that would be posed by the person’s release. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nIn this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms.\nMaxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.\n\nThe Bail Reform Act contains a rebutable presumption, applicable based on certain of\nthe crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited burden of\nproduction—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with\nevidence that [she] does not pose . . . a risk of flight.” See United States v. English, 629 F.3d\n3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quotation omited). This rebutable presumption can be readily\nsatisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-ll—7o756 MAG (DMR), 2oll WL 342l32l, at *2\n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2oll), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a\ncategory listed in § 3l42(g) can affect the operation” of the presumption. United States v.\nDominguez, 783 F.2d 7o2, 7o7 (7th Cir. l986); see also United States v.

Although the presumption “remains a factor\nto be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[aJt all times. . .\nthe government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the\nevidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.\nEnglish, 629 F.3d at 3l9 (citation and internal quotation marks omited); see also United States\nv.

As set forth belou, Ms.\nMaxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior\nto her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same\nreasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which\nare consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,\nwill not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.\nMaxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9889", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019916.jpg": "CaSade2Oteh)d3GouAunnt Bibeutre/otl 22o 2Fil e@ FAL) 26a deagfect 2 Of l9\na country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to untold financial resources, and has every\nmotivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes.

Given the gravity of the charged\ncrimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under\noath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.\nV.

In short, the defendant poses an extreme\nflight risk, no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this\nDistrict, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAs detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately l994 and l997. The defendant\nplayed a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage\nin sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s\nabusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the\ndefendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences\nin different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and\nsubjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath\nduring a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.\n\nBased on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One\ncharges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage\nin illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing\na minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count\nThree charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to\nparticipate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l.

First, the\nCourt found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in favor of detention,”\ngiven the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving minor victims and the\npotential penalties those charges carry. (Tr. 82). Second, the Court determined that “[t]he\ngovernment’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong” based on the “multiple\nvictims who provided detailed accounts of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in serious crimes,” as well\nas corroboration in the form of “significant contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Jd.).\nThird, the Court found that the defendant’s history and characteristics demonstrate that the\ndefendant poses a risk of flight. (Tr. 83).\n\nIn addressing that third factor, the Court emphasized the defendant’s “substantial\ninternational ties,’ which “could facilitate living abroad,’ including “multiple foreign\ncitizenships,” “familial and personal connections abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of\nsignificant value.” (Tr. 83). The Court also noted that the defendant “is a citizen of France, a\nnation that does not appear to extradite its citizens.” (/d.). The Court further found that the\ndefendant “possesses extraordinary financial resources” and that “the representations made to\nPretrial Services regarding the defendant’s finances likely do not provide a complete and candid\npicture of the resources available.” (Tr. 83-84).\n\nAlthough the Court recognized that the defendant “does have some family and personal\nconnections to the United States,” the Court highlighted “the absence of any dependents,\nsignificant family ties or employment in the United States” in support of the conclusion that “flight\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo67", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020069.jpg": "CaSedeZ2ot ep C33ouAUNIt Bescutrentl loo2 lF iG 422o8/2 o9g Pagel I ob 36\n\nthe Court concluded that electronic monitoring and home security guards “would be insufficient”\nbecause the defendant could remove the monitor and evade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,\nthe Court rejected the defense’s arguments about the risks of COVID-l9 and the difficulty of\npreparing a defense with an incarcerated client. In so doing, the Court noted that the defendant\nhas no underlying conditions that place her at heightened risk of complications from COVID-l9\nand emphasized that the defendant had many months to prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-9o).\n\nViewing all of these factors together, the Court ordered the defendant detained pending\ntrial. (Tr. 9l).\n\nAPPLICABLE LAW\n\nUnder the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. §§ 3l4l et seq., federal courts are empouered to\norder a defendant detained pending trial upon a determination that the defendant poses a risk of\nflight. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e). When seeking detention on this ground, “[t]he Government bears the\nburden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant ‘presents an actual\nrisk of flight’ and that ‘no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could be imposed on the\ndefendant that would reasonably assure his presence in court.’” United States v. Boustani, 932\nF.3d 79, 8l (2d Cir. 2ol9) (quoting United States v. Sabhani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2oo7)). The\nBail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention analysis when the Government\nseeks detention based on flight risk: (l) the nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)\nthe weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the history and characteristics of the\ndefendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and] financial resources.” See l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(¢g). If a judicial officer concludes that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required . . . such judicial officer shall order the\ndetention of the person before trial.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo69", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020070.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN DEctIMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FHgPagetl Oost 36\n\nAdditionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving\na minor victim under l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be presumed, subject to rebutal, that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as\nrequired and the safety of the community. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). In such a case, “the\ndefendant ‘bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut\nthat presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose . . . a risk of flight.’”\nUnited States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d Cir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes,\n254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)). The act of producing such evidence, houever, “does not\neliminate the presumption favoring detention.” /d. Rather, the presumption “remains a factor to\nbe considered among those weighed by the district court,’ while the Government retains the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that the defendant presents a risk of flight. Mercedes, 254 F.3d\nat 436.\n\nWhen the Court has already issued a detention order, the Bail Reform Act provides that the\ndetention hearing “may be reopened . . . if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was\nnot knoun to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue of\nwhether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance” of the\ndefendant. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). Accordingly, “[a] court may properly reject an atempt to reopen\na detention hearing where the new information presented is immaterial to the issue of flight risk.”\nUnited States v. Petrov, l5 Cr. 66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26,\n2ol5). Although courts in this Circuit have recognized that “a release order may be reconsidered\neven where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the\noriginal hearing,” United States v. Roue, o2 Cr. 756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 2l, 2oo3), generally the moving party must establish that its arguments “warrant\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020071.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o BROAN BEciuMert loo2 Filed6Ra38/FgPagetlisef 36\nreconsideration” by, for example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked information or\nincorrectly applied the law,” or that failure to reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.”\nPetrov, 2ol5 WL llo2286 at *3.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nHaving already raised numerous arguments in its briefing and oral argument at the initial\nbail hearing in this case, the defense nou asks this Court to reverse itself based on virtually the\nsame arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same\nclaims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest\nthat the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents\nnew information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly knoun to the defendant\nat the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made\navailable (and thus rejected as immaterial) when ordering detention. Ultimately, nothing in the\nRenewed Bail Application alters the analysis that led this Court to conclude that the defendant\n“poses a substantial actual risk of flight,” and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could assure her\nappearance. (Tr. 86). All three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors still weigh heavily in favor\nof detention, and the defense claims to the contrary do not warrant a revisiting of this Court’s well-\nreasoned and thorough prior decision.\n\nA. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense\n\nThe first Bail Reform Act factor indisputably weighs in favor of detention in this case. The\negregious conduct charged in the Indictment gives rise to a statutory presumption of detention, and\nthe Renewed Bail Motion makes no effort to challenge this Court’s prior conclusion that the nature\nand circumstances of the offense support detention. The charges in the Indictment describe\nhorrendous conduct involving the sexual abuse of multiple minor victims. If convicted, the\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo7l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020075.jpg": "Cageab2o-ce6oBaGAdsnt Becument loo2 Filed6R238/2thg Page tl Sts 36\nand that certain of the corroborating documentary evidence does not specifically name Maxwell.\nLeaving aside the fact that volume is not a reliable proxy for quality, by its very nature, abusive\nsexual contact is not the type of crime that leaves extensive documentary evidence. But, as\ncorroborative documents refer only to Epstein, they still support these victims’ testimony, which\nwill detail their interactions with both the defendant and her co-conspirator, Epstein. In other\nwords, documentary evidence does exist, and as the Court has already found, the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nmultiple victims describing the same scheme, together with documents and other witnesses\nconfirming that those victims did indeed interact with the defendant and Epstein at the times and\nplaces they say they did, makes this a strong case. (Tr. 82).\n\nTaken together, this evidence confirms that the Government’s case remains as strong as it\nwas at the time of the defendant’s arrest. Accordingly, this factor continues to weigh heavily in\nfavor of detention.\n\nC. The Characteristics of the Defendant\n\nThe defendant’s history and characteristics include significant foreign ties, millions of\ndollars in cash that she largely transferred to her spouse in the last five years, among other assets,\nand a demonstrated willingness and sophisticated ability to live in hiding. The bulk of the\narguments in the Renewed Bail Motion focus on this factor in a manner that largely rehashes claims\nthat this Court already considered at the July l4, 2o2o hearing. Any new information provided\nwas either knoun by the defense at the time of the initial hearing, assumed to be the case when the\nCourt analyzed this factor at the initial hearing, or, in the case of the defense report regarding\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo75", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020088.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6o8BGHANt DEctIMe ri loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPage staf 36\nSeting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the\nfinancial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated\nwith the defendant. (See Def. Ex. O at lo). Based on the report, it seems clear that the defendant\nslouly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five\nyears. As a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the\ndefendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him\nrather than his oun independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee, she would\nlargely be sacrificing her oun money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse\nco-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s submission does not change the Government’s\nposition at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and\ncould live a comfortable life as a fugitive.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated\nability to live in hiding, and financial resources, confirm that the defendant’s characteristics\ncontinue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,\nthis is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company could conceivably be\nconsidered as a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2ol9). The\nSecond Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail\nsystem in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants\nare released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition\nCourt need not resolve this question, houever, because regardless of whether the defendant’s\nhusband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway from the\nfinancial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed\nbond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing his oun money if\nthe defendant fled.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo88", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020092.jpg": "Caseab2o-ce6oBBtlANt BEctMert loo2 Filed6R238/?tgPageB26af 36\nUnited States). Further, unlike those cases and the cases cited by the defendant, the crimes charged\nhere involving minor victims trigger a statutory presumption in favor of detention, weighing\nfurther in favor of detention. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436.\n\n“ach bail package in each case is considered and evaluated on its individual merits by the\nCourt.” Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 326. Unlike the cases cited by the defense, the Government\nseeks detention not solely on the basis that the defendant is of financial means and has foreign\ncitizenship. Rather, detention is warranted because the defendant is a citizen of multiple foreign\ncountries, including one that does not extradite its nationals, with “substantial international ties,”\n“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with\na demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons\ndiscussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,\nthe strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a\nsubstantial flight risk. (Tr. 82-9l). The defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and\nthe defense has not offered any new information sufficient to justify reversal of the Court’s prior\nfinding that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her appearance.\n\nD. Conditions of Confinement\n\nFinally, the Renewed Bail Application reiterates the same argument about the potential\nharms of detention on the defendant that this Court rejected at the initial bail hearing. (Tr. 42, 68-\n69). As was the case in July, these complaints do not warrant the defendant’s release.\n\nThe defendant continues to have more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review\nher discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her atorneys. Specifically, the\ndefendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.\nAlso during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo92", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020128.jpg": "CaSade2OtehQ)d3GouAunt Bibsutre/otl l26 lF ROG 3228o/2eg eeagef l OF ee\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:_l2/28/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\nVv\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nOPINION AND ORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

In her renewed motion, the Defendant atempts to respond to the\nreasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package.\nBut by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could\nhave been made then.

This is so because: the charges, which\ncarry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if\nconvicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and\ncorroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties\n(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who\nlived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she nou asserts important ties, has not been\nfully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court\ndenied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July l4, 2o2o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.’\n\n|e Background\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count\nIndictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of\nmultiple minor victims between approximately l994 and l997. See Dkt. No. l. On July 2, 2o2o,\nthe Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire.\nOn July 8, 2o2o, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small\nministerial corrections. Dkt. No. l7.\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).

Legal Standard\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, which prohibits the imposition of “|e|xcessive bail,” and under the Bail Reform\nAct, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant\n“subject to the least restrictive further condition, or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that | it]\ndetermines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any\nother person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(c)(l)(B). Only if, after considering the\nfactors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of\nany other person and the community,” may the Court order that the defendant be held without\nbail. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nIf there is probable cause to find that the defendant commited an offense specifically\nenumerated in § 3l42(e)(3), a rebutable presumption arises “that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure” the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or\nothers. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3). In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a limited burden of\nproduction .. . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose\na danger to the community or a risk of flight.’” United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3ll, 3l9 (2d\nCir. 2oll) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2ool)); see also\nUnited States v.

This newly\npresented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail\nhearing, includes evidence of the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at\nlo l4; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the\nDefendant’s financial conditions and assets, see id. at l5—l8; evidence that according to her\nrebuts the Government’s original contention that she atempted to evade law enforcement prior\nto her arrest, see id. at l8-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United\nKingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able\nto resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25—29; and evidence that she\nargues lays bare the weakness of the Government’s case against her, see id. at 3o-34.\n\nFinally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result\nof the COVID-l9 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the\nconditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate\nin her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34\n38.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the Defendant’s arguments, the Court again concludes\nthat no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol33", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020134.jpg": "CaGadeZOtepQ)d3GOuAuNt Bibsutre/ntl l26 lF h6G8228o/2o9o Faget 7l Ob 22\ndetention without bail is warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The Court accordingly denies\nDefendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail.\n\nA. The presumption in favor of detention applies\n\nThe Court is required to presume that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of\npretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act\nprovides that if a defendant is charged with commiting an offense involving a minor victim\nunder l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the\ncommunity if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person\ncommited.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s indictment by a grand jury suffices to\nestablish that there is probable cause to believe that she commited the offenses charged in the\nindictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 5l, 53-54 (2d Cir. l985) (noting that\nthat an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the\nexistence of probable cause” and that “the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a\npreliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant\nto Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omited)). In light of the\ncrimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.\n\nWhen the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production\n“tending to counter the § 3l42(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.l. The\nDefendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence\ncontrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 38o (lst Cir. l985),\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol34", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020140.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAuAnt Bbcinde rt l/262 Filee6Ba3o/Ptag Pagel Bos 22\nextradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process\nand, at worst, impossible.”’).\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the\nCourt’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of\nflight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal\nquestions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that\nany extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood\nthat the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to\nresolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any\nextradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition\nentirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.\n\nIn addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide\nher the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not\nby itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the\nDetendant’s financial resources, in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with her substantial international ties and\nforeign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the\npress, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23\n(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 3o9 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8),\n\n* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order\nhas been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27\n(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 7l7 F. Supp. lo48, lo52 (S.D.N.Y. l989)). The Court places\nlitle weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically\noffer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that\nmight result. The Court is unpersuaded.\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol4o", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020148.jpg": "Cageabe @-ce6oBaGAURnt Bbcinde rt l/262 FileehBa3o/Ptag PageRiss 22\n\nFinally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the\nspread of COVID-l9 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the\nincidence of COVID-l9 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly\nalarming. See COVID-l9: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, htps://www.bop.gov/\ncoronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2o2o) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and ll\nstaff members who have tested positive for COVID-l9). It could be argued that in the face of\nthis, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending\ntrial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not\nhesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government\nrests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court\nfound at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at\nheightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including\nincreasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court\nfinds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nE. A hearing is unnecessary\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is\nunnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides\ncomprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none\nof the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant\nposes a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July l4, 2o2o\nhearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in opposition to the defendant’s third\nmotion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2o2l (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).\n(Dkt. No. l6o). On July l4, 2o2o, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court\nconcluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2o2o, after the defendant\nrenewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her\nprior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a\nthorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied\nthe motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.\n(Dkt. No. lo6 at l-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2o2o decision\nto the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Nou, the defendant asks the Court yet\nagain to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail\npackage the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth belou, the Motion\nshould be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in\nwhich she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed\nthat December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction\nto grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the\ndefendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed\nby the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of\nconditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.\n\nI. Background\n\nThe Government’s December l6, 2o2o opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion\ndetails the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference\nherein. (See Dkt. No. loo at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol6l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020162.jpg": "Cased 2o-o8, CoG3onAeIN 3SH6cOMent4G5i , BilEGH3lo9/a he Ragef a Ob 9\nPage 2\n\nbail in July 2o2o, the defendant filed a renewed motion for release in December 2o2o in which the\ndefendant proposed a “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that “either were\nmade at the initial bail hearing or could have been made then.” (Dec. Op. at l). In denying that\nsecond application, the Court found that the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only\nsolidifies the Court’s view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>\nof conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d. at l-2).\n\nOn January ll, 2o2l, the defendant filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit appealing\nthe Court’s December 2o2o opinion denying the Second Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. ll3). That appeal\nis pending; the defendant has not yet filed her brief in support of the appeal.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the defendant submited the Third Bail Motion, in which she\nproposed two additional bail conditions to “supplement the . . . bail package she has already\noffered” in the Second Bail Motion (Mot. at 2): (l) renunciation of the defendant’s French and\nBritish citizenship; and (2) placement of a portion of her and her spouse’s assets in a new account\nto be overseen by an asset monitor.\n\nIl. The Court Does Not Have Jurisdiction to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of\nthe Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal\n\nThe defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the\nproposed conditions.” (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant asks the Court to consider the\nexact same package previously considered and rejected in the December opinion, as nou\n“supplement[ed]” by two additional conditions. (/d. at 2,8). Houever, the Court lacks jurisdiction\nto grant the Motion by virtue of the defendant’s appeal of the Court’s prior ruling to the Second\nCircuit.\n\n“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional\nsignificance—it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its\ncontrol over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’” United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d\n247, 25l (2d Cir. l996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, 58 (l982)).\n“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted rule rooted in the interest of judicial\neconomy, designed ‘to avoid confusion or waste of time resulting from having the same issues\nbefore two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l (quoting United States v. Salerno,\n868 F.2d 524, 54o (2d Cir. l989)); see also United States v. Ransom, 866 F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.\nl989) (describing the Griggs rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct of business in both the trial\nand appellate courts”).\n\nIn January 2o2l, the defendant filed an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2o2o\nOpinion and Order denying her Second Bail Motion. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion not only\nseeks reconsideration of the very issue presently on appeal but does so by proposing two additional\nbail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the defendant’s Second Bail Motion,\n(Mot. at 2, 8), a package which this Court considered and concluded could not “reasonably assure\nher appearance.” (Dec. Op. at l6). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail Motion also concerns\nbail and is thus an “aspect[] of the case involved in the appeal.” Rodgers, lol F.3d at 25l.

NATHAN, District Judge:\nDefendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy\nto entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; enticing a\nminor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy\nto transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l; transporting\nminors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges\nof perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.\nOn July l4, 2o2o, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant\nwas a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions would ensure her\nappearance. It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2o2o, the Defendant filed a renewed\nmotion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December\nl4, 2o2o. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2o2o, the Court denied that motion, concluding that\nthe Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could ensure her\nappearance.

Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship,\nand she also proposes to have her and her spouse’s assets placed in a new account that will be\nmonitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. l6o at 2.\n\nAs set forth belou, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant’s new arguments and\nproposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the\nsame reasons that the Court denied the Defendant’s first and second motions for release, the\nCourt DENIES the Defendant’s third motion for release on bail.\n\nl. Background\n\nOn July l4, 2o2o, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.\nAfter a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the factors set forth in\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could\nreasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a\nflight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l). The\nDefendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time.\n\nThe Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2o2o. The Court\nagain denied the Defendant’s motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the\nDefendant’s new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of\nflight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry\nlengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government,\nincluding multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant’s\nsubstantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol93", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020194.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN A6tuPMheht/LOP l Filecsas2 2729 ePageBlGhl2\nescape; and that the Defendant’s lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations\nraised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court.\nSee Dkt. No. lo6.\n\nOn February 23, 2o2l, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No.\nl6o (“Def. Mot.”). The Government opposed the Defendant’s motion on March 9, 2o2l. Dkt.\nNo. l65 (“Gov’t Opp’n’”). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March l6,\n2o2l.\n\nI. Legal Standard\n\nThe parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from\ngranting the Defendant’s third bail motion while Defendant’s bail appeal is pending. See Gov’t\nOpp’n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, lol F.3d 247, 25l (2d Cir. l996)\n(“As a general mater, ‘the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—\nit confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over\nthose aspects of the case involved in the appeal.’”) (citation omited). Under Rule 37(a) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure, houever, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer\nconsidering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court\nof appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P.\n37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant’s motion, it does not resolve the question of\nwhether it would have jurisdiction to grant it.\n\nPretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution and under the Bail Reform Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l4l, et seg. The Bail Reform Act\nrequires that a court release a defendant “subject to the least restrictive further condition, or\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol94", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020195.jpg": "CaSasb: 2o-8o o88oHAEN At uPAheht/LOP l Filecsas22F2Ig ePage 4l6l2\nperson as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(c)(l)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after\nconsidering the factors set forth in l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(g), the Court concludes that “no condition\nor <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and\nthe safety of any other person and the community.” l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e)(l).\n\nAfter a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can\nreasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allous the\nCourt to reopen the bail hearing if “information exists that was not knoun to the movant at the\ntime of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue” of whether pretrial detention is\nwarranted. l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(f). The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new\ninformation would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No.\nl8-CR-2o4l (NGG) (VMS), 2ol8 WL 63442o2, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2ol8) (noting that\n“(a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another”); United States v.\nHavens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing\nbecause the new information would not have changed the court’s decision to detain the defendant\nuntil trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its oun decision pursuant to its inherent\nauthority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3l42(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Roue, No. o2-CR-756 (LMM), 2oo3 WL 2ll96846, at *l (S.D.N.Y. May 2l, 2oo3)\n(noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on\nreconsideration was knoun to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); United States v.\nPetrov, No. l5-CR-66 (LTS), 2ol5 WL llo22886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

In such circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a\nlimited burden of production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that\nhe does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.”” United States v.

Discussion\nThe Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court’s inherent pouers to review\nits oun bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of\nthe Court’s earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the\nGovernment’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions,\nwhich are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2ol96", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020201.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4ATNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Padgeol d Ob l2\nparallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition\nwaiver. See Dec. Op. at l2-l3.\n\nSimilar doubts exist as to the Defendant’s offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The\nCourt is persuaded by the Government’s arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce\nher UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See\nGov’t Opp’n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the\nproposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court’s concerns regarding the\nDefendant’s ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition atempts. The\npossibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the\nDefendant’s incentive to flee.\n\nTo summarize, the Defendant’s willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship\ndoes not sufficiently assuage the Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant\nposes. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the\nrenunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court’s assessment of\nwhether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C lo-oo547 (SD,\n2olo WL 5387757, at *9 n.ll (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2o, 2olo). And that same uncertainty—and the\npossibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes\nflight, particularly because of the Defendant’s substantial international ties.\n\nNor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court’s determination that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The\nDefendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial\naffairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve\ndisbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2ol", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020202.jpg": "CaSede2ol ep) o33o4AUNt Dib cute l682 lFikeG 83222 /249 Plageoct l Ob l2\nconcerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant’s assets have been disclosed in light of\nthe lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of\nresolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it\naccounts for all of the Defendant’s and her spouse’s assets. See Dec. Op. at l6-l7.\n\nThe monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant’s future appearance,\neven when viewed in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> with the rest of the Defendant’s bail package. The Defendant\nwould continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to\nevade prosecution. These include the $45o,ooo that the Defendant would retain for living\nexpenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry\nand other chatels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at\n5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the\nDefendant’s total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate\nflight. When combined with the Court’s weighing of the § 3l42(g) factors and the presumption\nof detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its\nconclusion that no <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance.\n\nIf the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the\nDefendant’s future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package\nis substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again\ndetermines that “no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions will reasonably assure the\nappearance of” the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. l8 U.S.C. §\n3l42(e)(l).\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o2o2", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020209.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesuteAtl BO l FROG O22o6/2agAagect H6l6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff,\nNo. l7-CR-o2949-MV-l\n\nv.\n\nDASHAWN ROBERTSON,\nDefendant.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nTHIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to\nReconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release.

Doc. 298.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMr. Robertson is charged in a three-count superseding indictment with Obstruction of\nJustice by Retaliating Against a Witness, Victim, or Informant, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n§ l5l3(a)(l)(B); Possessing and Discharging a Firearm in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence, in\nviolation of l8 U.S.C. § 924(c); and Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Ammunition, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(l) and 924. Doc. 86. The charges arise from his alleged act of shooting\nan individual named D.S. eight times in the early morning hours of September l2, 2ol7 in\nretaliation for D.S.’s cooperation with the federal government in a criminal case two years earlier.\nSee Doc. 38 at 2. Mr. Robertson pled not guilty to the charges at an arraignment held on December\nll, 2ol7 [Doc. 9] and a trial in the case will be set for April 5, 2o2l, about two months from today.\n\nAlthough presumed innocent of all charges, Mr. Robertson has been in pretrial detention\nin this case for over three years. He was arrested on December ll, 2ol7 and was ordered detained\nthe same day by Magistrate Judge B. Paul Briones after the Magistrate Judge found that no\ncondition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions of release would reasonably assure the safety of the\ncommunity or his appearance in court. Doc. l2. Extensive pretrial litigation folloued until the\ncase was eventually ready and set for trial on March 23, 2o2o. Doc. 63. The Court held a pretrial\nconference on March lo, 2o2o and testimonial writs were issued. Docs. l27 and l43. Just days\nlater, houever, the devastating extent of the global COVID-l9 pandemic became clear and the\nChief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico suspended all civil\nand criminal jury trials set for the follouing month.

The government bears the burden of proving flight risk by\na preponderance of the evidence and dangerousness to any other person or the community by clear\nand convincing evidence. United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 6lo, 6l6 (loth Cir. 2oo3). A district\ncourt’s review of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is de novo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at\n6l6.\n\nSection 3l42(e)(2) creates a rebutable presumption that no condition or combinations of\nconditions exist to reasonably assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community\nwhere there is probable cause to believe the defendant violated l8 U.S.C. § 924(c). See l8 U.S.C.\n§ 3l42(e)(3)(B). As the Tenth Circuit has held:\n\nOnce the presumption is invoked, the burden of production shifts to the defendant.\n\nHouever, the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to the\n\ncommunity always remains with the government. The defendant’s burden of\n\nproduction is not heavy, but some evidence must be produced. Even if a\n\ndefendant’s burden of production is met, the presumption remains a factor for\n\nconsideration by the district court in determining whether to release or detain.\nUnited States v. Stricklin, 932 F.2d l353, l354-55 (loth Cir. l99l).\n\nHere, although Mr. Robertson is subject to a presumption of detention due to his § 924(c)\ncharge, see Doc. 86 at l—2, the Court finds that he has successfully rebuted the presumption. He\nhas produced evidence, for example, that he is not a danger to the community nor a flight risk\nbecause he voluntarily turned himself in on the instant offense, despite consistently maintaining\nhis innocence and knouing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at\n5. He has also produced evidence that he will not flee the jurisdiction due to his family’s presence\nhere. Jd. And he has produced evidence that his placement at La Pasada Halfway House is a\ncondition of release that could reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l5", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020216.jpg": "Cass4 27-o8,o284orMMt DoesutPAt BO l FROG o22o6 /2agFages8 6l6\nDoc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebuted the presumption\nin § 3l42(e)(3)(B) that no condition or <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions could meet the requirements for\nhis release.\n\nSection 3l42(g) then lays out the follouing factors for courts to consider: (l) the nature\nand circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a\nviolation of § l59l, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled\nsubstance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device; (2) the weight of the evidence against the\ndefendant; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness\nof the danger to any person or community that would be posed by the defendant’s release. l8\nU.S.C. § 3l42(g).\n\nThe Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,\nthey do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the\nnature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.\nRobertson allegedly shooting a victim, D.S., in retaliation for his cooperation with the government\nin an earlier criminal case. As the Court stated at the November 4, 2o2l pretrial conference, it\ntakes Mr. Robertson’s charges extremely seriously because the ability of witnesses to come\nforward and safely provide information to the government, and to the Court, is at the core of our\ncriminal justice system.\n\nWith regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one\nhand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other\nwitness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior\nto the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and\nplace of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o2l6", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020219.jpg": "Cdsest P7-creo 2axtauivient DecuMdl BA62 Filke662o6/Phg Peoye dill66l6\n<span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of conditions, that will reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety\nof any person and the community. His pretrial release is therefore required by l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(e).\n\nlil. Mr. Robertson’s Release is Necessary for the Preparation of His Trial Defense\nUnder l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i).\n\nThe Court additionally finds that Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation\nof his trial defense under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i). That section allous a judicial officer who issued an\norder of detention to, by subsequent order, “permit the temporary release of the person, in the\ncustody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial\nofficer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for\nanother compelling reason.” § 3l42(i).2 The defendant bears the burden of establishing their\nentitlement to temporary release under § 3l42(i). United States v. Clark, 448 F. Supp. 3d ll52,\nll55 (D. Kan. 2o2o) (citation omited). Courts considering whether pretrial release is necessary\nfor the preparation of the person’s defense have considered: “(l) [the] time and opportunity the\ndefendant has to prepare for the trial and to participate in his defense; (2) the complexity of the\ncase and volume of information; and (3) expense and inconvenience associated with preparing\nwhile incarcerated.” United States v. Boatwright, ---F. Supp. 3d---, No. 2:l9-CR-oo3ol-GMN-\nDJA, 2o2o WL l639855, at *4 (D. Nev. Apr. 2, 2o2o) (unreported) (citations omited).\n\nHere, all of those factors weigh in favor of release. Because Mr. Robertson’s trial will be\nreset for April 5, 2o2l, he and his defense team have only two months left to prepare.\n> While the Court recognizes that Magistrate Judge Briones is the judicial officer that issued Mr.\nRobertson’s initial order of detention, this mater is before the Court on Mr. Robertson’s request that the\nCourt review that detention order under l8 U.S.C. § 3l45(b). See Doc. 274 at l. The Tenth Circuit has not\nyet ruled on whether a request for temporary release under l8 U.S.C. § 3l42(i) can only be decided by the\nMagistrate Judge that issued the initial order of detention. See United States v. Alderete, 336 F.R.D. 24o,\n268 (D.N.M. 2o2o). But at least one other federal district court has recently considered and granted pretrial\nrelease under that section. See United States v. Stephens, 447 F.

Judge Nathan emphasized that Maxwell’s\n“natern of providing incomplete or erroneous information to the Court or to Pretrial\nServices bears significantly’ on her assessment of Maxwell’s history and\ncharacteristics.

Accordingly, this Court refuses the Defendant’s invitation to expand this “strictly\nlimited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.\n\nSecond, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the\nvoir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 5o’s personal experience is not so\nsimilar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it\nsufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that\nJuror 5o’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 5o was sexually\nabused as a minor on multiple occasions by “two people who were friends”—his stepbrother,\nwho was “someone familiar to him . . . who was part of his life,” and the stepbrother’s friend.\nMaxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 4. He also delayed reporting the abuse. /d. But the Defendant\noverlooks the important differences. Juror 5o was younger—ages 9 and lo—than the victims\ntestified they were when they were abused by the Defendant and Epstein. He disclosed his abuse\nto his mother in high school, unlike the victims here. And unlike the period of two years of\nabuse that Juror 5o endured, some of the trial witnesses testified about several years of abuse.\nLike Juror A and Juror B, the Court would not have implied or inferred bias if Juror 5o had\ndisclosed his experience during jury selection. The Court would have asked appropriate follou-\nup questions proffered by counsel and determined based on the juror’s answers to those\nquestions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.\n\nJuror 5o is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by\nthe Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.\nUnited States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a\nvariety of issues. 724 F.3d at l6l.

Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros\nmemo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.\nIt has come to my atention that you led the agents to believe that\nthe indictment of this mater was a foregone conclusion and that our\ndecision to put off that date and listen to the defense atorneys’\nconcerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about\nindicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization\nby anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°\n\nIn the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with\n\nSanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:\nLilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It\nwas an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea\noffer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take\nto resolve the mater. As you are also well aware, the only reason\nwhy this office even agreed to look into the Epstein mater in the\nfirst instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an\nadequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the\nagents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that\nresulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI\nnor our office ever would have interceded. You should also knou\nthat my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US\nAtorney’s full knouledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in\npursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all\nthe interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.\nIn any event, I fail to see hou a discussion that went nouhere has\nhurt our bargaining position.

OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements. As the U.S. Atorney, Acosta had authority to proceed in this manner, but many of\nthe problems that developed with the NPA might have been avoided with a more thoughtful\napproach. As Acosta belatedly recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellou U.S. Atorney today, I\nwould say, think it through.””°?\n\nNo one of the individual problems discussed above necessarily demonstrates poor\njudgment by itself. Houever, in <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span>, the evidence shous that the state-based resolution\nwas ill conceived from the start and that the NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making process.\nFrom the time the USAO opened its investigation, Acosta recognized the federal interest in\nprosecuting Epstein, yet after that investigation had run for more than a year, he set the\ninvestigation on a path not originally contemplated. Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l387", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021570.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o39, Pagel4o of 2l7\n29\nM6SOmaxl\nl THE COURT: It's not dated November 2oo4; am I right?\n2 It's on a page that has dates surrounding it of December,\n3 November.\n4 MS.

OPR did not find evidence indicating that such a\nmeeting or discussion with the full team was held before the decision was made to pursue the\nstate-based resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term of incarceration, or\nbefore the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and told OPR,\n“And a question that I think is a valid one in my mind is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done\nand get a jail term, mean that we didn’t take a step back and say, let’s evaluate hou this train is\nmoving?”\n\nMany features of the NPA were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions\nlike the term of incarceration and sexual offender registration, with the result that Epstein was able\nto manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his senior staff held differing opinions about\nsome of the issues that Acosta felt were important and that factored into his decision-making.\nThere does not seem to be a point, houever, at which those differing opinions were considered\nwhen forming a strategy; rather, Acosta seems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him\nfolloued and atempted to implement but without a considered strategy beyond ataining the three\ncore elements.

Having done so, he had responsibility for\nensuring that he received and considered all of the necessary information before puting an end to\na federal investigation into serious criminal conduct. Acosta’s failure to adequately consider the\nfull ramifications of the NPA contributed to a process and ultimately a result that left not only the\nline AUSA and the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also caused victims and the public to question\nthe motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable measure of justice was achieved.\nAccordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he chose a course of\naction that was in marked contrast to the action that the Department would reasonably expect an\natorney exercising good judgment to take.\n\n259 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s atorney acknouledged that “[t]he mater would have\nbenefited from more consistent staffing and atention.”\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23225", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023364.jpg": "cause of death was hanging and the manner of death Epstein to make an unmonitored telephone call the\nwas suicide.

As described in greater detail in Chapter 2, inmate counts and 3o-minute rounds are two\nmeans by which the BOP accounts for inmates and assesses their safety, security, and well-being. BOP and\nMCC New York policies require that staff members count all inmates in each housing unit within the facility\nat designated times each day. Additionally, BOP and MCC New York policies require that a staff member\nobserve all SHU inmates at least once during the first 3o minutes of each hour (e.g., l2 a.m. to l2:3o a.m.)\nand again during the second 3o minutes of the hour (e.g., l2:3o a.m. to l a.m.), thus ensuring that inmates\nare observed at least twice per hour. BOP staff are required to document inmate counts and 3o-minute\nrounds on official BOP forms, which are often referred to as “count slips” and “round sheets.”\nDuring the OIG's investigation, the OIG obtained information that the staff assigned to the MCC New York\nSHU did not conduct any counts of inmates within the SHU from August 9, 2ol9, at approximately 4 p.m.,\nuntil Epstein was found hanged in his cell on the morning of August lo, 2ol9.

Again, houever, SHU staff on duty during that period had falsely certified in\nthe round sheet that the required rounds were conducted.

Additionally, none of the l5 inmates who agreed to be interviewed in connection with this\ninvestigation, lo of whom were housed in the SHU on August 9 and lo, had any credible information\nsuggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide. Further, the SHU staff and the\nthree interviewed inmates with a direct line of sight to the door of Epstein’s cell from their cells stated that\nno one entered or exited Epstein’s cell after the SHU staff returned Epstein to his cell on the evening of\nAugust 9, which is consistent with the security measures in place within the MCC New York SHU. SHU staff\ntold the OIG that at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9, all SHU inmates were locked in their cells for the\nevening and that there was no indication that any of the other inmates could have goten out of their cells.\nAdditionally, the OIG analyzed the available recorded video of the SHU, which was limited to the common\narea of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station, due to the MCC New York security camera system's\nrecording issues that we detail in this report.

Conclusions\nOur investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of\nJeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional\nCenter located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate\ncounts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which\ncompromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,\nwe found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,\namong other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate\ncounts and 3o-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special\nHousing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.\nWe further found that multiple BOP employees submited false documents claiming that they had\nperformed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor\nwhen questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York\nemployees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to\ntheir conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York\nsubsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court\ndismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their\nagreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for\nother MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-lo, 2ol9, who the OIG found also\ncreated, certified, and submited false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day\nbefore and the day of Epstein’s death.\nThe OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive\nthat Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor alloued Epstein to make an\nunmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.\nThe OIG determined that the <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and\nunmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately lo:4o p.m. on\nAugust 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:3o a.m. the follouing day.\nAdditionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability\nof MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed belou, we make a number of\nrecommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation\nand review.\nWhile the OIG determined that MCC New York staff commited significant violations of BOP and MCC\nNew York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did\nnot uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding\nthe absence of criminality in connection with hou Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were\ninterviewed by the OIG said they did not knou of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death\nwas something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible\ninformation that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.\n94\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2346l", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023465.jpg": "The <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in this\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life, resulting in significant questions being asked\nabout the circumstances of his death, hou it could have been alloued to have happen, and most\nimportantly, depriving his numerous victims, many of whom were underage girls at the time of the alleged\ncrimes, of their ability to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures have\nbeen recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and\nrelated problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to the BOP for appropriate action.\nUnless otherwise noted, the OIG applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining\nwhether DOJ personnel have commited misconduct.

MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as\n\nInstructed by the Psychology Department on July 3o\nOn July 3o, 2ol9, the MCC New York Psychology Department sent an email to over 7o BOP staff members\nstating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's\ndirective that Epstein have an appropriate cellmate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2ol9,\nwhen Epstein was found lying on the floor of his cell with a piece of orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s\ncellmate at the time (Inmate l) told MCC New York staff that Epstein had tried to hang himself, and another\ninmate housed on the same SHU tier at the time (Inmate 2) corroborated several aspects of Inmate l's\naccount. Epstein’s accounts of what had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he\nthought his cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not knou what had\noccurred. Epstein later asked two different MCC New York staff members if he could be housed with the\nsame cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to harm him.\nAs a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and then psychological observation.\nConsistent with the Psychology Department's directive, the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant each told the\nOIG that they verbally informed SHU staff of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. These and other witnesses\nsaid staff members regularly assigned to the SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. Houever,\ndespite the Psychology Department's widely disseminated July 3o email instruction and the subsequent\nverbal direction provided by the Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left without a cellmate on\nAugust 9 and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by suicide.\nl. Failure to Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein a\nNew Cellmate\nThe OIG's investigation and review revealed that on August 9, 2ol9, MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nfailed to notify their superiors that Epstein’s cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York\nand therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required\nnotifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further belou—\n98\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23465", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023490.jpg": "other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier\ndates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.\n\no MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully\nFunctional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to\nensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review\nrevealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although\nvideo cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies\nresulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to\nnot record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.\n\ne Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing\noperational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and\nsecurely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing\ninmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,\nand widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during\nthis investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most\nhigh profile inmates.\n\ne No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with\nEpstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP\npersonnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal\nconduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s\ndeath and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined\nMCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not\nuncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in\nconnection with Epstein’s death.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was provided with the opportunity to take his oun life.

The fact that these failures\nhave been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for\nDO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.\nThe DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional\ninstitutions.

On August lo, 2ol9, Epstein was found hanged in his locked\ncell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The New York City’s Office of the Chief Medical\nExaminer determined that Epstein died by suicide.\nToday's report follous numerous other OIG reports, unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified\nlong-standing operational challenges at the BOP that negatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely\nand securely. Today's report identified many of these same operational challenges, including significant job\nperformance and management failures on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard of BOP policies;\nand deficiencies with the BOP’s staffing levels; security camera systems; and custody and care of inmates at\nrisk for suicide.\nFor example, we determined that MCC New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was assigned a cellmate as\ninstructed by MCC New York’s Psychology Department follouing an incident on July 23\" where Epstein was\nfound unresponsive in his cell with a cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we concluded that MCC\nNew York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were\naccounted for and safe in their cells, such as inmate counts and rounds, and searches of cells. Had Epstein's\ncell been searched as required, it would have revealed that Epstein had excess prison blankets, linens, and\nclothing in his cell. MCC New York staff also failed to ensure that the institution's security camera system\nwas fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.\nWhile we determined MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence\ncontradicting the FBI's determination that there was no criminality in connection with hou Epstein died.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">combination</span> of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in today’s\nreport all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s\ncustody was left unmonitored and alone in his cell with an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him\nwith the opportunity to take his oun life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not\nadequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the\ncircumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous victims of the\nopportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that these chronic problems and failures have been recurring ones does not excuse them, and\ngives additional urgency to the need for DOJ and BOP leadership to address them.\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23492", "../epstein_files/Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00024825.jpg": "Page 287 |\ndid not return from court.
