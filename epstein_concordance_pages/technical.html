Rather than\nrepeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our leter to the MDC warden, dated\nOctober 29, 2o2o, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of\nconfinement.’ These include:\n\n« De Facto Solitary Confinement\n\n= Excessive Surveillance\n\n= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching\n\n« Deprivation of Food\n\n= Deprivation of Sleep\n\n# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends\n\n= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel\nThe conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are uterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate\nfor a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a\nquarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous\noccasions. As we advised the Court in our leter of October 23, 2o2o, defense counsel first\n'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not\nreceived any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is\nthe highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is\nbeing constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever\nreleased from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.\n\n2 The Warden never responded to the leter.

In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which were produced after the defense\nalerted the government to these problems, contained some of the same <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> problems and\nincluded a significant number of unreadable documents.

As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine. On\nNovember l8, 2o2o, Ms. Maxwell was given a COVID test and placed in l4-day quarantine due\nto contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving team of guards assigned to Ms.\nMaxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their oun COVID outbreaks,\nheightens her exposure to the virus.

The constant\nstrip searching, touch wanding, and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for\nexposure to COVID-l9.\n\n'3 On November l8, 2o2o, the government, at our request, provided a laptop computer to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC,\nwhich it believed would remedy the issues with unreadable documents, and has agreed to provide a new hard drive\ncontaining all of the discovery. It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> problems.

Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span>\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives.

The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine.

When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooooll76\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001355.jpg": "_ Caesesb:2o-cl/ oo88o4o st BOcument 4/29 2 Filed/o27/o4/PagPage fat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool355\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001392.jpg": "Castas2olcr-oo3BoAuNEnDoCuite hP 2o2 l FAeaMeBS5RagePags 4of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading.

(Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material.

That |\nelement asks whether “the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.”\nDuren, 439 U.S. at 364. Here, Schulte alleges that African American and Hispanic American |\njurors were unlawfully excluded from the jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 7.) These groups have\nbeen recognized as “distinctive” by the Second Circuit. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (“Rioux has\nsatisfied the first prong of the Duren test: Blacks and Hispanics are unquestionably “distinctive”\ngroups for the purposes of a fair-cross-section analysis.”); United States v. Barnes, 52o F.\nSupp.2d 5lo, 5l4 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7). Schulte has therefore satisfied the first element under\nDuren. The Court holds, houever, that Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements of\nthe Duren test. Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge must be rejected.\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2828\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002838.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOnouraiehd Fiebda22ePl Pafad¢? bf 26 2o\nalleged exclusion here (e.g. people moving) is an external force.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658. |\nAccordingly, this argument must be rejected under Rioux.\" See id. |\nIn sum, Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements under Duren.\nAccordingly, his fair cross-section challenge under the Sixth Amendment and J SSA must be\nrejected. |\ni. Equal Protection Challenge :\nSchulte next contends that the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic\nAmerican jurors violates the Equal Protection clause under the Fifth Amendment. (Schulte Br. at | |\nl6-l7.) As noted above, the Equal Protection clause forbids the exclusion of racial minorities\nfrom grand and petit juries. Castaneda, 43o U.S. at 492. But to establish a prima facie violation\nof equal protection, Schulte must furnish “proof of discriminatory intent.” United States v.\nBiaggi, 9o9 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. l99o). Because Schulte cannot make such a shouing, his 2\nEqual Protection challenge fails. His only contention on this element is that the\nunderrepresentation of African Americans and Hispanic Americans “cannot be the result of\n° Under New York law, voters are designated “inactive” when a “County Board received\ninformation indicating that a voter may no longer be living at her address of registration.”\n\n- Common Cause/New York v. Brehm, 432 F. Supp.3d 285, 29o (S.D.N.Y. 2o2o) (examining New\nYork voting law). |\nlo The Court is unpersuaded by Schulte’s remaining allegations of systematic exclusion, which\nare that (l) jurors drawn from the overlapping counties were inequitably prorated between the :\ntwo courthouses, and (2) a <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> glitch in the White Plains master wheel excluded jurors who )\nhad provided an alternative address when registering to vote. As to the former claim, Schulte has\nnot shoun that this alleged error caused the underrepresentation at issue. See Allen, 2o2l WL |\n43l458, at *ll (finding same error to have had “minimal” effect on venires). And as to the later |\nclaim, the parties concede that this glitch actually augmented, not diminished, African American\nand Hispanic American representation in the White Plains master wheel. (Gov't Opp. Br. at l7.)\n\nAccordingly, these allegations do not satisfy the third prong under Duren.\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2838\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002839.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads £8 26 2o\n\nchance.” (Schulte Br. at l7.) But the Court will not assume or infer that this District has been\noperating under an intentionally discriminatory Jury Plan since 2oo9. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 659 :\n(rejecting Equal Protection challenge due to lack of evidence shouing intentional\ndiscrimination). Therefore, the Defendant’s Equal Protection claim must be rejected.\nTH. JSSA\nSchulte’s remaining claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on these claims, he must |\ndemonstrate a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions. LaChance, 788 F.2d\nat 87o, “Mere <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> violations of the procedures prescribed by the Act do not constitute :\nsubstantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. (cleaned up). The criteria for\ndifferentiating between a substantial and <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> error turns on the “nature and extent of its |\neffects[.]” Id. The Court holds that Schulte cannot demonstrate a substantial failure to comply |\nwith the JSSA and that his statutory claims must therefore be rejected.” :\nAs an initial mater, Schulte repleads his Sixth Amendment fair cross-section challenge\n\nunder the ISSA. (Schulte Br. at l9.) But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section\nchallenges brought under both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA, this claim must be dismissed :\nfor the reasons stated above. See supra ‘7-l7. |\nApart from his fair cross-section challenge, Schulte also contends that the follouing :\ndefects constitute substantial violations of the JSSA: (l) the Government’s decision to seek the |\nIndictment from White Plains and not Manhatan; (2) the exclusion of inactive voters from :\ncertain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the allegedly erroneous proration of jurors ,\n'l To be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic exclusion\nprong of the Sixth Amendment analysis. See supra l5-l7. But because Schulte pleads these |\ndefects as separate violations of the JSSA, the Court conducts a separate analysis here. |\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2839\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002840.jpg": "CaGase2o-rr-oo8864oAPAC DOuouRraiehd Fieebda22ePl PaRads 8 Bf 2o\nfrom the counties that overlap both courthouses; and (4) the clerical error by which voters who\nhad registered with an alternate mailing address were excluded from jury selection. (Schulte Br.\nat l9 -- 22; Schulte Reply at ll-l5.) For the follouing reasons, the Court concludes that these :\nallegations do not offend the JSSA.\n\nThe Government’s Decision. The Government’s appropriate decision to seek the |\nIndictment in White Plains was entirely proper and in accordance with the Constitution, JSSA, |\nand customary practice. See supra ll-l3. Accordingly, this prosecutorial decision cannot be |\nsaid to contravene the JSSA. |\n\nExclusion of Inactive Voters. In United States v. Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *lo, Judge ,\nRoman addressed the issue of whether the exclusion of inactive voters from certain counties used :\nby White Plains violated the ISSA. See id. Judge Roman concluded that the exclusion did not, |\nreasoning that it is “entirely logical for a jury selection process to exclude individuals who have\nsince moved,” see id., and even if it did, that the defect was merely a “<span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> violation” of the :\nJSSA. Id. Because the Court agrees with this reasoning on all counts, it concludes that the\nexclusion of inactive voters here does not violate the JSSA.\n\nErroneous Proration & Alternate Mailing Address. Lastiy, Schulte argues that |\nprospective jurors from the overlapping counties of Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland were\nincorrectly prorated between the two courthouses, and that a <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> glitch inadvertently\nexcluded jurors who had registered to vote with alternate mailing addresses. (Schulte Br, at 2l—\n22; Schulte Reply at l3-l4.) The Court is unpersuaded. As to the former contention, Schulte\ndoes not explain hou the alleged proration error constitutes a “substantial” violation of the JSSA, |\nespecially where its “effect” appears to be “minimal.” Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *ll (rejecting\nthe same argument on the basis that it was merely a “<span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> violation of the ISSA”). As to the :\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo284o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002841.jpg": "CaGade2o-rr-oo2854oAPAC DOnourTai8hd Fikedd22eLl PaRage 26 2o 2o\n\nJater point, it is undisputed that the alternate mailing address defect actually led to an increase of\nrepresentation of the very minority groups that Schulte contends were underrepresented, (Gov’t _\nOpp. Br. at l7.) Thus empiricism precludes the notion that the violation was “substantial” in\nnature. LaChance, 788 F.2d at 87o (explaining that the inquiry for whether a violation is |\nsubstantial is the “extent of its effect on the wheels”); see also Allen, 2o2l WL 43l458, at *ll |\n(rejecting same argument on the ground that it was merely a <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> violation). In sum, the\nCourt concludes that Schulte has not demonstrated a plausible violation of the JSSA. :\nFor the forgoing reasons, the motion to dismiss is DENIED. !\nDated: New York, New York SO ORDERED i\nMarch 24, 2o2l\nPAUL A.

But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education <span class=\"highlight\">Technical</span> Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3688\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003949.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page 7 of lo\nPage 7\nat trial. Simply put, the defense does not need to investigate crimes with which the defendant is\nnot charged.\n\nMoreover, the defense’s most recent leter refers to these materials as somehou\nconstituting Brady material without any explanation of what information within the most recent\nproduction is supposedly exculpatory. But given that, as noted above, a significant majority of the\nnon-testifying witness materials do not reference the defendant, to the extent the defense is\nsuggesting that the existence of victims who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein without assistance\nfrom the defendant constitutes Brady material, the Government has repeatedly noted that such\nevidence is not exculpatory.

Regardless, the defense has ample time to review these materials in advance of\ntrial, and the Government intended to produce all of these materials to the defense with or without\na superseding indictment.* Thus, the defense would have needed to review and investigate these\nmaterials even if the Government never obtained the S2 Indictment.

Indeed, in November 2o2o, the undersigned\nhand delivered a laptop and discovery production to the MDC for the defendant, and the\nGovernment understands the defendant received those items that same day.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span>,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

That is all that is required, and the defendant cannot leverage the notice\nrequirements of Rule 4o4(b) to preclude this evidence at trial. Indeed, the “Second Circuit\ngenerally disfavors the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence on <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> grounds.” Hart v.\nBHH, LLC, No. l5 Civ. 48o4 (WHP), 2ol9 WL l494o27, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 4, 2ol9) (citing\nRodriguez v. Vill. Green Realty, Inc., 788 F.3d 3l, 47 (2d Cir. 2ol5)). Accordingly, the only judge\nin this District to consider a similar situation concluded that the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice\nwas sufficient in combination with the Government’s motion papers. See United States v.\nChandler, No. l9 Cr. 867 (PKC), 2o2l WL l85l996, at *2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May lo, 2o2l).\n\nThe defense vaguely asserts that it cannot perform an independent investigation into the\nRule 4o4(b) evidence due to the inadequacy of the Government’s notice. (Def. Mot. 2 at 5-6).\nThat conclusory assertion cannot support a motion to preclude the jury from hearing evidence of\nthe defendant’s guilt. The defense has not identified any specific way that they have been hampered\n\n4o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 43\n974 N.

Another important issue is to investigate what sort\nof training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-\nety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed\nassessment methods.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addi-\ntion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or\nis occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about\nkey issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error\nrates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false\npositives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that\nought to be used in forensic setings as it does not meet some of the cri-\nteria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court\nan expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span>,\nor other specialized knouledge will help the trier of fact to understand the\nevidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-\ncient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and\nmethods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-\nods to the facts of the case” (Rule 7o2: Testimony by expert witness). Right\nnou it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and\nmethods” to define and detect grooming.\n\nWe propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-\npropriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this\ninappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual\nabuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.\nFuture research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were\ncollected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.\nThis would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and beter under-\nstood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic\nsetings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-\nmetric instruments with knoun reliability and validity to assess grooming\naccording to this standard.\n\nREFERENCES\nl8 USC § 2252A.

A court violates a defendant’s right to present a defense when it excludes competent and\nreliable evidence that is central to the defense. See Crane, 476 U.S. at 69o. The exclusion of such\nevidence “deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor’s case encounter and\n‘survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.’” /d. at 69o-9l (quoting United States v.\nCronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656 (l984)).\n\nThe Constitution also affords Ms. Maxwell the right to confront her accusers. U.S.\namend. VI; Olden v. Kentucky, 488 U.S. 227, 23l (l988). “[A] criminal defendant states a\nviolation of the Confrontation Clause by shouing that [she] was prohibited from engaging in\notherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to shou a prototypical form of bias on the part\nof the witness, and thereby ‘to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could\nappropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.’” Delaware v.

See Jn re Mirena IUD Prod. Liab.

The first of these indices is whether “the core details” of an\naccusation remain constant over time. Jd. The second is that an alleged victim’s “emotional\ndistress [is not] predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation.” /d. at ll. And third, that victims\nof sexual assault “have higher rates of mental disorders,” which “can affect memory and recall.”\nId.

First, they have only\nmarginal relevance. At the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio made clear that when serving clients in\nher clinical capacity, she does not “go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical\nroom.” Nov. lo Tr. at l6.

He disclosed the abuse to his mother when he was in high school. His mother\ncalled the police and gave a report, but no charges were brought. /d. at 8-9.

Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23.

Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.° But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F. Supp.\n2d 445, 473 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2), vacated and remanded on other grounds, United States v. Parse,\n789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2ol5). The court granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial,\nemphasizing the “deliberate lies engineered to create a fictitious, ‘marketable’ juror” warranted\n“extraordinary relief.” Jd. at 468. Such is not the case here. The Court credits Juror 5o’s\nexplanation that his nondisclosure was an “inadvertent mistake,” not intentional deception.\nHearing Tr. at l4-l5. Juror 5o explained hou the circumstances surrounding his completion of\nthe questionnaire—including his recent romantic breakup, that he had no expectation of being\nselected, the <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues and ensuing long wait to begin the questionnaire, and the generally\ndistracting environment—resulted in his “skimming” the questionnaire and missing the personal\n8 The Defendant argued that these repeated lies included Juror 5o’s use of social media in her pre-hearing briefing.\nMaxwell Br. at 36.

Complaints made during trial regarding her\ninadequate daily nutrition were received as a nuisance rather than cause for concern and atention.\n\nAn extra blanket provided because of the cold temperature in her cell was removed on the\nclaim it had not been approved by the warden, only to be returned when guards observed Ms.\nMaxwell shaking while asleep and became concerned that she might be having a seizure. She was\ngiven limited time to exercise in an area without sunlight or fresh air, then constructively denied\nthe ability to exercise because she was not provided proper-fiting footwear.\n\nThe treatment imposed on Ms. Maxwell was unnecessarily and intentionally degrading and\nthreatening.

Puting aside the reason and propriety of dispensing this\nalarming information, the diminution of security concerns resulting in her transfer to general\npopulation appears correlated to Ms. Maxwell having been sufficiently safeguarded to fill\nEpstein’s empty seat — satisfying the concerns of the government, DOJ, BOP, MDC, prosecutors,\nCourt, and accusers.\n\nDeprived of sleep and adequate nutrition and subjected to such undignified and\ndehumanizing conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell was considerably weakened psychologically\nand had great difficulty concentrating, thwarting her ability to participate in and prepare her\ndefense.

Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and\ncompromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with\nnumerous unacceptable delays and <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> problems with the discovery that the government\nhas produced to her thus far.

As a result, Ms. Maxwell has\nnot had access to a complete set of readable discovery for over four months.’ Ms. Maxwell\ncannot defend herself if she cannot review the discovery.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Maxwell has had to endure the added burdens of quarantine.

It is too early to tell whether the new laptop and hard drive will solve all of the\n<span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> problems.

Defense counsel will\nalso be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense\nargument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—\na patently incorrect claim.\n\nThe defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the\nGovernment, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material\ndefense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents\nprovided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span>\ndifficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives.

The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because\nthe MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the\nlaptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC\npreviously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and\narranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would\nnot have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Nou that she is out of\nquarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo93\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020094.jpg": "Caseab2 o-6o 8BGANnt DEctIMert loo2 Filed6R2a38/?tHgPageBataf 36\n\nAs to the defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that\nthe defense complains of resulted from the defendant herself dropping the hard drive onto the\nground, and that drive has been replaced. When the defense informed the Government that the\ndrive containing the seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered to have\nIT staff review the drive. In response, the defense indicated the drive was in fact still viewable\nand declined to have IT staff review it. Accordingly, it is the Government’s understanding that\nthe defendant currently has a full, readable set of discovery at the MDC. At the defense’s request,\nthe Government is preparing yet another copy containing all productions to date on a single drive\nso that the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC.'! Throughout\nthe defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government has been responsive to the defense’s concerns\nregarding access to discovery and counsel. The Government will continue to work with MDC\nlegal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able to review her discovery and to communicate with\ndefense counsel over the seven months still remaining before trial.\n\nAs to the defense complaints regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the\ndefense notably does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in general population.\nIndeed, the defense appears to agree that the best way to ensure the defendant’s safety while\ndetained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in protective custody,\nhouever, the defendant is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has her oun\nshouer, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her oun phone to use, and has her oun\ntelevision. Those conditions set her far apart from general population inmates, not to mention\n'! On this score, the Government notes the tension between the defense claim that the discovery\nproduced to date contains litle of value or relevant to the charges set forth in the Indictment, and\nthe simultaneous claim that the defendant has been prejudiced by <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> difficulties that have\ntemporarily delayed her ability to review portions of those productions, productions which,\naccording to the defense, counsel have already been able to conclude are essentially unimportant.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2oo94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020272.jpg": "_ CaSede2oteb®d33ouAEnnt Dibeutrenvl2e lFiked 92ool /2agPiagef Lat 2\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s January 25, 2o2l\norder allouing the parties to respond to a leter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention\nCenter (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. ll7). In particular, MDC legal counsel\nasks the Court to vacate its January l5, 2o2l order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to\nuse a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no\nobjection to the defendant’s request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally\ndefers to the MDC regarding hou it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue\nto defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery\neven without laptop access on weekends and holidays.\n\nGiven the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the\nGovernment and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has\nextensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery\nproduction in August 2o2o, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in\nthe MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues\nreviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced\nreformated copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding hou to open particular files.\nBecause the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files\non the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in\nher review of discovery. On November l8, 2o2o, the Government hand delivered the laptop to\nthe MDC for the defendant’s exclusive use.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to\nreview her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the\ndefendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the\nMDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On\nweekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allou the defendant to use the BOP\ndesktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted\nabove, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant’s request for weekend access\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooo2o272\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020310.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tran S3osaTentDGcWArW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, 57Age Rage 3 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nThe defense has tried to streamline its review of the discovery even before the filing of\nsuperseding indictment by using term searches and key word searches. But given the nature of\nthe discovery, there are meaningful limits to what the defense can do to limit the number of\ndocuments it must re-review in light of the new charges. For example, the discovery contains\napproximately 2l4,ooo photographs, hundreds of hours of audio-visual files, and over 25o,ooo\ndocuments where the text is too poor to be OCR-searchable. Those materials are not susceptible\nto text searching and must be reviewed individually. Moreover, they must be reviewed with Ms.\nMaxwell to see if she recognizes the people in the photographs and videos. In light of the new\ncharges and the addition of Accuser-4, these must be re-reviewed, which will take weeks.\n\nWe have already experienced the difficulties of reviewing photographs with Ms.\nMaxwell. Over the past three days, defense counsel have been conducting an evidence view\nwith Ms. Maxwell. As part of that review, we have tried to use an FBI-supplied laptop and hard\ndrive to review approximately 2,loo “Highly Confidential” photographs that were not produced\nto us in discovery. Because of <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> issues with the laptop, we still have not completed the\nreview.\n\nThe re-review of the discovery will not be limited to the materials on the seized devices.\nThe discovery also includes numerous bank records and phone records that date from the 2ooos\nand later. None of these records were from the l99os and were therefore largely irrelevant to the\ncharged crimes. Houever, with the expansion of the charges to include the time period of the\n2ooos, the defense will need to carefully analyze these records for relevant payments and phone\ncalls, which will, again, take a significant amount of time.\n\nThe government also atempts to justify its delay in seeking the superseding indictment\ndue to the investigative challenges posed by COVID.

See Leo Sure Chief,\n438 F.3d at 923. The statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to\nprosecutions for offenses commited before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a\nnew limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that\nwould otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the\napplication of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct.\n\nCourts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language.\nThe Eighth Circuit has held that the l994 amendments to § 3283, which alloued prosecution of\nsex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See\nUnited States v. Jeffries, 4o5 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2oo5). The Second Circuit has observed\nthat the Higher Education <span class=\"highlight\">Technical</span> Amendments of l99l, Pub. L. No. lo2-26, lo5 Stat. l23,\nillustrates language that requires a statute’s application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg.\nAcceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 39l F.3d at 4o7. That statute eliminated the statute of\nlimitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “no limitation shall terminate the\nperiod within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.\n\nThe history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent to apply the extended limitations period\nas broadly as the Constitution allous. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress\nfurther extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children “may be\ndifficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020953.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel27 of 22l\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page lo of 4o\nlimited approach proposed by the Government.

Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile disclosure in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d.

Davis, 945 F.3d 9o6, 9l4-l5 (Sth Cir. 2ol9) (affirming conclusion that juror who\nfailed to disclose childhood abuse was not impliedly biased in conviction for sexual assault of a\nchild). Thus, the Court finds no basis to infer that Juror 5o is biased.\n\nThe Defendant’s arguments to the contrary do not disturb the Court’s conclusion that\nJuror 5o was neither impliedly nor inferably biased. First, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o\nwas impliedly biased because of multiple “dishonest answers.” Maxwell Br. at 36; Maxwell\nPost-Hearing Br. at ll.8 But this is not a case involving a juror’s extreme deceit due to a desire\nto be selected. By contrast, in United States v. Daugerdas, on which the Defendant extensively\nrelies, a juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury.” 867 F.

That is what's\n24 in issue, and the question is what the trial record establishes\n25 with respect to that two-month windou.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.eee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l566\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021570.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o39, Pagel4o of 2l7\n29\nM6SOmaxl\nl THE COURT: It's not dated November 2oo4; am I right?\n2 It's on a page that has dates surrounding it of December,\n3 November.\n4 MS.

Again, it's\nl8 the defendant's burden to establish withdrawal from an ongoing\nl9 conspiracy, which they've not atempted to do, nor could they.\n2o We think that the message pads, the flight records, the fact\nal that the testimony of a crime victim Carolyn was that the\n22 conspiracy was ongoing more than meets this burden.\n23 THE COURT: Okay.\n24 MR.

The Electronics Technician told the OIG that he found that roughly half of the\ninstitution's approximately l5o cameras, which were assigned to record to DVR 2, were displaying a live\nvideo feed but were not recording.\nThe Electronics Technician told the OIG that, before Epstein’s death, no one was specifically tasked with\nensuring that video from the cameras was being recorded. The Electronics Technician said he therefore did\nnot perform any daily checks to ensure that video was being recorded. The Warden indicated that SIS staff\nare usually responsible for checking the system for recording functionality and reporting any problems to\nthe Communications Office. Houever, the SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that it was her belief that the\nElectronics Technician should have been checking the system daily to ensure it was recording. The OIG\nfound that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that institutional staff must perform periodic\nchecks to ensure the camera system is fully functional or that security camera systems have the capacity to\nrecord.*° The Facility Manager told the OIG that since Epstein’s death, he nou checks to ensure that all\ncameras and the recording system are working on a daily basis, and he subsequently provides a report\nabout the status of the system to the facility's executive staff, the SIS, and the electronics technicians.\n\nB. Response on August 8 and 9 to Discovery of the Recording Failure\nOn August 8, follouing discovery of the recording failure, Company l service request records reflect that the\nElectronics Technician contacted a Company l <span class=\"highlight\">technical</span> support representative, who ultimately determined\nthat two hard drives within DVR 2 had failed. According to the Electronics Technician and the Company l\nservice request record, the Company l representative informed the Electronics Technician that the two\ndrives needed to be replaced and DVR 2 needed to be rebuilt in order for the cameras to record again. The\nElectronics Technician told the OIG that he informed a Company l Technician that he had to obtain the\ndrives from MCC New York's Computer Services Manager. The Electronics Technician further stated that he\nleft the institution at the end of his shift and did not obtain the hard drives and did not continue to work on\nthe mater. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he had “no idea” why he did not stay at the facility to\nresolve the problem that day, but he noted for the OIG that he had not historically been required to stay\nafter his shift ended to work on such maters, and even if he had begun working on the DVR that day, he\nwould not have completed the work on August 8 due to the time the rebuilding process takes.>\"\nThe OIG found that the Electronics Technician’s immediate supervisor, the Facility Manager, was on leave\nthat week and therefore was not told on August 8 about the DVR recording failure. The Facility Manager\nconfirmed that he did not learn about the camera problem until days after Epstein’s death. The Electronics\nTechnician told the OIG that he did not report the problem to the Lock and Security Supervisor, who was the\nActing Facility Manager in the Facility Manager's absence. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG that after the\nElectronics Technician had examined the system on August 8, the Electronics Technician informed her that\ncameras were not recording and said, “I'm going to stay and do overtime tonight.” Based on his comment,\n5° For example, BOP Program Statement 55oo.l5, Correctional Services Manual, states generally that the Warden must\nestablish a security inspection system that involves all departments but does not specifically address security camera\nsystems. This program statement is a restricted policy that is not released to the public in its entirety.\n\n5’ According to open source information on digital data storage system rebuilds, the rebuilding process can take up to\nseveral days to complete depending on the number of hard drives that were damaged and the storage capacity of each.\n83\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2345o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES010/DOJ-OGR-00027690.tif": "[CBP-2ol3-o229ll [Darren Indyke_|_—7/8/2ol3[closed | |\n\nCBP-2ol4-oo8o85 Darren K Indyke l/6/2ol4|Closed Duplicate Request || am an atorney submiting this request on behalf of my client, Jeffrey E.\nEpstein (a€ceEpsteina€fl Epstein is a natural person.
