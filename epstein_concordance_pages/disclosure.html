He sold the other jet in June 2ol9.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000284.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6 Filed o7/ll/l9 Page ll of l6\n\nOther than his 2oo8 guilty plea predicated on conduct substantially overlapping the same\nconduct charged here, Mr. Epstein has no criminal history. Congress specifically listed these\nfactors as considerations for the Court, and their absence therefore should weigh in favor of Mr.\nEpstein’s pretrial release. Mr. Epstein comes from a stable and humble family background. All\nof his remaining family members, his brother, niece, and nephew, reside in the United States.\nThrough his business and the five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstein\nemploys people, many of whom have been with him for more than a decade, and feels personally\nresponsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein is admitedly wealthy with all of his financial\nresources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (including the U.S. Virgin Islands)\nand will provide the Court with more specific information regarding his assets in a sealed\nsupplemental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> prior to the upcoming bail hearing if the Court grants leave to file such a\nsealed supplement. Mr. Epstein has, to this point, not provided a complete financial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\non advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy of the information provided to\nthe Court. During the years since his release from incarceration in connection with his Florida\nguilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a law-abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal\nmisconduct during that period and has focused his efforts on business and philanthropy. At the\nCourt’s request, Mr. Epstein will provide a sealed list of his philanthropic donations.\n\nCrucially, the government has failed to proffer any evidence that Mr. Epstein has ever\nindicated an intent to flee from this investigation or any other criminal mater, which several\ncourts have observed is a critical factor in evaluating whether pretrial release is appropriate. See\nHanson, 6l3 F. Supp. 2d at 9o (“In this case, . . . there is no strong circumstantial evidence\nindicating that Mrs. Hanson intends to flee the United States”); United States v. Vortis, 785 F.2d\n327 (D.C. Cir.l986) (serious intent to flee is an important factor); United States v. Cole, 7l5 F.\nSupp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.l988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if arrested). In\nfact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long-term, consistent compliance with Court orders and other\nlegal requirements. Asa result of his 2oo8 guilty plea and corresponding sex-offender\ndesignation, Mr. Epstein is required to (l) register for life as a sex offender; (2) regularly verify\nhis address with Virgin Islands, Florida, and New York authorities; (3) annually update his\nregistry photograph; and (4) provide registration authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel\n(both domestic and international) in which he engages. Mr. Epstein has strictly complied with\nthese requirements, without exception, for approximately ten years.\n\nThe Court inquired about the relationship of the New York State registration\nclassification and the requirements of the Bail Reform Act. And while it is true that the New\nYork Appellate Division held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately classified as a level-three sex\noffender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking and based on the allegations contained in a\nFlorida probable cause affidavit describing conduct ending in 2oo5 that were neither admited-to\nnor within the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D. 3d 57o, 57l\n(N.Y. App. Div. 2oll). While Mr. Epstein has made no subsequent atempt to challenge the\ncontinuing nature of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the ensuing decade plus\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo284\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000295.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document6-l Filed o7/ll/l9 Page6ofl5\nCase 9:o8-cv-8o736-KAM Document 36l-62 a on FLSD Docket o2/lo/2ol6 Page 6 of\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

The Court asked a question about that.\n\n6 Your Honor, we just became aware of those payments\n\n7 late last week. We, frankly, don't have additional information\n8 other than that they were paid, that they were paid to two\n\n9 individuals who were associated with the defendant at the time,\nlo and that those two individuals are both listed in the\n\nll non-prosecution agreement.\n\nl2 So there is certainly an inference there that the\n\nl3 defendant was atempting to influence them right around when he\nl4 came back into public consciousness.\n\nl5 Your Honor, the victims in this case seek detention\n\nl6 and fear his release. And most of all, he is an extraordinary\nl7 flight risk. As the government has discussed, he has six\n\nl8 homes. He ouns two private islands. He ouns a residence in\n\nl9 France. And he has told his oun financial institution that he\n2o is worth more than $5oo million.\n2l In the government's filing last Monday, we described\n22 the defendant as being extraordinarily wealthy which was\n23 confirmed by the defense even in his very minimal financial\n24 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n25 Since the government's initial filing, we have\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo522\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000524.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document36_ Filed o7/24/l9 Page l4 of 74 La\n\nl Your Honor, with a case that's no longer covert, we\n\n2 have been able to dramatically expand the scope of our\n\n3 investigation in just the last week. And that additional\n\n4 evidence builds on a case that was already indicted by a grand\n5 jury, that already included evidence of dozens of alleged\n\n6 victims, that already included significant corroborated\n\n7 evidence, evidence that led to the charges for which this\n\n8 66-year-old defendant could serve up to 45 years in prison.\n\n9 The defendant has essentially conceded that the\n\nlo government will be able to prove the elements of the crimes\n\nll currently alleged. They acknouledged in their submission that\nl2 the government likely will be able to shou that the defendant\nl3 engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were under\n\nl4 age.\n\nl5 Nou, in the face of all of this evidence and the\n\nl6 extraordinary incentives for the defendant to flee, what does\nl7 the defendant propose? Nothing that would meaningfully\n\nl8 mitigate the risks of danger and especially flight.\n\nl9 THE COURT: Are you talking about the bail package\n2o nou?\n2l MR.

This is not sworn. It's\nlo not under penalty of perjury. There are no account statements.\nll There are no bank records.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo747\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000748.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66- Filed o7/29/25 Page 3of lo\n(i) the identity of the party seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (ll) whether the\ndefendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (i) why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is being sought in the particular\ncase; (iv) what specific information is being sought for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>;\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi) the\ncurrent status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that\nof their families; (vi) the extent to which the desired material—\neither permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously made\npublic; (vi) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who\nmight be affected by <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are still alive; and (ix) the additional\nneed for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nIn re Craig, l33 F.3d at lo6.\n\nOn July 22, 2o25, the Court directed the Government to file a memorandum of law\n“addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as germane to\nits application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). The Court also directed the\nGovernment to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, counsel for the Government\nreviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government provided notice to the\nvictims of the motion to unseal,” and to submit: (l) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand jury\nmaterials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of the\nEpstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein\nand Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits.

The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. Jn re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, nor can\ngovernment opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n* See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo749\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000750.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 5oflo\nnature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the\nunderlying proceedings.\n\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000751.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 6of lo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo75l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000752.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document66~ Filed o7/29/25 Page 7 of lo\n6. The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation.

Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\ndetective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\nDetective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them.

In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl.

Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3.

Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F.

The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000763.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of 4\nHon.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo763\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000764.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 7o Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\n\nHon.

See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With\nrespect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously\nreceived victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein maters, the Government will over the\ncoming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.\n\nFinally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of\nvictims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of\nthese and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to\nmodify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so\nas promptly as practicable.\n\nAs always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.\n\nRespectfully submited,\n\nPAMELA J.

Epstein, l9-cr-49o (RMB) and U.S. v.\nMaxwell, 2o-cr-33o (PAE)\nDear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,\n\nWe write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from\nthe Department of Justice on July 25, 2o25, advising that the Court is seeking leters on behalf of\nvictims seting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine\nMaxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!\n\nBy the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s actions. To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n\n‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\n? Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\n\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000767.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 2of5\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is\nappropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at lo6. We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential\nleniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000768.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of5\nBSF\n\nA. Why <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” * yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In Jn re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l—2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\nhtps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- ooooo768\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000769.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 72 Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of5\nBSF\naffirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\nTheir consent to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material’).\n\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\n\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6. In Doe J v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently found that the privacy interest of a victim of Epstein\njustified sealing because “[p]rotecting the identity of sexual assault survivors and the details of\ntheir assaults is traditionally considered private and has been widely recognized as a compelling\nreason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F.

United States, o8-8o736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro\nbono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government\npreviously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,\ndespite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that\ndisregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken\nhold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the\ncurrent administration.\nOf significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before\nmoving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is nou the government representing to this Court\nthat it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper\nreview and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nin the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo772\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000773.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 3of4\n\nHonorable Richard M.

Related privacy provisions reinforce\nthis approach. See, e.g., l8 U.S.C. § 35o9(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’\nidentities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.l (privacy redactions).\nMany Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those nou adults, § 377l (a)(8)\nand the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 35o9(d)\nprinciples.\n\nWI. Requested Relief\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 377l (a)(5), (c)(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and, if so, the narrouest scope of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo773\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000774.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo49o-RMB Document 73 Filed o8/o5/25 Page 4of4\nHonorable Richard M.

Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several\nvictims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured\nprofound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the\nyears follouing. To nou compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—\nespecially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the leter and the spirit of\nthe CVRA.\nThe CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point touard narrou tailoring, maximal\nprivacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.\nWe respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.\nRespectfully submited,\nBradley Edwards\nBritany Henderson\nEDWARDS HENDERSON\n425 North Andrews Avenue, Suite 2\nFort Lauderdale, Florida 333ol\nTelephone: (954) 524-282o\nEmail: brad@cvlf.com\n\nbritany@cvlf.com\nPaul G.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo848\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000849.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooooo886\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00000887.jpg": "Case 2l-77o, Document 3-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million.

A//\ncounsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance.\nThe government’s challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense.\nDefending quarter-century-old allegations has required investigation across this country and\naround the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same efforts and diligence.\nIt is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the\nindictment and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month. The estimates are mere\nguesses which do not factor in time-consuming COVID jury selection in a high-publicity case\nnecessitating sensitive and personal disclosures by prospective jurors or the presentation of\ndefense evidence.

The government’s April l2\" <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference. Counsel\nhave other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follou the\nsummer trial of this case. These commitments make us unavailable from September through\nDecember, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,\nbefore mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled.

Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A {¥ 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001648.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 29-l Filed o7/27/2o Page 2 of l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~e ee ee eee LLL LL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° PROVE CPT vn ONDER\n- 7, = :\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n~e ee ee eee LLL LL\nALISON J.

Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order § 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool665\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001669.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33 Filed o7/28/2o Page 6 of 7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool669\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001671.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 33-l Filed o7/28/2o Page l of l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter to reply to\nthe government’s response leter and submission regarding the proposed protective order in the\nabove-captioned case, dated July 28, 2o2o (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.\n33).\n\nThe parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating to the\nproposed protective order. The parties agree that there are two areas of dispute as to which we\nrequire guidance from the Court. As noted in our opening leter and belou, we respectfully\nsubmit that the arguments made by the government are unavailing, and that the defense’s\nproposed protective order, atached as Exhibit A to our initial submission (Dkt. 29), should be\nentered by the Court.\n\nl. Referencing Individuals Who Have Publicly Identified Themselves\n\nThe starting point for evaluating the scope of a proposed protective order is whether there\nare valid privacy interests at issue. It is the government’s burden to establish “good cause” that\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will cause “a clearly defined and serious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d\nl94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7) (citation omited). The Court should also ensure that the proposed\nrestriction is “no broader than is necessary” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact\nthat the restriction may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full\ndefense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2). Throughout\nits leter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool685\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001687.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 35 Filed o7/29/2o Page 3 of 5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Epstein, l9-CR-oo49o-\nRMB (Dkt. 38 § 4).!\n\nThe government’s position would unfairly limit the defense, and goes further than is\nrequired to protect valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not meet the government’s\nburden under the law. As this Court recently recognized in Hernandez v. Kirby Forensic\nPsychiatric Hosp., No. l4-CV-59lo (AJN), 2ol9 WL 464oo54 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2ol9), an\nindividual’s privacy interest in sensitive information is relinquished by knouing and intentional\npublic <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that hospital staff violated his privacy rights\nby disclosing his HIV status to patients and other staff. Nevertheless, because the plaintiff had,\nhimself, disclosed his HIV status to the entire hospital ward, he “forfeited any reasonable\nexpectation that this information would remain confidential[.]” /d. at *5; see also In re Avaya,\nInc., No. l7-loo89 (SMB), 2ol9 WL l75o9o8, at *7 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 2ol9) (“[A]\nperson waives his right to privacy when he puts the private information at issue in a lawsuit.”);\nSmith v. NBC Universal, 524 F. Supp. 2d 3l5, 328-29 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (holding that facts\ndisclosed in video broadcast on national television with plaintiff's express permission “cannot be\nconsidered private”); id. at n. 84 (“There is no liability when the defendant merely gives further\npublicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement\n(Second) of Torts § 652D cmt. b (l977)). The cases that the government cites in its leter are\ninapposite, as none addressed the privacy rights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily\ndisclosed their identities to the public. (Gov. Resp. at 2.).”\n\nMoreover, the language proposed by the defense will permit it to conduct a full and\nmeaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective\nassistance of counsel. Our client, of course, is presumed innocent, and intends to fight the\ncharges against her. The defense believes that there are individuals who have exculpatory\nevidence concerning Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing on the credibility of the alleged\nvictims and witnesses. Although the government’s proposed protective order would allou for\nsome investigation in this regard, permiting defense counsel and defense investigators to\n' The government indicates that there may be alleged victims and witnesses who have chosen to remain anonymous.\n(Gov't Resp. at 4). As reflected in our proposed order, the defense has agreed not to mention publicly the identities\nof any such individuals. Instead, to satisfy its burden, the government posits a series of “hypothetical examples”\nrelating to individuals and the type of interactions they may have had with various public fora. (d.). Hypothetical\nexamples are not a shouing of “good cause.” Moreover, the defense cannot address these scenarios without\nknouing if they relate to actual persons, and if so, the nature of such interactions.\n\n° See United States v. Corley, No. l3-CR-48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *3-*4 (S.D.N.Y.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 37 Filed o7/3o/2o Page 2 of 3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter motion\nseeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell’s ability\nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial production” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its production of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first production until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] protective order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 38 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Feb.\n5, 2ool) (ordering <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of government witness list where defendant “ha[d] met his burden\nto shou a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>”).” This\nprinciple has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a\ndefense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and\nwarrant the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime\nvictim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is\nsignificantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim’); see also\nid. (“Absent knouing the identity of Victim l, the defendant is precluded from investigating the\nfacts surrounding the crime charged.”).\n\nThe defense’s narrouly-tailored request, which only seeks the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identity\nof Victims l-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any\nalleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 4 5), the\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims l-3. Nor is there any basis for\nthe government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to\ntestify.’ To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in\ncriminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,\nMs. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to\ngive interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims l-3\nare no longer minors, but are nou adults in their late 3os or early 4os, which provides additional\nassurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is therefore warranted here.\n* In determining whether to order pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have\nconsidered the follouing factors: (l) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2)\nHave the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case\nlargely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a\nrealistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the\nprosecution’s witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege\noffenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and\ndifficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb,\n2ool WL 96l77, at *7-8 (citation omited). The Second Circuit, houever, has not adopted these factors, nor do they\nconstitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities\nof alleged victims.\n\n* Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.\n(See 7/l4/2o2o Tr. at 37:l5-2l).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001711.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 39 Filed o8/lo/2o Page l of 2\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\na\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nOn behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this leter motion\nseeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell’s ability\nto receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an\norder directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged\nvictims referenced in the indictment (“Victims l-3”), subject to the restrictions of the protective\norder entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully\ninvestigate the alleged conduct, which is nou over 25 years old. Second, we request that the\nCourt enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to release Ms. Maxwell into the\ngeneral population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials\nwhile she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense.\n\nl. _ <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Victim Identities\n\nThe Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims l-3 to\ndefense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot\nprepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is\nauthorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrouly-tailored and reasonable under the\ncircumstances of this case.\n\nHere, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government’s case is based on the\naccounts of Victims l-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is\ntherefore critical for the defense to knou the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 88 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 2 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust lo, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nthat we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is\nespecially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly\n25 years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United\nKingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in\nmisconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to\nspeculate which of these individuals are Victims l-3 referenced in the indictment.\n\nIt is nou almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, and the government is just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not\nconfirmed to the defense the identities of Victims l-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2,\n2o2o. On July l4, 2o2o, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that\nit had “begun preparing an initial production” and would be “prepared to produce a first batch of\ndiscovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court.”' The Court entered the\nprotective order on July 3o, 2o2o. (Dkt. 36). The follouing day, July 3l, 2o2o, defense counsel\ncontacted the government and requested <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of Victims l-3. The\ngovernment refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims\nthrough its production of Rule l6 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material\ncloser to trial. That same day, per the government’s request, the defense provided a hard drive to\nload the Rule l6 discovery. Houever, the government did not make its first production until\nafter 2:oo p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o.\n\nThe government’s initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,\ntotaling nearly l3,ooo pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content.\nUpon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual.\nHouever, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim l, 2, or 3.\nThe defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three\nalleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to\ncontain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has\nindicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is\nany guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged\nVictims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks\nuntil August 2l, 2o2o (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or\npotentially months until November 9, 2o2o (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before\nlearning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial depends on\nthe defense’s ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will\nbe significantly impaired until we knou for certain the names of Victims l-3.\n\n\"July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2:l4-l7; see also id. at l2:25-l3:3 (“Follouing the entry of [the] protective order . . . the\ngovernment is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.”).\nDOJ-OGR-ooool7l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001715.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 88 Filed o8/lo/2o Page 3 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Ltr.”), requesting that the Court order the\nGovernment to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses ll months prior to trial, and\nrequesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of\nthe Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied.\n\nA. The Defendant’s Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses\n\nFor the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the\nCourt for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2o2o (Dkt. 28)\n(denying the defendant’s request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and\natorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements “concerning this case”); Order\ndated July 3o, 2o2o (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant’s application for a protective order that would\nallou the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant’s most recent\napplication, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the\nform of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’’),\nfully ll months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of\ndiscovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nhad no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding for witness lists and 35oo material.\n\nIn the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production,\narguing that “almost six weeks since” the arrest of the defendant, the Government is “just nou\nbeginning to produce Rule l6 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would\nbegin as soon as the Court entered a protective order.” Def.

The\nGovernment then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than l2,ooo\npages the follouing Wednesday, August 5, 2o2o. Additionally, the Government continues to\nproduce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense\ncounsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than l5o,ooo pages, principally consisting of\nfinancial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of\nelectronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial\ndiscovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has\nnou produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 2l, 2o2o, and\napproximately ll months prior to trial.\n\nIn sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,\nproviding more than l65,ooo pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks follouing the\nentry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the\ngeneral topics and sources of the materials.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Defense Leter claims that over the course of just five days,\ndefense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level\ncontent,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based\non the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the\ndefendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.\n\nTellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in\nthe litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately ll months before\ntrial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975), although the opinion acknouledged\nthe ability of district courts to compel <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identity of government witnesses, the\nSecond Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case\nbecause the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 3ol-o2. In United States v.\nRueb, oo Cr. o9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.

The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the\ndefendant’s counsel who represent her in both this criminal mater as well as in certain civil\nmaters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials\nin discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing\nthat they purportedly had received “critical new information” from the criminal case that it could\nnot disclose “because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action,” and further noting\npublicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in\nthe civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell,\nNo. l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. lloo). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to\nscrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal\nstandards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool72l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001722.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 4l Filed o8/l3/2o Page 4 of5\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l3, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nany such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the\nGovernment a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared\nto engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof 35oo material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce\nreasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2o2l to permit the defense to investigate witnesses.\nBut particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government’s strong desire to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly\nthree months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial\nmotions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the\nidentity of its witnesses.\n\nB. The Defendant’s Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement\n\nThe defendant’s requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the\nMetropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request\nthat the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’) should also\nbe denied.’\n\nAs an initial mater, the defendant’s argument that she is being treated “worse” than other\ninmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is\nentirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has\nnever before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison.\nAdditionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her\nperson or space as appropriate.” It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific “privileges given to\nother pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied.\n\nMore generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized\nassessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons\nincluding safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the\ndetermination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style\naccommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will\n4 Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made litle\nor no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government\nlearned of the defendant’s specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time\nfrom the Defense Leter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues\nas appropriate. Moreover, as noted belou, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the BOP’s\nplan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and\nultimately modify) that plan.\n> Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe” the defendant “including her phone\nconversations with defense counsel.” This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is\nable to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to\nMDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete\ncalls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool722\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001725.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 2 of 5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nindictment alleges 25-year-old conduct that supposedly occurred on unspecified dates in multiple\nlocations on different continents, and involves numerous alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein.\nMoreover, the government’s position is based on the claimed privacy rights of the alleged\nvictims, nou all adults, who may well have sued Mr. Epstein and/or Ms. Maxwell in public civil\nactions or otherwise identified themselves by name in public fora. As discussed belou and in\nour opening leter, under the relevant legal standards, the relief sought can and should be ordered\nhere.\n\nWith regard to Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, the government asserts, in\nessence, that such maters should be left not to this Court, but to the discretion of the BOP. We\ndo not agree. Under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would have been forced to choose\nbetween reviewing the voluminous discovery in this case, on the one hand, or taking a shouer,\neating a meal or exercising, on the other. That would not be consistent with her right to\nmeaningfully review materials and prepare for trial. Indeed, the very filing of the present motion\napparently prompted the BOP to make certain of the changes the defense had requested. We\nrespectfully ask the Court to confirm these changes in an order, along with the other relief\nrequested.\n\nl. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Alleged Victim Identities\n\nThe government concedes that this Court has the authority to order it to disclose to\ndefense counsel the identities of the three individuals referenced in the indictment. (Gov’t Resp.\nat 2). As we understand it, these three individuals are the core of the government’s case against\nMs. Maxwell. Yet, according to the government, the defense must make assumptions about their\nidentities until they are finally revealed a few weeks prior to trial. If that occurs, it is very\npossible that the defense will waste the next several months investigating someone whose name\nappears in the discovery, but who is not one of the three alleged victims, and whom the\ngovernment does not even intend to call as a witness at trial.\n\nIndeed, the defense has again conducted a high-level review of the second discovery\nproduction and, at first glance, there does not appear to be any information that specifically\nidentifies these three witnesses. According to the government, the two productions they have\nmade “constitute the vast majority of initial discovery.” (Ud. at 2). But the defense still does not\nknou for certain who these individuals are and will likely not knou until the eve of trial, if the\ngovernment has their way. That is fundamentally inconsistent with the notion of a fair trial,\nespecially when it is inherently difficult to investigate instances of abuse that allegedly occurred\n25 years ago (even when the identity of the alleged victim is knoun), and when the alleged\nvictims do not have a strong countervailing privacy interest to protect, as discussed belou.!\n\n' The government’s atempt at a compromise solution—providing the birth months and years of the alleged\nvictims—is insufficient. (Gov’t Resp. at 2 n.2). Such partial information only helps confirm the identity of\nDOJ-OGR-ooool725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001726.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust l7, 2o2o\nPage 3\n\nThe government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (l) the need “to protect the\nprivacy of the alleged victims,” and (i) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a\nrequest. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.\n\nAs to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this\ncase, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial\nleter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.\nMaxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,\nto the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three\nindividuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess\nwho they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these\nindividuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred\nroughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are nou adults in their early 4os. Nor has\nthe government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or\nthat they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any\nprivacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to\nprepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. o9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL\n427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged\nrape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the\nidentity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the\nlikelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to\nprepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged\nvictim] undisclosed.”’).\n\nThe government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is\nincorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the\npouer to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial leter, the Second Circuit formally\nrecognized that district courts have the authority to order the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of\ngovernment witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975). Although\nCannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nwitness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknouledges that this Court has\nthe authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).\n\nThe defense also cited in its initial leter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous\nprecedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the\ngovernment to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after\nindictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,\nthe defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim\nwho was allegedly raped by the defendant a litle over two years before the indictment was filed,\nsomeone if you already knou who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is\nunwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool726\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 42 Filed o8/l7/2o Page 4of5\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nAugust l7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\nin stark contrast to the 25-year-old conduct alleged in this case. Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at\n*|-2. The district court recognized “the sensitive nature of the charges and the difficulties facing\nrape victims,” but found that “the defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against this\ncharge [would be] significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim.” Jd. at *2. The district court found that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> was appropriate because, as in this\ncase (l) the defendant was seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identity of an alleged victim who was the\nbasis for a specific crime charged in the indictment, and not just a government witness; (i) the\nindictment did not state “the exact dates” of the alleged abuse or the prior encounters between\nthe defendant and the alleged victim; and (i) the government did not articulate any basis to\nconclude that the alleged victim would be subject to intimidation or would refuse to appear at\ntrial as a result of the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. /d. For the same reasons articulated in Warme, this Court\nshould order the government to disclose immediately the identities of three alleged victims\nreferenced in the indictment, subject to the terms of the protective order.”\n\n2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery\n\nThe government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement should be left to\nthe discretion of the BOP. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). But the BOP cannot be the sole arbiter on these\nissues if the conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s confinement impact her right to a fair trial and to\nmeaningfully prepare her defense. Indeed, under the BOP’s original plan, Ms. Maxwell would\nhave been forced to choose between taking a shouer and reviewing the voluminous discovery in\nthis case. It is only because the defense filed its motion that the BOP modified its original plan\nand gave Ms. Maxwell increased access to the discovery two days later. We nou understand,\nand the government has confirmed, that Ms. Maxwell can review discovery from 7:oo a.m. to\n8:oo p.m. every day of the week. (/d. at 5). We respectfully ask the Court to confirm these\nchanges in an order to the BOP.\n\nHouever, the defense continues to believe that Ms. Maxwell is being subjected to\nuniquely onerous conditions of confinement because of the death of Mr. Epstein in BOP custody.\nFor example, Ms. Maxwell continues to be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and is\n° The government atempts to distinguish Warme by asserting that, unlike Warme, the indictment in this case\n“describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the defendant’s conversations with victims,\ninteractions with victims, and specific relevant locations.” (Gov’t Resp. at 3). That is incorrect. In fact, the\nindictment in Warme was far more specific as to the dates of the relevant events, alleging that the rape took place\n“sometime in and around October of 2oo6.” Warme, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2. By contrast, the indictment in this\ncase alleges vague instances of “grooming” that supposedly took place over the course of a year (in the case of\nVictim 2), two years (in the case of Victim 3), or even four years (in the case of Victim l). Those are hardly “exact\ndates.” The criminal complaint in Warme also alleged specific interactions between the defendant and the alleged\nvictim; namely, that they “had met and exchanged phone numbers perhaps as long as lo months prior to the alleged\nrape.” Jd. Nevertheless, the district court held that the defendant’s right to prepare his defense required <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof the identity of the alleged victim and outweighed any privacy interest that the victim might have.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool734\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 47 Filed o8/2l/2o Page 2 of 4\nHonorable Alison J.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nDOJ-OGR- ooool738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001743.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 49 Filed o8/25/2o Page_lof4 a\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #: “x\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED:_8/25/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant.

Dkt.\nNo. 38 at l. Her request is premature. Production of discovery, which may itself identify\nalleged victims and relevant witnesses to the defense, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have\nnot yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures,\nincluding witness lists and § 35oo material.

The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.

Similar cases in this district demonstrate the “non-standard” nature of the\ngovernment’s conduct regarding these subpoenas.

In particular, at the initial conference in this mater on July l4, 2o2o, the Court\nasked the Government about its plan to ensure timely review the files of other agencies for potential\ndisclosures in this case and highlighted the Court’s expectation that the Government would be\nthoughtful and probing in its assessment of such a review. Consistent with the Government’s\ncommitment to take a thorough and transparent approach to its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, this leter\noutlines the relevant investigative files of which the Government is currently aware and describes\nthe Government’s approach as to each.\n\nl. Background Regarding the Government’s Rule l6 Discovery Productions\n\nThe charges in this case arise out of an investigation conducted by the United States\nAtorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York Police Department (the “NYPD”’)\n(collectively, the “Prosecution Team’). That investigation was opened in 2ol8 and remains\nongoing. The Government has copies of the full investigative files for this case from the USAO-\nSDNY, the FBI New York Office, and the NYPD (the “Prosecution Team Files”). The bulk of the\nproductions to date have come from the Prosecution Team Files. The Government is continuing\nto review the Prosecution Team Files for any additional materials that warrant <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nSpecifically, to date, the Government has produced approximately 328,863 pages of\ndiscovery to the defense in this case. Those materials include, among other things, photographs,\ndocuments seized during searches, search warrants, search warrant applications, financial records,\ntravel records, property records, phone records, law enforcement reports, and other subpoena\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001788.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 2 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nreturns. The Government is continuing the process of reviewing and preparing productions of\nelectronic discovery materials, which include extractions of data from numerous electronic\ndevices. The Government expects that it will meet the November 9, 2o2o deadline for the\ncompletion of electronic discovery productions. Additionally, the Government recognizes that its\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations are ongoing, and the Government will continue to review the Prosecution\nTeam Files for any additional discoverable or exculpatory materials. In particular, the Government\nis aware of its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and its progeny, and will\npromptly produce any exculpatory material of which it becomes aware.\n\nThe Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions do not include witness statements or\nmaterial under Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) and its progeny, consistent with the\ncommon practice and law within this Circuit. As indicated in a prior leter, the Government intends\nto produce all such materials to the defense well in advance of trial.' Specifically, although the\nparties have not yet conferred regarding a schedule for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness statements, the\nGovernment is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for witnesses it\nexpects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the Government is\nprepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial as early as\neight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals’ privacy to be\nnegotiated by the parties.\n\nIl. Applicable Law Governing <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Other Investigative Files\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations set forth in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6, Brady, and\nGiglio apply to materials in the Government’s “possession.” As a general mater, though “[a]n\nindividual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knouledge of all information gathered in connection\nwith his office’s investigation of the case[,] . . . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a\ndifferent office of the government does not in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge\nto the prosecutor... .” United States v. Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations\nomited); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 948-49 (2d Cir. l993) (declining to “infer\nthe prosecutors’ knouledge simply because some other government agents knew about” additional\nevidence where federal prosecutors were unaware of documents in possession of FBI agents who\nwere “uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants”); United States v. Quinn, 445 F.2d\n94o, 944 (2d Cir. l97l) (declining to impute knouledge of prosecutor in Florida to prosecutor in\nNew York and noting that the “Department of Justice alone has thousands of employees”). The\nimposition of such “an unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with\nthe prosecutor’s office on the case in question would inappropriately require [courts] to adopt ‘a\nmonolithic view of government’ that would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state\nof paralysis.” Avellino, l36 F.3d at 255 (quoting United States v. Gambino, 835 F. Supp. 74, 95\n(E.D.N.Y. l993)). Thus, discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations only extend to “information knoun\n' The Government recognizes that its Brady obligations include the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness\nstatements containing exculpatory information. To date, the Government is not aware of any\nexculpatory material contained in any witness statements, but it will continued to review its files,\nincluding witness statements, for such material. If the Government becomes aware of any Brady\nmaterial from any source, it will promptly disclose such material to the defense.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 3 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J.

See\nUnited States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO), 2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y.

See, e.g., United States v.\nStein, 424 F.

Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 4\n\nlil. The Government’s Plan to Review Certain Files from the Florida Investigation\nA. Relevant Background Regarding the Florida Investigation (2oo5-2olo)\nBetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo, and as detailed further belou, members of the\nPalm Beach Police Department, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office, the U.S Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”), and the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident\nAgency (the “FBI Florida Office”) conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein for his sexual abuse of minors in Florida (the “Florida Investigative Team” and the\n“Florida Investigation,” respectively). The Prosecution Team in this case had no involvement in\nthe Florida Investigation, which predated the instant investigation by approximately eight years.”\nSimilarly, the Florida Prosecution Team and the agencies involved in the Florida Investigation\nhave had no involvement in the investigative, charging, or prosecutorial strategy decisions of the\nProsecution Team in this case. Accordingly, under the governing law of this Circuit as discussed\nabove, there is no basis for deeming the Florida Prosecution Team a part of the current Prosecution\nTeam, and the Government does not believe it has any legal obligation to obtain or review the\ninvestigative files of those agencies. As discussed belou, houever, the Government is\nnevertheless prepared to go significantly above and beyond its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations by requesting\nfiles from the Florida Investigation that have at least some potential to contain materials that could\nbe relevant to the instant case, and by reviewing and producing those materials as appropriate in\nthis case.?\n? As detailed herein, during the course of its investigation, the Prosecution Team has gathered\nsome documents related to the Florida Investigation, principally consisting of the FBI Florida\nOffice’s case file for the Florida Investigation. Those materials are being treated as a part of the\nProsecution Team’s files and will be produced, to the extent covered by Rule l6 or any other\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligation, to the defendant in this case.\n>In addition to the Florida Investigation, the Government is aware, through public reporting\namong other means, of a number of other investigations into maters relating to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFor example, it has been publicly reported that local agencies in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Paris, and\nLondon have conducted and may still be conducting investigations into Epstein, which may\ninclude investigation into his sexual abuse of minors. There has also been public reporting\nregarding investigations into Epstein’s finances, including an investigation by the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and into the conditions of Epstein’s confinement while serving\nhis sentence follouing the Florida Investigation. Additionally, the USAO-SDNY conducted an\ninvestigation into Epstein’s suicide and is currently prosecuting two corrections officers as a result\nof that investigation. See United States v. Noel and Thomas, l9 Cr. 83o (AT). Separately, the FBI\nFlorida Office investigated and ultimately prosecuted an employee of Epstein’s named Alfredo\nRodriguez for obstruction of justice, see United States v. Alfredo Rodriguez, lo Cr. 8ool5 (KAM),\nand the Prosecution Team has received some files from that case. The Government does not intend\nto further seek out or review the investigative files of any such cases, which are completely\nunrelated to the subject mater of the instant prosecution and/or have been conducted by entities\nthat are not part of this Prosecution Team and, in some instances, the Department of Justice.\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001791.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 5of8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 5\nB. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the\nFlorida Investigation\n\nAs an initial mater, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has\nobtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The\nGovernment has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and\nintends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nin this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-3o2 of any relevant witness interview;\nany relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that\ninvestigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence\nconducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains\nsubstantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,\nif applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this\ncase,\n\nIn total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the\nFlorida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as\nfollous:\n\nFirst, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey\nEpstein in or about 2oo5. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,\nconducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed\na search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2oo6, the PBPD referred its\ninvestigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD\nprovided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution\nTeam already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and\nwill continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case.\nAdditionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed\nthe Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already\nprovided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, houever, the Government\nasked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in\nPBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist\nprovided the Government with 6o pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for\nany material that is non-duplicative and warrants <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case. The Prosecution Team\nhas identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as\npart of its next discovery production to the defense.\n\nSecond, the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,\namong other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo5 and 2olo (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that\ninvestigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution\nand soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September l4, 2o2o, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.\n* As detailed belou, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Atorney’s Office.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001792.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 6 of 8\n\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober 7, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nAlthough the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless\ncommunicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its\nentire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September l4, 2o2o, the PBSA\nprovided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida\nInvestigation, which consists of 4,42l pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The\nGovernment is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material\npreviously obtained and that warrants <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case.\n\nThird, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida\nOffice are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a\ncomplete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this\ncase. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files\nfrom the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been\ntransferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those\nfiles have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has\npreviously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,\nand as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as\npart of prior discovery productions in this case.\n\nFourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein\nbetween approximately 2oo6 and 2olo. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received\nany documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.\nIndeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its oun\nEpstein investigation in 2ol8, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the\nUSAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this\ncase. Houever, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the\nUSAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of\nits entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that\nwarrants <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is\ncontained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government\nhired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review\nplatform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor\ntoday and intends to review that file for materials that warrant <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case.\n\nFifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have\nbeen gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as\npart of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In\nparticular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to\nthe extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL\natorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.\nAtorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Atorney-l’).\n> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknouledged by the Department of Justice.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool792\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001793.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 7 of 8\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 7, 2o2o\nPage 7\n\nAlthough the Government does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails\nsent or received by atorneys at the USAO-SDFL as part of their separate, prior investigation, the\nGovernment nonetheless intends to gather and review the emails sent to or from Atorney-l to the\nextent those emails were preserved and gathered by OPR. As noted, Atorney-l was the primary\nline assistant on that investigation, and Atorney-l’s emails are thus the most likely to contain\ncommunications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained\nAtorney-l’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails\ninto an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms\nrelevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.\nBased on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a\nsubstantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this\nprosecution. But to the extent searches of Atorney-l’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or\n35oo material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified\nmaterial consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government\ndoes not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice\natorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s\noffice from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered\nby OPR as part of its investigation.\n\nSixth, beginning in or about 2ol9, atorneys with the United States Atorney’s Office for\nthe Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the\nrepresentation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of\nthe Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida\nInvestigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government\nintends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications\nwith witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or\n(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government\nwill request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials\nthat warrant <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or\nreview any materials from the USAO-SDGA.\n\n%* %* XK\n\nAs noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the\ninvestigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has\nparticipated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.\nNor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,\nmaking charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the\nGovernment maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,\ngiven the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct\ninvestigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the\nextensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will\ncontinue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in this case, including\nin connection with its production of Giglio and 35oo material.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool793\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 63 Filed lo/o7/2o Page 8 of 8\nHonorable Alison J.

(Dkt. 6o).\nThe government’s request should be denied for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the government’s leter that the Materials pertain to individuals who\nclaim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.\nMaxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials\nidentifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be\ndisclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v.

Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 3\nB. Discussion\nl. The Materials Are Subject to <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Under Brady Because They Refute the\nGovernment’s Theory of the Charged Crimes\n\nThe government states that, as part of its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual abuse\nof minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims of Epstein’s sexual abuse and obtained\nsensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted\nafter l997 — 7.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the\nsuperseding indictment (the “Indictment”). (Dkt. 6o at 2). Stated differently, the government has\ninterviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms.\nMaxwell participated in Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse, or “groomed” them for Epstein, or had\nanything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced.\nAlthough the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the\ntime period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still\nfundamentally inconsistent with the government’s theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein’s\n“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.\n\nFurthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government’s theory of the perjury\ncounts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment\nbecause they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after l997, and therefore “post-date\nthe time period charged in the Indictment.” (Dkt. 6o at 2). That is incorrect. The government\nforgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred after l997 when it\nincluded the perjury counts in the Indictment.\n\nThe perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2ol5 by\none of Epstein’s alleged victims (“Accuser-l”). In December 2ol4, Accuser-l filed a motion to\njoin a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2oo7.\nAccuser-l’s motion “described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who Epstein used to\nprocure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his\nsexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Accuser-l] v. Maxwell, l5-CV-o7433 (RWS)\n(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. l at 927). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l’s allegations, claiming that\nthey were untrue. Accuser-l, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\nCounts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case.\nThe scope of these depositions was not limited to the l994-l997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms.\nMaxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knouledge of Epstein’s sexual\nactivities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein’s sexual abuse after l997 is\ntherefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool797\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001798.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 4 of 6\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober l4, 2o2o\nPage 4\n\nFor example, Count Five alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the follouing exchange:\n\nQ: Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual\n\nmassages? If you knou.\n\nA: [don’t knou what you’re talking about.\n\nSimilarly, Count Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the follouing exchange:\n\nQ: Other than yourself... with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities?\n\nA: Lwasn’t aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when I was\n\nwith him other than myself.\n\nQ: I want to make sure that I’m clear. Is it your testimony that in the l99os and\n\n2ooos, you were not aware that Ms. Epstein was having sexual activities with\nanyone other than yourself... ?\n\nA: That is my testimony, that is correct.\n\nThe government has spoken to numerous individuals who claim to have been assaulted by Epstein\nafter l997, but do not implicate Ms. Maxwell in the assault or claim that she knew about it in any\nway. That bolsters Ms. Maxwell’s defense that she was not aware of either Epstein’s scheme to\nrecruit and sexually abuse underage girls, or that Epstein was engaging in sexual activities with\nothers, and therefore did not perjure herself in response to those questions.\n\nAccordingly, the Materials and the prior statements of the witnesses to whom they pertain\nare exculpatory evidence inconsistent with the government’s theory of the charges in the\nIndictment and must be disclosed pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations.\n\n2. The Government Has Not Shoun Good Cause that <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of the Materials Will\nInterfere with an Ongoing Investigation\n\nEven if the Court does not find this evidence to be exculpatory, the Materials are “material\nto preparing the defense” and therefore should be disclosed under Rule l6(a)(l)(E). The\ngovernment agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good cause to\ndelay the production of the Materials until eight weeks before trial, pursuant to Rule l6(d). (Dkt.\n6o at 2-3). The government’s justification for the delay, houever, is entirely inadequate to\nestablish good cause.\n\nThe government asserts that disclosing the Materials will prematurely reveal to the defense\nthe identities of certain victims of Epstein who are not referenced in the Indictment, as well as\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool798\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001799.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 64 Filed lo/l4/2o Page 5 of 6\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nOctober l4, 2o2o\n\nPage 5\nsensitive information about them. (/d.). The government further asserts that such <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will\n“Seopardize the government’s ongoing investigation” because it will reveal to the defendant the\nscope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward\nto provide evidence. (/d. at l,3). Essentially, the government is arguing that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nMaterials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell knou, at this stage of the\nproceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might\nnot come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell.\n\nThese are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing\ninvestigation and establish good cause for delaying <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Courts typically allou delayed\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> on these grounds when immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may alert other potential targets of the\ninvestigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively\ncooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases\ncited in the government’s oun leter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 53l-32\n(<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain discovery materials might “alert the targets of the investigation and could\nlead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations”); United States v. Mennino, 48o F.\nSupp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential\ndefendants could be disrupted by <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts\noften grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient shouing\nthat <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v.\nUrena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (collecting cases).\n\nThe government has done neither here. The government has not made any shouing that\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize\nthe safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-\nserving concern that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional\nwitnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of “clearly defined,\nspecific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under Rule l6(d)(l).\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government’s requested relief under\nRule l6(d)(l) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the\nprior statements of these witnesses to the defense.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/s/ Christian Everdell\nChristian R.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\n\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in further support of its request to delay\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding\nvictims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are\nnot exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government\nis not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully\nintends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it\nhas interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that\ninvestigation remains ongoing, houever, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges\ncontained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the\nscope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government\nrespectfully requests that it be permited to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.\n\nFirst, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials\nand conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue\nhere include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused\nduring time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness\nstatements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the\nGovernment will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus\ndo not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the\ndefendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed belou,\nwhether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that\npostdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.\n\nSecond, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not\nexculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory\nmaterial beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under\nthe defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after l997 without the\ndefendant’s involvement, that somehou exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her\nwith participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between l994 and l997. (Def. Ltr. 3-4). The\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001803.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\n\nThird, the defense’s claim that the Materials are “material to preparing [her] defense” under\nRule l6, and thus subject to immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, is premised on a reimagining of the charges\nagainst the defendant. (Def. Ltr. l, 4). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule\nl6 only insofar as “it could be used to counter the government’s case or bolster a defense.” United\nStates v. Stevens, 985 F.2d ll75, ll8o (2d Cir. l993). Thus, materials that are wholly irrelevant\nto the Government’s case or the charges in the Indictment do not fall under Rule l6. That is the\ncase here. Contrary to the defense’s claim, the Government has not charged Maxwell with being\nJeffrey Epstein’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def. Ltr. 3). Instead, the\ndefendant is charged with helping Epstein identify, groom, and sexually abuse multiple minor\nvictims between l994 and l997. The Indictment does not allege that the defendant engaged in\nsuch conduct after l997. As such, the Materials are simply not relevant to the charges in the\nIndictment, much less exculpatory to the defendant.\n\nMaxwell’s argument is equally flawed with respect to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).\nThe Indictment alleges that the Government’s evidence on Counts One through Four based on her\nconduct from l994 to l997 is also evidence of the falsity of the answers provided in the deposition.\nSpecifically, the portions of her deposition that the Government alleges in the Indictment are false\nare all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period l994 through l997. Indeed, paragraph eight of the\nIndictment notes that the defendant’s statements during her deposition contradicted “some of the\nspecific events and acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through seven of the Indictment,\nwhich focus exclusively on the period from l994 through l997. (Indictment, Docket No. l7, at\nlo). Consistent with that position, Counts Five and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs\none through eight of the Indictment. (See id. at l5-l6). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant\ndid or did not participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at different times or on different\noccasions not charged in the Indictment would not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate\nthe defendant on those counts.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more importantly, the Government is not suggesting that these\nMaterials should be kept from the defense indefinitely. Rather, the Government requests\nauthorization to provide these Materials eight weeks prior to trial, along with its production of\nstatements of other non-testifying witnesses. Even assuming arguendo that the Materials\nconstitute Brady or Rule l6 evidence—which they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—\nthe defendant cites no case law for the proposition that she is entitled to their production nou,\nrather than eight weeks in advance of trial. The Second Circuit has held that “as a general rule,\nBrady and its progeny do not require immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all exculpatory and impeachment\nmaterial upon request by a defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l46 (2d Cir. 2ool).\nInstead, “the Government ‘suppresses’ evidence within the meaning of Brady only if it fails to\ndisclose Brady and Giglio material in time for its effective use at trial or at a plea proceeding.” Jd.\nWhat constitutes sufficient time for “effective use at trial” depends on the “materiality of that\nevidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.\n\nHere, the defendant has made no shouing as to why eight weeks in advance of trial would\nnot be enough time to make “effective use” of the Materials at trial or hou she would otherwise\nbe prejudiced by the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d at l46. Indeed,\ngiven that the Materials constitute approximately 4o pages of records and approximately 4o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001804.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 65 Filed lo/2o/2o Page 4 of 4\nPage 4\nphotographs of victims who were abused during periods of time that post-date the Indictment and\nwho the Government does not anticipate calling to testify at trial—and as such, do not constitute\nBrady material, Rule l6 evidence, or impeachment material for any trial witnesses—the defendant\nis not entitled to their immediate production. This is particularly so when weighed against the\nrisks of early production to the Government’s ongoing investigation.\n\nBy contrast, the Government has met its burden under Rule l6(d)(l) by explaining why\nthe requested delay is necessary and hou the Government would be prejudiced by the immediate\nproduction of the Materials. In particular, the proposed delay will allou the Government to\ncontinue its investigation into conduct outside the period charged in the Indictment without\nrevealing to the defendant the identities of the witnesses in that investigation. The premature\nrevelation of this information would give the defendant the opportunity to interfere with the\nGovernment’s investigation before it is complete. Such information could allou her to contact\nand intimidate witnesses, destroy evidence relevant to the investigation, or alert other targets of\nthe investigation. Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey\nEpstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when\nit has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming\nforward to assist in the Government’s investigation. Allouing the delayed production of these\nmaterials would permit the Government to complete its investigation without interference while\nstill giving the defense everything it is asking for well in advance of trial.\n\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\nGovernment’s request to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of these Materials.\n\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCc: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 2 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 2\nIndictment. Although the Government represented to this Court during the detention hearing that\n“the strength of the Government’s evidence” provided a strong incentive for Ms. Maxwell to\nflee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at\nthe initial hearing in this case. And, to the contrary, the dearth of evidence reinforces why Ms.\nMaxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her innocence and vehemently\ndenies the charges against her, as she has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations against her\nfirst surfaced.\n\nFurthermore, the Government’s production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC has\nbeen deficient and inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell only received the Government’s\nOctober 2, 2o2o production yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks after the production date,\nand she still cannot read all of the documents in the government’s prior productions. Defense\ncounsel have discussed these issues at length with the Government, and despite the\nGovernment’s assurances that it has spoken to the BOP and that the problems have been or will\nbe corrected, the problems persist. The defense has done what it can to alert the Government to\nthese issues so that they can be remedied, including three leters, three conference calls,\nnumerous emails, and countless hours of time and effort that should have been spent on\npreparing the defense. It should not be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility to intercede with the\nGovernment and the BOP to ensure that the discovery is produced on time and in a readable\nformat. The Government created these problems by insisting that Ms. Maxwell be detained\nbefore trial, and it is up to the Government to properly discharge its discovery obligations, which\nthey have not done.\n\nThe Government’s failure to produce relevant discovery in a timely manner, and in a\nformat that Ms. Maxwell can effectively review, is prejudicing her ability to investigate, prepare\nsubstantive motions, and defend against these charges. Given that these allegations are decades\nold and were investigated over many years by the Government prior to indictment, it should not\nhave been difficult for the Government to produce the relevant discovery by the appropriate\ndeadlines. Its October 7, 2o2o leter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and\nimpairment of Ms. Maxwell’s ability to defend herself.\n\nBackground Regarding the Lack of Substantive <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> by the Government Regarding\nCounts One Through Four?\n\nThe “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable because it fails to identify an\naccuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have commited a crime, or when\nanything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in the\nindictment are the years l994-l997. Fed.R.Crim.P. 7 provides that “[t]he indictment ... shall be a\nplain, concise and definite writen statement of the essential facts constituting the offense\ncharged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(l). A criminal defendant is entitled to an indictment that alleges\nthe essential elements of the charge against him. See Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232\n5 Similar discovery problems exist regarding Counts Five and Six. Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s non-involvement\nwith other Epstein accusers after l997 would, in fact, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because the\nmateriality of any statements must be evaluated in the context of the allegations made in the civil proceeding, i.e.,\npostl997.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001809.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 66 Filed lo/23/2o Page 5 of 7\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nOctober 23, 2o2o\nPage 5\ncame from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the\nexistence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from\nthe United States Atorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States\nAtomey’s Georgia office.\n\nIt is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand\nthe Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in\nthis case.” On the other hand, the Government’s leter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why\nthe Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The\nauthority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case\ndoes not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp.\n3d 228, 24l-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. l8 Cr. 36 (JPO),\n2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. l7, 2ol8) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,\n4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“NYSE”).\n\nThe Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this\nargument will be held on another day. It is troubling, houever, that instead of simply providing\nthe information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.\nMs. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.\n\nThe Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and\nPrejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.\n\nMs. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year\nfrom her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with\nfull discovery no later than November 9, 2o2o. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to\ninclude electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2o2o.” This representation nou\nseems incorrect. The Government, in its leter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why\nthe completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2o2o.\n\nMs. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2o2l, outside the time limits established by\nl8 U.S.C. § 3l6l, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient\ntime to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its leter to the Court the Government\nproposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important\nwitnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old\nclaims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material\nwitnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New\nYork. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided\nwith the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and\nconferred about the timing of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these\nissues with the Court.

Without\nsubstantive discovery Ms. Maxwell cannot be prepared to advance or meet any of these maters.\nThe Government Has Not Complied with Its Discovery Obligations to Ms. Maxwell in the\nMDC.\n\nSeting aside what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced\nto Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On\nAugust 27, 2o2o, after the Government had completed its first three discovery productions, the\ndefense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three\nproductions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had been sent to the\nMDC, and even proposed possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the\nproblem. Later that same day, the defense sent the Government a follou-up leter listing the\nunreadable documents and requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.\nMaxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could\naccess on her computer at the MDC, and shipped a new hard drive to load the replacement\nproduction.\n\nThe new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late\nafternoon of September 9, 2o2o, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously\nunreadable documents were fixed, Ms. Maxwell still could not access a substantial portion of the\ndiscovery materials. The defense sent another leter to the Government on September 2l, 2o2o,\nlisting the unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference\ncalls on September 22, 2o2o and September 29, 2o2o, the Government advised that it was\nworking on resolving the issues, but that the defense could, in the meantime, create its oun\nlaptop computer with a copy of the production that it could bring to the MDC to review the\ndiscovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it\nwas the Government’s responsibility to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete set of readable\ndiscovery which she could access at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.\n\nIt was not until October 2, 2o2o that the Government created a replacement set of the\nunreadable discovery, which it said it would include on the same hard drive as the next\nproduction of discovery materials. That production was only made available to Ms. Maxwell in\nthe MDC yesterday afternoon, almost three weeks since the production date. The Government\nalso advised that it had asked MDC legal counsel to send an IT staff member to examine the\ncomputer and load any necessary software to view the files on the existing hard drives. But the\nIT staff member did not look at the computer until October 7, and did not fix the problem.\nInstead, the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s computer and hard drives and kept them\nfor two days. When Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT staff member said he had been too\nbusy to look at them. And when they were finally returned to Ms. Maxwell in the afternoon on\nOctober 9, several files were still unreadable. As of the date of this leter, Ms. Maxwell still does\nnot have a complete, readable set of the discovery produced to date, which severely impairs her\nability to prepare her defense. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the Government to\naddress this problem immediately.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooool8lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00001814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 67 Filed lo/3o/2o Page 3 of 4\nPage 3\nrecent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the\ninitial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2o2o leter. Because the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,\nthey are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from\nits oun files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule l6\nmaterial and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning\nin August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.\n\nBy contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 leter, this\nProsecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August\n2o2o, received the materials identified in that leter from other prosecutor’s offices. The\nGovernment has nou obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule l6 discovery, but\nrather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to\nidentify any arguable 35oo or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady\nmaterial held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing\nthose materials, as set forth in its October 7 leter, and to the extent the Government identifies\nmaterial within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such\nmaterial in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial\ndisclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the\nGovernment will promptly produce it to the defense.\n\nIn sum, through its October 7 leter, the Government sought to be transparent about the\nfiles it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The\nGovernment fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and\nwill continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.\n\n2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and\n\nComplaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC\n\nThe Defense Leter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant\nlengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues\nthe defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The\nGovernment has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery\nthat is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal\ncounsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its oun IT\nstaff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files\n\n4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Leter is similarly\nmisleading. (Def. Ltr. l). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in\nthis case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the\nSouthern District of Florida,” (July l4, 2o2o Tr. at l2), and Government counsel clarified, “the\nfiles in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in\nconnection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at l4). Consistent with that\nrepresentation, the Government’s October 7, 2o2o leter noted that the Prosecution Team has\nreviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter to request that the Court grant the\nGovernment permission to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the defense of certain photographs of and documents\nregarding victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. These materials relate to abuse that post-\ndated the time period charged in the Indictment, and the Government does not intend to offer them\nat trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials to the defendant in advance\nof trial, premature <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of these materials could jeopardize the Government’s ongoing\ninvestigation and would reveal sensitive victim information months in advance of trial. For these\nreasons and as set forth belou, the Government respectfully submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), that good cause exists to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of these items to defense\ncounsel until eight weeks prior to trial.! The Government has conferred with defense counsel,\nwho have indicated that they object to this request and intend to submit a leter in opposition.\n\nAs the Court is aware, the superseding indictment in this case (the “Indictment”) charges\nthe defendant in six counts. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell with conspiring with\nEpstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C.\n\n' Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6 provides for the production of discovery to a defendant,\nupon request, of certain materials, such as documents that are material to the preparation of the\ndefense and documents the Government intends to use in its case-in-chief at trial. Houever, Rule\nl6(d)(l) also provides that:\n\nAt any time the court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer\n\ndiscovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief. The court\n\nmay permit a party to shou good cause by a writen statement that\n\nthe court will inspect ex parte.\nA finding of good cause “‘must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm,\nnot on conclusory statements.’” United States v.

Count Two of the Indictment charges Maxwell with enticing a minor to travel to engage in\nillegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2. Count Three of the Indictment charges\nMaxwell with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to participate in illegal sex\nacts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. §37l. Count Four of the Indictment charges Maxwell with\ntransporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2. Counts\nFive and Six charge Maxwell with perjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623. Counts One through\nFour focus on conduct between approximately l994 and l997.\n\nThe charges in the Indictment arose out of a broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual\nabuse of minors, which covered time periods beyond that included in the Indictment. During the\ncourse of that broader investigation, the Government has interviewed dozens of victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein. As part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a\nlimited number of sensitive documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were\nsexually abused by Epstein after l997 (the “Materials”). These Materials include, for example,\nschool photographs of certain victims and records, such as bank and travel records, for certain\nvictims. The Government does not anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this\ncase, and the Materials do not relate to individuals whom the Government currently anticipates\ncalling as witnesses at trial. Moreover, the Materials post-date the time period charged in the\nIndictment.\n\nThe Government has reviewed the Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and\nhas found none. Nevertheless, because the Government is taking an expansive approach to\ndisclosures in this case, the Government intends to produce these Materials to the defendant along\nwith 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses sufficiently in advance of trial in order to enable\nthe defendant to review and, if appropriate, make use of the Materials in her defense. In particular,\nthe Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to a protective order, statements of\nall witnesses the Government has interviewed during its broader investigation, even if the\nGovernment does not intend to call those witnesses at trial. Should the Court grant the instant\napplication, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements\npertaining to the victims identified in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by\nnon-testifying witnesses. The Government is prepared to make that production as early as eight\nweeks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to approximately 4o\nphotographs and approximately 4o pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials\nis unlikely to be unduly time consuming, thus minimizing any potential prejudice to the defendant\nfrom the delayed production.\n\nDelayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the Materials is warranted because they include identifying\ninformation for victims who are not expected to testify in this case and who have provided\ninformation as part of the Government’s ongoing investigation, the immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of which\nwould risk interfering with the Government’s ongoing investigation. See United States v.\nMannino, 48o F. Supp. ll82, ll88 (S.D.N.Y. l979) (permiting delayed production of documents\nwhose immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf’ United\nStates v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 5o6, 53l-32 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (risk of interference with ongoing\ninvestigation sufficient good cause for entry of Rule l6 protective order).

First,\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would tend to reveal to the defendant the scope of and evidence gathered during the\nGovernment’s ongoing investigation, the details of which are not currently public or knoun to the\ndefendant. Second, an order requiring the immediate production of these Materials would risk\ndeterring other victims from coming forward to be interviewed and from providing evidence to the\nGovernment. Victims who may be considering cooperating with the Government’s investigation\nmay decline to do so if they believe that the information they provide—even information outside\nthe period charged in the Indictment—must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case.\nGiven the sensitivity of the Materials, the need to protect the Government’s ongoing investigation,\nand the minimal (if any) relevance of the Materials to the offenses charged in the Indictment, the\nGovernment respectfully submits that good cause exists pursuant to Rule l6(d) to delay their\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nAccordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the\nGovernment’s request to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of these Materials.\nRespectfully submited,\nAUDREY STRAUSS\nActing United States Atorney\nMaurene Comey / Alison Moe / Lara Pomerantz\nAssistant United States Atorneys\nSouthern District of New York\nTel: (2l2) 637-2324\nCe: All Counsel of Record (By ECF)\nThere is no dispute that the materials referenced in the Government’s\nleter will be turned over to the defense.

The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete.

We have assisted in the preparation of this statement of financial condition in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)* on behalf of\nyour client Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n3. The information supplied by Ghislaine Maxwell’s office and by her spouse is\nincomplete due to the limited ability to access historic banking information from\nsome banks that have terminated their relationship either with Ghislaine Maxwell\nand/or her spouse. Houever, we are satisfied from the review we have carried out\nthat the absence of some contemporaneous documentary evidence does not invalidate\nor cast doubt on the conclusions we have reached nor on the overall reliability of the\nfinancial information as presented in the summary of the financial condition of\nGhislaine Maxwell.\n\n4. We are not able to perform a full audit of the statement of financial condition, nor\nhave we performed any audit type procedures, due to the current circumstances\nrelating both to the impact of the Covid-l9 pandemic and the conditions of the\ndetention of Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n5. Accordingly, our opinion is reliant on the information provided to us, which is\noutlined in paragraph l(i)-l(ill) above.\n\n' Tax returns filed for the years 2ol5-2o2o are atached as appendices to this report.\n* Atached as appendices to this report.\n> Relevant discovery materials reviewed pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order issued\nin United States v.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s net worth varied in the period under review.”\n\nl5. Ghislaine Maxwell and her spouse’s net worth at 3l October 2o2o is approximately\nUS$22,5oo,ooo. This is an estimate based on the 2ol9 tax filings to the end of\nDecember 2ol9 and review of bank statements and explanations provided by her\nspouse where bank statements are currently unavailable. This figure includes\napproximately $7.67m of advance legal retainer fees.\n\nl6. There has been no alienation of any assets in the period 2ol5-2o2o other than\nexpenditure in the ordinary course of family life and more recently since 2ol9 very\nsubstantial expenditure on professionals engaged in the defense of Ghislaine\nMaxwell from the criminal charges she faces.\n\nl7. In light of our inability to access all of the bank statements for the entire period for\nthe reasons already explained in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, we have not been able to\nreview every movement of cash from every account; we can, houever, deduce from\nstarting or opening balances and the closing balances that we have reviewed in each\nyear that no significant sum of cash has been transferred outside of the control of\nGhislaine Maxwell and or her spouse. All of the principal sources and uses of cash\nfrom 2ol5 through 2o2o are covered by this report of financial condition without\nexception.\n\nSummary of Specific Transfers and Accounts\n\nl8. We noted that accounts controlled either by Ghislaine Maxwell and/or her spouse,\neither directly or indirectly, maintained substantial cash and equity balances of\napproximately $l6 million during the period under review. The cash and equity\nbalances clearly increased from the time of the disposal of the New York property.\nThere are many examples of transfers between accounts, movements triggered by the\nclosure of one banking relationship and the opening of new relationship (examples\ninclude the movement of cash and assets from as well\nmovements of cash maturing on deposit and other financial investments.\n\nl9. In its initial bail submission, the Government referenced transfers totaling more than\n$2o million in the earlier period of 2oo7-2oll which the Government described as\ntransfers from Jeffrey Epstein’s accounts to Ghislaine Maxwell’s accounts and vice\nversa. We noted in our review of the financial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> materials, that during the\nperiod 2oo7-2oll Ghislaine Maxwell acted as an officer of various corporate entities\nrelated to aircraft and air travel associated with Jeffrey Epstein and we noted\nsubstantial transfers involving these corporate entities. We did not note any transfers\nof this nature or the nature described by the government in the 2ol5-2o2o period\nwhich forms the subject of our Financial Condition Report.\n\n> Macalvins prepared a report of financial condition for Ghislaine Maxwell dated April 3o\"\n2ol7 (see appendices to this report). The report recorded assets legally and beneficially\nouned by Ghislaine Maxwell on the balance sheet date. The specific liability recorded arose\nfrom a personal guarantee given by Ghislaine Maxwell. This mater was resolved by the year\nend of 2ol7 without diminution of assets.\n5|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 99 Filed l2/l8/2o Page—Lo - ;\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: l2/l8/2o __}\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The role of protective orders in civil litigation.\n\nProtective orders serve a “vital function” in civil litigation. Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel.\nCorp., 594 F.2d 29l, 295 (2d Cir. l979). They promote “the ‘secure the just, speedy, and\ninexpensive determination’ of civil disputes, by encouraging full <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all evidence.” /d.\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. l). “If protective orders were easily modified . . . parties would be less\nforthcoming in giving testimony and less willing to setle their disputes.” S.E.C. v.\nTheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o (2d Cir. 2ool). In particular, as here, “witnesses might be\nexpected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective orders if their testimony were to be\nmade available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those\norders.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295—96. Parties thus rely on protective orders, and courts strictly\nenforce them. See, e.g., Stewart v. Hudson Hall LLC, 2o Civ. 885 (SLC), 2o2o WL 7239676, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2o2o) (“In the Second Circuit, there is a strict standard for modification of\na protective order entered by a district court.” (citation and quotation marks omited)).\n\nThis case illustrates just hou crucial a protective order is. The Maxwell depositions\nsought highly intrusive evidence of the most personal aspects of Maxwell’s life. Her sexual\npractices. Her sexual preferences. Her sexual partners. In urging the district court to permit these\nextraordinary intrusions—in what should have been a simple defamation case\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2363\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002372.jpg": "Gaseli2PsceNOF4BARW DPasyauMnedBd2!

Ms. Maxwell argues\nl5 that her discussion of certain \"intimate maters\" during that\nl6 deposition should remain sealed.\n\nl7 During this deposition, Ms. Maxwell was asked\n\nl8 repeatedly about her oun sexual activity with consenting\n\nl9 adults. Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2ol6\n2o deposition, she provided testimony in response to those\nal questions. As noted earlier, the presumption of public access\n22 does atach to this transcript (although, has the Court has\n23 observed, to a lesser extent than if it were submited in\n24 connection with a dispositive motion).\n25 Here, houever, public access to certain parts of the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.ee\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2473\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002474.jpg": "LOAas6 W2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l36-9 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 33 7\n\nl transcript is outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's countervailing\n\n2 interests in resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the details of her\n\n5 private, intimate relationships with consenting adults. This\n\n4 testimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking\n5 and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute\n\n6 in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some\n7 may be left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in\n\n8 keeping private the details of her sexual relationships with\n\n9 consenting adults warrants the sealing of those portions of her\nlo testimony (and any materials that reference them).\n\nll For the sake of efficiency, my chambers will share\n\nl2 with the parties a copy of the transcript that highlights the\nl3 portions of Ms. Maxwell's deposition that should remain\n\nl4 redacted.

The Court finds, as it did for\n2o the last round of motions it considered for unsealing, that\n2l Ms. Giuffre's privacy interests in her medical records, where\n22 they reference the medical treatment she received, outweigh any\n23 public interests in those materials.

Ms.\nMaxwell has been prevented from knouing even the most fundamental information about the\nallegations against her, which are based on conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago.\nFirst and foremost, the government still has not disclosed the identities of the witnesses who\nhave accused Ms. Maxwell of wrongdoing. Despite requests to the government to disclose that\ncritical information, the government has refused to do so on the grounds that it needed to protect\nthe witness’ privacy, even though some of them, we believe, have publicly identified themselves\n' By leters, emails, and phone calls with government counsel, the parties have atempted to resolve pretrial\ndiscovery requests in advance of filing of pretrial motions. Unresolved requests are the subject of this motion.

Without this basic information, Ms. Maxwell\ncannot adequately investigate the allegations against her and prepare for trial.\n\nThe voluminous discovery provided by the government, which totals in the millions of\npages—the vast majority of which was produced to the defense in November 2o2o—does not\nshed any more light on the nature of the government proof or the specifics of the alleged\nconduct.” The discovery contains only a handful of documents that even pertain to the time\nperiod charged in the indictment (l994-l997), and what litle exists offers almost no information\nabout the details of, for example, exactly when and where the alleged incidents of sexual abuse\ntook place, who was allegedly present, and hou the alleged conduct violated the law. Without\nthese details, which Ms. Maxwell is requesting through a bill of particulars, she cannot identify\nrelevant witnesses or documents that she may wish to obtain to prepare her defense.\n\nIt is clear that the detail about hou these alleged offenses took place will come solely\nfrom the statements of the government’s witnesses. Accordingly, it is critical that Ms. Maxwell\nreceive Jencks Act material and the government’s witness list, as well as 4o4(b) evidence, well\nin advance of trial so that she can conduct an adequate investigation. The unique circumstances\nof this case more than warrant early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of this material. The conduct alleged in the\nindictment dates back 25 years, making investigation and preparation of the case complex and\ndifficult. The global COVID-l9 pandemic adds further complications and obstacles to trial\npreparation. The Court has recognized that Ms. Maxwell should be granted ample time to\nreview documents related to witnesses in this case. (See Dkt. 73 (ordering the government to\nproduce documents related to certain non-testifying witnesses by March l2, 2o2l “to ensure that\n* Ms. Maxwell is still reviewing the discovery, including the over two million pages produced in November 2o2o.\nIn deference to the Court’s schedule and in light of the trial date, we have not asked the Court to further extend the\ndeadline to file pretrial motions. Houever, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to supplement these motions at a later\ndate if her review of discovery uncovers documents that warrant additional requests.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2699\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002700.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 7 of 23\nthe defense can adequately prepare for trial”)). For the very same reasons, the Jencks Act and\n4o4(b) evidence should be produced to the defense no later than March l2, 2o2l.\n\nFor the reasons set forth belou, the Court should grant Ms. Maxwell’s request for a bill\nof particulars and her other requests for pretrial disclosures.\nI. Motion for a Bill of Particulars\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court direct the government to file a Bill of Particulars,\npursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, because the Superseding\nIndictment does not sufficiently inform her of the nature of the charges against her. Counts One\nthrough Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell\npurportedly enticed and caused unidentified individuals to travel to engage in illegal sex acts\nover a four-year period. But they provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took\nplace or what constituted the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is nou almost seven months\nsince Ms. Maxwell was arrested and the government s/i// has not even disclosed the identities of\nthe three accusers that form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through\nFour. Nor has the government alleged why Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly perjurious responses to\nthe deposition questions set forth in Counts Five and Six were material to the defamation\nproceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell cannot hope to investigate these allegations and\nadequately prepare for trial with such limited information. A bill of particulars is therefore\nwarranted.\n\nRule 7(f) permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars “in order to identify with\nsufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant\nto prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be\nprosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d 572, 574\n(2d Cir. l987). The decision of whether to grant a bill of particulars is within the discretion of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002701.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 8 of 23\nthe district court. /d. “In deciding whether a bill of particulars is needed, the court must\ndetermine whether the information sought has been provided elsewhere, such as in other items\nprovided by discovery, responses made to requests for particulars, prior proceedings, and the\nindictment itself.” United States v. Strawberry, 892 F. Supp. 5l9, 526 (S.D.N.Y. l995).\n\nMs. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not\nknouing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not knou who\nhas accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knouing this fundamental information, Ms.\nMaxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and atempt to investigate\nthese allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”\nBortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find\nout that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in\nfact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work\nand will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.\n\nAs we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to\ncompel pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here. See\nUnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975);° United States v. Warme, No.\nO9CRl9A, 2oo9 WL 427ll, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2o, 2oo9) (ordering government to disclose\nidentity of sex crime victim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against\nthis charge is significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged\nvictim’).

In Bortnovsky, the Second Circuit reversed the defendants’\nconvictions for failure to grant a bill of particulars, primarily because the indictment failed to\nidentify relevant dates. Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 574-75. The Circuit concluded that the\ndefendants, accused of submiting false burglary claims for insurance purposes, “were hindered\nin preparing their defense by the district court’s failure to compel the Government to reveal\ncrucial information: the dates of the fake burglaries and the identity of the three fraudulent\ndocuments.” /d. at 574. Asa result, Bortnovsky held, “[t]he relevance of key events was\nshrouded in mystery at the commencement of and throughout the trial.” Jd. at 575.\n\nMs. Maxwell is similarly hindered. The indictment charges Ms. Maxwell with enticing\nor arranging travel for an unidentified individual, Accuser-l,* from Florida to New York at some\npoint during a four-year period. Yet the government has not alleged the dates of Ms. Maxwell’s\nalleged interactions with Accuser-l, the dates when Accuser-l allegedly traveled across state\nlines for the purpose of engaging in sexual encounters with Jeffrey Epstein, the dates on which\nMs. Maxwell allegedly enticed the complainant to do so, and the actions Ms. Maxwell allegedly\ntook to entice Accuser-l to travel. Ms. Maxwell has requested precisely such particulars from\nthe government, and the government has declined to provide them.\n\nThis information also has not been provided in discovery. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment’s representation that accuser testimony is corroborated by “flight records, diary\nentries, business records, and other evidence,” (Dkt. 4 at 5), the government has not produced\nany such records from which it could be ascertained when or hou Ms. Maxwell is alleged to\n* The indictment identifies the three accusers as Minor Victims l-3.

Motion for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> and Inspection of Documents\n\nMs. Maxwell seeks an order directing the government to produce certain material\nbelieved to be in the possession of the government or its agents, or which could be obtained by\nthe government from other prosecutor’s offices, law enforcement officers and investigators,\nwitnesses, or persons having knouledge of the events giving rise to this case. Ms. Maxwell\nrequested these documents from the government, but was denied. As discussed further belou,\nMs. Maxwell has good reason to believe that some of these documents contain exculpatory\nBrady material; hence, the government has a duty to produce them to the defense, and should be\nordered to do so immediately. The alternative means of obtaining the requested documents\nwould be through subpoenas served on the government and unidentified witnesses, which is an\nimpractical pursuit. The government would likely move to quash any subpoena, requiring court\nintervention; and it would be impossible to serve subpoenas on witnesses without knouing their\nnames and locations. We therefore request that the Court direct the government to produce the\ndocuments set forth belou.\n\nA.

The government cannot absolve itself of its Brady obligations by\nproducing redacted documents “as is,” when they could easily obtain unredacted copies from the\nFBI. See Kyles v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 437 (l995) (the government “has a duty to learn of any\nfavorable evidence knoun to the others acting on the government’s behalf in the case, including\nthe police”). An informed witness who fails to mention the defendant when making a police\nreport is certainly exculpatory under Brady. United States v. Torres, 7l9 F.2d 549, 555-56 (2d\nCir. l983); Jones v.

As this Court ruled:\n\n“The Government must disclose to the defense all information ‘favorable\n\nto an accused’ that is “material either to guilt or to punishment’ and that is\n\nknoun to the Government. . . . The Government shall disclose such\n\ninformation to the defense promptly after its existence becomes knoun to\n\nthe Government so that the defense may make effective use of the\n\ninformation in the preparation of its case.”\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002708.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l5 of 23\n\nC. Documents Related to Ms. Maxwell’s Motions\n\nAlong with this motion, Ms. Maxwell has filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for\nbreach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein and two motions to\nsuppress the evidence obtained from the government’s subpoena of ae. These\nmotions request, as alternative relief, that the Court grant discovery and an evidentiary hearing\non the issues bearing on the motions. Ms. Maxwell asked the government for documents\nrelevant to these motions, but was denied. To the extent that the Court grants discovery related\nto these two motions, Ms. Maxwell requests, among other things, the documents requested in\nExhibit E, which were previously requested from the government. (See Ex. E).\n\nMs. Maxwell also requests the Court to order the government to produce a copy of the\nsubpoena that it issued to a. As set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s motion to suppress,\nMaxwell was not aware that the subpoena had been issued and never had the opportunity to\ncontest it. Ms. Maxwell seeks a copy of the subpoena to determine whether she has a basis to\nchallenge it.\n\nLikewise, for the reasons set forth in her motion to suppress, Ms. Maxwell requests that\nthe government produce copies of the other grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with this\ncase for the production of Ms. Maxwell’s private and confidential records. °\nIII. Motion for Immediate <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Brady and Giglio Material\n\nMs. Maxwell moves for an order, pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963)\nand its progeny, Kyles v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9 (l995), United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667\n(l985), and Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) compelling the government to\n° See Motion Under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell, and the Fifth Amendment to Suppress All Evidence\nObtained from the Government’s Subpoena i and to Dismiss Counts Five and Six.\n\nl]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002709.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l6 of 23\nimmediately disclose all potentially favorable evidence having a reasonable probability to\naffect the outcome of the proceedings. It is further requested that the Court direct the\ngovernment to disclose such information immediately upon its discovery.\n\nIt is well setled that pursuant to Brady and its progeny, the government must\ndisclose evidence, information, and facts that could be used to impeach its witnesses. See\nUnited States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 225 (2d Cir. 2oo7). Such evidence includes any\nand all evidence of a witness’ prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent\nstatements, and statements demonstrating a lack of knouledge or a denial of the facts of the\ncase or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct from which it\ncan be inferred the witness is untruthful.\n\nBut <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Brady material is not the end of the line. Quite the contrary, it is a\nlaunching point for an investigation that may bear critical information. In order to mount an\neffective defense, Ms. Maxwell must receive this material in sufficient time to investigate\nand develop it for effective use before and during trial. We therefore request the immediate\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all Brady and Giglio material.\n\nThe government takes the customary position that it will turn over any Gig/io material at\nthe time it provides prior statements of witnesses pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo. In doing so, the\ngovernment erroneously assumes that Gig/io material is something other than Brady material.\nThe Supreme Court has made clear that impeachment evidence “falls within the Brady rule.”\nBagley, 473 U.S. at 676 (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). Favorable evidence, generally referred\nto as Brady material, exculpates the accused or impeaches prosecution witnesses. /d. at 674,\n676; Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 28l-82 (l999), Boyete v.

Rather than risk a mistrial, the Court should require a proffer\nfrom the government or conduct a pretrial hearing to determine if the statements are admissible.\nV. Motion for Accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Witness Statements\n\nThe defense moves for accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness statements, pursuant to l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo (“Jencks Act”) and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. In\norder to properly investigate and prepare for trial, the defense will need the Jencks Act material\nwell in advance of trial. The allegations in this case date back 25 years. At the time of the\nalleged offenses, electronic recordkeeping was not prevalent. As a result, records and files,\nshould they still exist, may be archived or hard to retrieve. Moreover, the conduct alleged in the\nindictment purportedly took place in other states and in foreign countries over a four-year period.\nStatements pertaining to witnesses who are located outside United States will potentially require\ninternational travel to investigate. Foreign investigation may also require depositions, pursuant\nto Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, in the absence of subpoena pouer to\ncompel witness testimony in the United States. Investigation of witness statements is especially\nchallenging in light of the global pandemic that has imposed numerous constraints, including\nrestrictions on travel, mandated periods of quarantine, closure of public offices and businesses,\nand the reluctance of witnesses to meet in person. While these challenges cannot be eliminated\nentirely, early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> can help alleviate them and afford the defense a fair opportunity to\nmake use of the Jencks Act material.\n\nOn a case-by-case basis, courts can exercise their discretion and supervisory pouer to\nurge the production of Jencks Act material in advance of trial in the interests of judicial economy\nto avoid unnecessary delays during the course of the trial. See United States v. Percevault, 49o\nF.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974). The circumstances of this case — the age of the offenses, the\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002712.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page l9 of 23\nlocation of witnesses, the ongoing global pandemic — justify the accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Jencks\nAct material.\n\nThe Court has already recognized that the defense will need substantial time to evaluate\nand investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case. In response to the\ngovernment request to delay production of certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses until eight weeks prior to trial, the Court ruled that such a time frame was\n“insufficient” and ordered the government to produce the materials by March l2, 2o2l “to\nensure that the defense can adequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). The defense has conferred\nwith the government and proposed the same date—March l2, 2o2l—+to produce all Jencks Act\nmaterial for both testifying and non-testifying witnesses. The government has denied that\nrequest. Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the government to disclose all Jencks Act\nmaterial by that date, including, but not limited to the follouing:\n\nl. Any and all rough notes of witness interviews taken or obtained in any investigation\nof Ms. Maxwell, including federal, state, local and other investigations whether or not\nthe contents thereof have been incorporated in official reports;\n\n2. Any notes or memoranda made by government counsel, staff, or law enforcement\nagents during the interview of any witness intended to be called by the government in\nits direct case;\n\n3. Any emails, texts or voicemails (in original, transcribed and summary form) from the\nwitness and from the witness’s counsel/law firm containing information derived from\nany witness intended to be called by the government in its direct case; and\n\n4. Any emails, texts or voicemails (in original, transcribed and summary form) between\nand among government counsel and law enforcement officers containing information\nderived from any witness intended to be called by the government in its direct case.\n\nVI. Motion for a List of Government Witnesses\n\nIn conjunction with Ms. Maxwell’s request for early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Jencks Act material,\nthe defense also requests that the government provide a list of the witnesses it intends to call at\ntrial. Although Rule l6 does not require the government to disclose its witness prior to trial, the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002713.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2o of 23\nCourt may order the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> when a balancing of the defendant’s need for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and the\ngovernment's need for concealment indicates that such an order would be in the interests of\nJustice. See Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-o2. Trial courts generally exercise discretion to order\nsuch <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> upon a finding that a defendant’s request is material to the preparation of the case\nand is otherwise reasonable. See id. at 3oo-ol. Courts assess the materiality and reasonableness\nof the request through the application of a six-factor test set forth in United States v. Turkish, 458\nF. Supp. 874 (S.D.N.Y. l978):\n\nl. Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence?\n\n2. Have the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence?\n\n3. Will the evidence in the case largely consist of testimony relating to documents\n\n(which by their nature are not easily altered)?\n\n4. Is there a realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will\nincrease the likelihood that the prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or\nwill be unwilling to testify at trial?\n\n5. Does the indictment allege offenses occurring over an extended period of time,\nmaking preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?\n\n6. Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their\ndefense?\n\nId. at 88l.\n\nHere, the application of the Turkish factors favors early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses. The indictment does not allege crimes of violence, Ms. Maxwell has no\ncriminal history, and the government has conceded that she is not a danger to the community.\nThe age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed by a global pandemic makes\ninvestigation and preparation of this case complex and difficult. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of the government’s\nwitness list is material to the preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo27l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l48 Filed o2/o4/2l Page 2l of 23\nVII.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nOn February 26, 2o2l, the Government filed its omnibus memorandum of law opposing\nDefendants’ twelve pre-trial motions. It filed the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits,\nunder temporary seal pending the Court’s resolution of its request to redact sensitive or\nconfidential information. See Dkt. No. l62. On March 9, 2o2l, the Defendant objected to\ncertain of the redactions that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional\nredactions. Having considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the\nGovernment’s requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant’s additional\nredaction requests, with the exceptions discussed belou.\n\nTo begin with, the Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test articulated by the\nSecond Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under\nthis test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial\ndocuments;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;\nand (i) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o.\n“Such countervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law\nenforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.’” Jd. at\nl2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (““Amodeo I?’)).\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2762\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002764.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 3of5\nDefendant’s objections relate to her contention that some of the information contained in the\nredactions has been made public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions to which\nthe Defendant objects relate to the privacy interests of third parties, which the Second Circuit has\nadmonished “should weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.” United States v. Amodeo\n(“Amodeo IP’), 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995). At least some of the redactions to which the\nDefendant objects relate to private “family affairs” of a third party, a factor that “weigh[s] more\nheavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial portion of the public.” Jd. at lo5l.\nAnd though the Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions is\npublic, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nsignificant privacy interests at stake justify the limited and narrouly tailored redactions\ncontained in Exhibit 5.\n\nIn addition, the Court adopts the Defendant’s proposed additional redactions to pages\nl29-l34 of the Government’s brief. Those portions of the transcript, which were redacted in the\ncivil mater, concern privacy interests and their <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would merely serve to cater to a\n“craving for that which is sensational and impure.” Amodeo II, 7l F.3d at lo5l (citation\nomited). The Court thus concludes that such redactions are justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l-l28 of the Government’s brief. To provide some context, the redacted\nportions of the brief relate to sealed proceedings that took place before different judges relating\nto the issuance of grand jury subpoenas in connection with the present case. See Dkt. No. 5l.\nBecause the Government’s brief is a judicial document and because the presumption of access\nataches, the Government’s redaction requests must be “necessary to preserve higher values and\nonly if the sealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo2764\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document l68 Filed o3/l8/2l Page 4of5\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l24 (2d Cir. 2oo6). Courts have noted that “disclosing the details of\nthe Government’s efforts to obtain evidence will undoubtedly hamper the investigation, as the\nindividuals and entities under investigation would be put on notice.” United States v. Madoff,\n626 F. Supp. 2d 42o, 427-28 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9). And the Government’s interest in protecting an\nongoing investigation from the “danger of impairing law enforcement” may be a countervailing\nfactor that outweighs the presumption of access. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l2o. But the\nGovernment advances no non-conclusory basis as to why its investigation at this stage of the\nmater would be imperiled by the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the information regarding hou it obtained the\ninformation in question, and the requested redactions are far from narrouly tailored. As a result,\nthe Court denies the Government’s redaction requests in pages l-l28 and denies its request to\nfile Exhibits 8 and 9 under seal, since those documents relate to this very issue and the same\nreasoning applies to them. The Court will give the Government an opportunity to seek more\ntailored redactions if it wishes and to specifically justify the ongoing need to redact the requested\ninformation and documents. By March 22, 2o2l, the Government may file a leter with the\nCourt—under seal, if necessary—justifying the specific redaction and sealing requests.\nAlternatively, by that date the Government can indicate that it will not seek to renew the request.\n\nFurthermore, the Court agrees with the Defendant’s objections to the redactions\ncontained in pages l87-l88 of the Government’s brief. While the Court previously had granted\nthe request to redact the same information, see Dkt. No. 99, the Court no longer sees a basis for\nkeeping this information under seal in light of the strong presumption of access. The information\ndoes not in itself contain any personally identifying information, and the Court concludes that\nany minimal threat of interference with the Government’s investigation through the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nthis information is outweighed by the presumption of access that ataches to those portions.

The\nGovernment respectfully submits this leter (l) to identify the differences between the charges\ncontained in the S2 Indictment and the charges contained in the prior indictment, Sl 2o Cr. 33o\n(AJIN) (the “Sl Indictment’); (2) to address the impact, if any, of the S2 Indictment on the status\nof discovery and other disclosures; and (3) to address the impact of the S2 Indictment on the\ncurrently pending motions.\n\n' The Government noted in its February 26, 2o2l Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition\nto the Defendant’s Pretrial Motions that its investigation remained ongoing and that the\nGovernment would seek a superseding indictment no later than three months prior to trial. At this\njuncture, while the Government’s investigation is still ongoing, if trial remains set for July l2,\n2o2l as scheduled, then the Government does not intend to seek any further indictments in this\ncase. To the extent the Government uncovers additional evidence that it may seek to introduce at\ntrial, it will promptly disclose such evidence to the defense as either Rule l6 or Jencks Act material.\nAdditionally, the Government remains cognizant that its Brady obligations remain ongoing and\nwill promptly disclose any exculpatory evidence of which it becomes aware.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2867\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002869.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Documentl88 _ Filed o3/29/2l Page3of5\nPage 3\n\nCount Six of the S2 Indictment adds another new charge against the defendant.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo2926\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES001/DOJ-OGR-00002927.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o2 Filed o4/l5/2l Page 3 of 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“[O]f the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million.

It is for the jury to decide\nwhether the defendant commited perjury, and the motion should be denied. Sixth, the crimes in\nthe indictment should be tried together, as all six counts of the indictment are logically connected\nand provable through overlapping evidence. The Court should not sever this case, and thereby\nrequire victims of child sexual abuse to testify at multiple trials. Seventh, the Indictment\nindisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample\nnotice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to\nstrike any portion of it as surplusage. Ninth, the defense motion to dismiss one of the conspiracy\ncharges as multiplicitous is premature. Tenth, the defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars\nor any of the other early disclosures she seeks. Finally, the use of a grand jury siting in White\nPlains to return the Indictment in this case was entirely proper.\n\nBACKGROUND\nOn June 29, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned an indictment charging the\ndefendant in six counts. On July 2, 2o2o, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’) arrested the\ndefendant. On July 8, 2o2o, a grand jury siting in this District returned a superseding indictment\n(the “Indictment” containing the same charges, with ministerial corrections. (Dkt. No. l7). Count\nOne of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to\nentice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § 37l. Count Two\ncharges the defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, and aiding and\nabeting the same, in violation l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count Three charges the defendant with\nconspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation\nof l8 U.S.C. § 37l.

She has “offered no credible\nevidence to suggest that the Government tarried in bringing charges against [her] solely to gain\nsome prosecutorial advantage.” Pierre-Louis, 2ol8 WL 4o43l4o, at *5. As such, because the\ndefendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of shouing both actual prejudice and unjustifiable\nGovernment conduct, her motion to dismiss the Indictment for pre-indictment delay should be\ndenied.”\n\nIV. The Court Should Deny the Defendant’s Motions to Suppress\n\nThe defendant moves to suppress evidence the Government obtained pursuant to a grand\njury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller and to dismiss Counts Five and Six under the Due Process\nClause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell v. Int’l Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979). (Def. Mots. 3 & ll). In\nparticular, the defendant contends that the Government violated the Second Circuit’s decision in\nMartindell and misled Chief Judge McMahon in obtaining the modification of a protective order.\nShe also contends the subpoena was overly broad and amounted to an unlawful search of materials\nin which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, as well as an infringement of her privilege\nagainst self-incrimination. Although the defendant styles her request for relief as two separate\n°5 The defendant asks the Court for leave to supplement her motion “after the government provides\nher with meaningful discovery” and notes that “after the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of meaningful discovery, [she]\nmay request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until after any trial if the indictment has not\nbeen dismissed on other grounds.” (Def. Mot. 7 at l). As noted above and discussed further in\nSection X, infra, the Government has complied with its Rule l6 obligations and will produce\nGiglio and Jencks Act materials well in advance of trial. The Court should reject the defendant’s\ninvitation to defer ruling on this motion. See, e.g., United States v. Muric, No. lo Cr. ll2 (LTS),\n2olo WL 289ll78, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July l3, 2olo) (“The motion to dismiss the Indictment as the\nresult of pre-indictment delay is therefore denied, without prejudice to appropriately supported\nlater motion practice.”); United States v. Drago, No. l8 Cr. o394 (SJF) (AYS), 2ol9 WL 3o72288,\nat *2 (E.D.N.Y.

(/d. at 3). She stated that were the Government’s application disclosed\nto the parties, “Maxwell would protest” and argue that the Government lacked standing as it was\nnot a party to the protective order. (/d. at 8). In response to questions from Chief Judge McMahon,\nthe Government explained that the protective order, on its face, did not implicate the types of\nconfidential business information or trade secrets ordinarily considered by courts in conducting\nthe Martindell balancing test. (/d. at l3).\n\nChief Judge McMahon stated that the protective order did not contain a provision allouing\na party to the order to disclose materials requested by law enforcement without permission of the\ncourt, noting her understanding that “it may have been negotiated out.” (/d. at l4-l5). The court\ninquired whether the Government’s position was that “reliance on the nondisclosure of\nconfidential materials to law enforcement in connection with a grand jury subpoena that has been\nduly authorized would be unreasonable.” (/d. at l4). The Government responded in the\naffirmative, stating that the Government believed a provision precluding compliance with a law\nenforcement request would be void for public policy. (Ud. at l5). The Government further cited\nChemical Bank in support of the proposition that it would be unreasonable to rely on a protective\norder provision that barred the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information to law enforcement. (/d. at l5-l6).\n\nIn response to questions about the breadth of the subpoena, the Government explained that\nit was “essentially unable to significantly narrou the request for information ... . We have either\nlitle or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are [and]\nwho was deposed.” (/d. at l7). In response to Chief Judge McMahon’s question about the privacy\ninterests implicated by the protective order, (id. at l6-l7), the Government also noted that it was\ndissimilar to an ordinary third-party intervenor in that it would be “extremely restricted” in its use\n\n69\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003033.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 99 of 239\n\nOn or about April 9, 2ol9, Chief Judge McMahon granted the Government’s application\nand issued a memorandum and order. (Def. Mot. 3, Exs. F & G). The Court noted that while the\nGovernment’s application was procedurally “[i]rregular,” there was precedent for granting the\nGovernment’s request and, therefore, the Court would consider the application. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.\nG at 6, 8-9). The Court found that, contrary to the Government’s arguments, it was appropriate\nfor the Court to analyze the Government’s application in light of the Martindell factors. (/d. at 9-\nl2).\n\nIn so doing, Chief Judge McMahon considered, among other things, “the degree to which\n. . . the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing[] reasonably relied on the protective\norder.” (/d. at l6). She concluded that such reliance was unreasonable. (/d. at 22). She evaluated\nthe factors under Second Circuit case law that are relevant to assessing whether a party’s reliance\non the protective order was reasonable, namely the scope of the protective order, the language of\nthe order itself, the court’s level of inquiry before granting the order, and the nature of reliance on\nthe order. (/d. at l7). She concluded that first three factors favored granting the Government’s\napplication for modification. (/d. at l7-2o). Chief Judge McMahon noted that, as the order\n“plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to anyone—law\nenforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic\npermission for such <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to shield anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s\nscrutiny.” (/d. at l8-l9).\n\nAs to the last factor, Chief Judge McMahon found that “the nature of the parties’ reliance\non the order does seem to weigh against modification.” (/d. at 2o). She noted that the record\nindicated that “Giuffre likely could not have secured Maxwell’s deposition—at least in the absence\nof substantial court involvement—without” the protective order. (/d.). “Houever, the only thing\n\n72\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o33\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003034.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page loo of 239\n\non which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is that Giuffre or her lawyers would\nnot do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, forward discovery materials in their\npossession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with\nthat situation.” (/d. at 2l). Chief Judge McMahon further stated, “Nothing in this record suggests\nto me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene\na grand jury to look into the maters that were the subject of the [civil lawsuit].” (Ud.). Instead,\nshe explained that the Government informed the Court that it had “contacted Boies Schiller as part\nof its search for parties who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller\ntold the Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files\nbecause of the existence of the Protective Order.” (/d.). Chief Judge McMahon concluded that it\nwas “quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation.” (/d.).\n\nAmong other conclusions, Chief Judge McMahon found that because Maxwell’s reliance\non the protective order in that case as a “shield [. . .] from the court-ordered <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nConfidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the Court may\nexercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further\nconcluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,\nwhich would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other\ncircumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, here the Government is in no\nposition to narrou its request, because [the civil case] was litigated almost entirely under seal.”\n(Id. at 25).\n\nChief Judge McMahon permited that the Government share the order—and only that\norder, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials\nassociated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was\n\n73\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3o34\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003039.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo5 of 239\ninformation protected thereunder, it was error for the district court to modify the magistrate’s\norders”).\n\nAt the same time, in Martindell, the court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party upon\nprotection of pre-existing documents from <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the Government would normally be more\ndifficult to justify than that of a witness who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his\nprivilege and given no testimony at all.” /d. at 297 n.8; see also United States v. Davis, 7o2 F.2d\n4l8, 422-23 (2d Cir. l983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of a grand\njury subpoena where “there [was] no indication that [a witness] agreed to testify only in reliance\non [an] ‘understanding”” of confidentiality and where many records sought “existed prior to the\nadvent of the litigation”). In subsequent cases, the Second Circuit has clarified that the Martindell\npresumption comes into play only when a party reasonably relies on a protective order in providing\ndeposition testimony. See, e.g., Davis, 7o2 F.2d 4l8; SEC v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-\n3l (2d Cir. 2ool) (stating that “some protective orders may not merit a strong presumption against\nmodification,” as the nature of some orders “may not justify reliance by the parties”).\n\nIn United States v. Davis, the Second Circuit explained that “[r]anged against these\nconsiderations [relating to the policy in favor of enforcing Rule 26(c) protective orders] are the\nreasons for permiting the grand jury broad subpoena pouer in a criminal investigation.” 7o2 F.2d\nat 42l. The Second Circuit noted the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected\nviolations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production\nof documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” J/d. at 42l-22\n(citing United States v. Calandra, 4l4 U.S. 338, 343 (l974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence\nis vital to the grand jury’s investigative function.” Jd. at 422; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S.\n665, 688 (l972) (“Although the pouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the\n\n78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page lo7 of 239\npublic interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious\ncrime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not\npublicly knoun, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify\nand to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”\n(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request\nwas made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of\nan ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri\nwhere the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the\nstate Atorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. ll at l4).\nMaxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court\nerred by not expressly finding that the state had shoun improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,\nor compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,\n866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.\n\nJudge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional\ncircumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.\n3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether\nexceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary\nfindings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed\nthe law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shous that there are\nguardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no\n\n8o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll of 239\ni. Discussion\n\nMaxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate\nexpectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential\nunder the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her\nadversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation\nof privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no\nlegitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is\nrevealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, l38 S. Ct.\nat 222o (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority\nfor the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena\ndirected at a third party law firm, because there is none.\n\nMaxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the\nprotective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. ll at 6-8). Martindell by its oun terms\ncontemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data\nServs., 876 F.2d at lo83 (“It is well-setled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective\norder may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary\ncircumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,\nChief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an\norder compelling <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not\nreasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to shield\nanything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at l8-l9); see\nalso Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the\nconsent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003059.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l25 of 239\nto produce documents, the contents of which are not privileged, where the act of production is,\nitself, (l) compelled, (2) testimonial, and (3) incriminating.” Jn re Three Grand Jury Subpoenas\nDuces Tecum Dated Jan. 29, l999, l9l F.3d l73, l78 (2d Cir. l999).\n\nConsistent with these requirements, the privilege only “prohibits the compelled <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof documents when the act of production has independent communicative aspects—such as an\nadmission that the documents exist, that the subject possesses or controls the documents, that the\ndocuments are authentic, or that the subject believes the documents are responsive to the\nsubpoena.” Jn re Various Grand Jury Subpoenas, 924 F.

The Fifth Amendment — When Private Action Is Deemed\nGovernment Action\n\nAs discussed above, “[t]he sole concern of the Fifth Amendment . . . is governmental\ncoercion.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at l7o. “[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned ‘with\nmoral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official\ncoercion.’” Jd.

For this reason, even “[t]he most outrageous\n\n98\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3o59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003115.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page l8l of 239\n\nis particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,\nJudge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be\ncontained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be\nequally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follous\nhere. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through\nFour is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the\ndefendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided\nthe defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each\nvictim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its\nwitnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the\nsame offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in\nthe Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n\nSecond, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct\nalleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 5l3 F.2d\nat ll3). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a\ncontinuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to\ncommit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about l994 and in or about\nl997. See Indictment 7 l, 6, 7, 9-ll, l3, l5-l7, l9. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently\nupheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.\nSupp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to\ndescribe the windou of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v.

Houever, the\nGovernment has provided such information, and much more, in the Indictment, extensive\ndiscovery, and various pretrial filings, including this memorandum. The defendant will also\nreceive trial exhibits, a witness list, and Jencks Act material reasonably in advance of trial. As\nsuch, she has not established an entitlement to a bill of particulars under well-established governing\nlaw.\n\nl.

Moreover, where the\nGovernment’s provision of particulars is tantamount to an itemized preview of its proof, it creates\nthe very real danger that a defendant will “tailor her testimony to explain away the Government’s\ncase.” Henry, 86l F.

The charges against the defendant\nare clear from the face of the Indictment, which provides significant detail regarding the charged\ncrimes. As is apparent from the l8-page Indictment, the charges concern the defendant’s\nparticipation in conspiracies to transport and entice minor girls to travel with the intent that they\nengage in illegal sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein from l994 through l997, and the defendant’s atempt\nto cover up that conduct during her civil deposition testimony in 2ol6. Specifically, the Indictment\nmakes plain that the defendant is charged with engaging in a conspiracy to transport minor girls\nwith intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, engaging in a conspiracy to entice\n\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2lo of 239\nCir. l99o). Thus, “‘[iJn the absence of a specific shouing that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> [of a witness list] [is]\nboth material to the preparation of [the] defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances\nsurrounding [the] case,’ the request for a witness list should be denied.” United States v.

The Defendant’s Additional Requests for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Should Be Denied\n\nThe defendant also makes a variety of motions seeking disclosures to which she is not\nentitled, all of which should be denied.\nee. which the defense atached to their motion as Exhibit B. (Def. Mot.\nlo at 7-8). The defense assumes that because ee\nre thereby, according to the defense, rendering any record of\nthose interviews exculpatory. But that defense theory rests on a faulty premise. The Government\nhas reviewed the document memorializing De and\nconfirmed that it incu/pates the defendant and contains nothing exculpatory. The Government has\nconfirmed that it also inculpates the defendant. The Government has, houever, identified a single\nline i i _ that could arguably be considered helpful to\nthe defense.© With the possible exception of that one line, there is nothing exculpatory contained\n6 The Government has requested reciprocal discovery from the defendant and, to date, she has\nproduced nothing.\n\nl85\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l3 of 239\nthese interviews constitute witness statements covered by the Jencks Act and are not subject to\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> by statute until after each witness has completed direct examination at trial. See l8\nU.S.C. § 35oo. As noted above, houever, the Government fully intends to provide all Jencks Act\nmaterial of both testifying and non-testifying witnesses, which will of course include the records\nrelating to these interviews, to the defense multiple weeks in advance of trial. The Government\nrespectfully submits that is sufficient to meet its obligations with respect to these documents, and\nthe defendant’s motion for their immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> should be denied.\n\nSecond, the defendant’s request for an unredacted copy of the FBI report atached to the\nDefense Motion as Exhibit C should be denied as moot because the Government has already\nproduced an unredacted copy of that report to the defense. (Def. Mot. lo at 8-9). Specifically, the\ndocument was produced without redactions under bates numbers SDNY _GM_ oo38o55o through\nSDNY_GM_oo38o554 as part of the Government’s discovery production dated November 9,\n2o2o.° This motion should accordingly be denied as moot.\n\nThird, the defendant’s request for unredacted copies of the FBI report regarding ||\nee is based purely on her speculation that the redacted portions\nof those materials contain exculpatory information. (Def. Mot. lo at 8-9). Once again, the\na. Out of an abundance of caution, today the Government has informed defense counsel\nOrn cr\n6° Notably, the unredacted report does not contain ed\na demonstrating that defense counsel’s speculation about\nsupposed Brady material lurking beneath redactions is inaccurate. The redacted copy defense\ncounsel atached as Exhibit C was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for one of\nEpstein’s devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was recovered from\nthe device. In other words, defense counsel has received two copies of this same document: the\nredacted version that Epstein had on one of his devices, and the unredacted version from the FBI’s\nfiles.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003148.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l4 of 239\nGovernment has reviewed the full report and confirmed that there is nothing exculpatory contained\ntherein. To the contrary, the report inculpates the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is not\nentitled to its immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. The Government will produce an unredacted version of this\ndocument together with all other witness statements in advance of trial.®”\n\nFourth, the defense requests production of pages from a personal diary that is in the custody\nof a civilian third party and is not in the custody or control of the Government. (Def. Mot. lo at\nlo). Leaving aside the fact that the defense cites no authority for the proposition that the\nGovernment has an obligation to obtain the personal papers of a third party, see United States v.\nCollins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (“The Government’s ‘Brady obligations extend\nonly to materials within prosecutors’ possession, custody or control or, in appropriate cases, that\nof the Department of Justice, perhaps another part of the Executive Branch, or a comparable state\nauthority involved in the federal prosecution.’” (quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 3o8 F. Supp.\n3d 736, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8))), the Government has already represented that it has asked the third\nparty at issue about the materials the defendant purports to seek and that no such materials exist.\nIn particular, to the extent the defense is concerned with whether there are diary entries from the\nspring of l996, the Government has already indicated in response to the defendant’s second bail\nmotion that it is aware of none. (See Dkt. No. loo at ll n. 2 (“Because this victim stopped writing\nin her journal about a month after that first meeting with Epstein, there are no entries regarding the\nsubsequent trip she took months later to visit Epstein, during which she met the defendant. This\nvictim provided the Government with copies of her journal entries relating to Epstein and informed.\nthe Government that the remaining entries are personal in nature and have nothing to do with\n®” As is the case with the other redacted document referenced in this motion, the redacted copy\ndefense counsel atached as Exhibit D was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for\none of Epstein’s devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was\nrecovered from the device.\n\nl87\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l48\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003149.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l5 of 239\nEpstein or the defendant.”)). In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory\nevidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this\nrepresentation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be\ndenied.\n\nFifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the\nGovernment to produce copies of a// subpoenas it has issued for the defendant’s records as part of\nits investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. lo at ll). This incredibly broad request is nothing more\nthan a fishing expedition inappropriately seeking the details of investigative requests made through\nthe grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government\nto provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other\nmaterials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the\ndefendant’s records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of\nrequests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the\ndefense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable\nmaterial that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In\nthe absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the\nreasons discussed above in Sections I and I'V, the defendant is not entitled to discovery or a hearing\nrelating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress\nsubpoena returns.\n\nSixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any\nBrady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. lo at ll-l3). The motion for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Brady material\nshould be denied as moot because the Government has conducted a search for any such material\nand has already disclosed any potentially exculpatory information in its possession of which it is\n\nl88\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l49\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003150.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l6 of 239\naware, consistent with the Rule 5(f) Brady order previously issued by the Court in this case. See\nFed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); Dkt. No. 68. The Government recognizes its continuing obligation to\ndisclose any Brady material, and to make a diligent search for any relevant material that may be\nin the possession of the prosecution team, including investigating agents and officers. As the\nGovernment has already emphasized in this case, the Government takes its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations\nvery seriously and has commited to being transparent with the Court and the defense regarding its\napproach to obtaining and reviewing files, including other agency files, that may be relevant to\nthis case. (See, e.g., Gov’t Leter dated October 7, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 63). Consistent with that\ncommitment, the Government has completed an initial review of its files for Brady material and\nRule l6 material and has produced more than 2.7 million pages of discovery as a result of that\nreview. These productions have included specific disclosures of certain witness statements that\nmay arguably be exculpatory. The Government also intends to produce all statements and potential\nimpeachment material in its possession regarding any potential witness identified during its\ninvestigation, including those individuals whom the Government does not intend to call at trial.\nAs discussed belou, the Government is in the process of reviewing all files in its possession for\npotential impeachment material. The Government remains cognizant of its Brady obligations and\nwill promptly produce any potentially exculpatory material if any is identified during that review.\n\nThe Government is not currently aware of any undisclosed Brady material in its possession,\nbut it will certainly provide timely <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any additional Brady material if any such material\ncomes to light. Courts in this Circuit routinely deny specific requests for Brady material where,\nas here, the Government has made a good-faith representation to the court and defense counsel\nthat it recognizes and has complied with its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations under Brady. See, e.g.,\nThompson, 2ol3 WL 6246489 at *9 (“In light of the Government's ‘good-faith representation to\nl89\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l5o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003151.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l7 of 239\n\nthe court and defense counsel that it recognizes and has complied with its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations\nunder Brady,’ defendants’ request for immediate or otherwise early\nproduction of Brady materials is denied.” (internal citation omited) (quoting United States v.\nPerez, 94o F. Supp. 54o, 553 (S.D.N. Y.l996))); Gallo, l999 WL 9848, at *8 (denying defendant’s\nmotion to compel production of purported Brady material based on Government’s representations\nthat “it is aware of its obligations under Brady .. . and will produce any Brady material to the\ndefense well before trial”); United States v.

Oct. l2, 2ol6) (“The Government represents that it is aware of its\nobligation under Brady; that it has complied; and will continue to comply. That is sufficient to\ndeny Defendants’ motion for Brady relief.” (internal citations omited)). Given the Government’s\nextensive efforts to review its files for any material warranting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and its commitment to\ncontinue meeting its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, the motion should be denied.\n\nFor similar reasons, the motion for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Giglio material should be denied as\npremature. The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is\nin the process of reviewing all files in its possession for any such material, and will produce any\nsuch material several weeks in advance of trial. As noted above, that is consistent with governing\nlaw in this Circuit, and the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that she is entitled to\nsuch material as much as four months in advance of trial. Courts in this Circuit have repeatedly\nrefused to compel <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of impeachment or Giglio material well in advance of trial, and the\ndefense has provided no particularized basis for even earlier <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> here.

At the time of those disclosures, to the extent that Defendants feel that additional\ntime is necessary given the volume or complexity of the materials provided, the Court will\nconsider applications to continue or recall witnesses.

Accordingly, this motion should be denied.\nXI. =‘ The Use of a Grand Jury Siting in White Plains Was Entirely Proper\n\nOn June 29, 2o2o, amidst a global pandemic that suspended grand juries across the country,\nthe Government sought and obtained an indictment from a grand jury of the Southern District of\nNew York (the “Southern District” or “SDNY”) siting in White Plains. The defendant nou\nchallenges the pool from which that grand jury was drawn, alleging that it does not reflect a “fair-\ncross section of the community,” and moves to dismiss the Indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment. (Def. Mot. 9 at l). As set forth belou, the defendant’s arguments rely on faulty\n\nl93\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003274.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 98 of 348\nwe go that route, would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecution agreement public?”\nVillafafia replied that while a federal plea agreement would be part of the court file and publicly\naccessible, the NPA “would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part\nof our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “‘for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3285\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003286.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page llo of 348\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3286\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.'°! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3288\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003347.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page l7l of 348\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7\"\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3347\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003388.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003403.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.” 7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*? She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003407.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”°\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo34o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . | was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVU. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo34o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003442.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.*”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?”7\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003462.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3462\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003474.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 298 of 348\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”* Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.”\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo348l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 333 of 348\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is well knoun to the Bar, in part because <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Guiffre, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 62) at 2 (defining\n“confidential” information simply as “information that is confidential and implicates common law\nand statutory privacy interests of (a) plaintiff Virginia Roberts Guiffre and (b) defendant Ghislaine\nMaxwell” and making no reference to trade secrets or other confidential business information).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo849\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003547.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-8 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In sucha case, ““[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’\"” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 5 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—trelied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed.

In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and Application, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide protection against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebuted\nand the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.\n\n* An application of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of\nwitnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in\nthe course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo85l\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3548\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003552.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\nIndeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically rejected judicial protection for the type of\ninformation the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:\n\nAvoiding embarrassment may be a reason for a party to seek\n\nconfidentiality.

But aside from those\n\nrestrictions, hiding possible criminal violations from law\n\nenforcement authorities is hardly a ground for judicial protection of\n\nconfidentiality.\nChemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on confidentiality\nagreements and protective orders generally, such classification “is not binding on the court” and\nthe “risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is well knoun to the Bar, in part because <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may be required where\nsuch information is needed for judicial decisions, to the basis for which the public should have\naccess. Jd. (collecting cases).\n\nUnder some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test to evaluate\nthe government’s ability to obtain access to materials covered by a protective order. Specifically,\nin Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 29l (2d Cir. l979), the government\ninformally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—sought access to discovery materials from\na civil litigation. The Court held that the Government was not entitled to the materials unless it\ncould shou either that the protective order was improvidently granted or some extraordinary\ncircumstance or compelling need for the material; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces\nTecum Dated Apr. l9, l99l (“Subpoena Duces Tecum”), 945 F.2d l22l, l224 (2d Cir. l99l) (in\nconnection with bankruptcy proceeding, and citing Martindell, vacating denial of a motion to\nquash a grand jury subpoena seeking production of documents subject to protective order and\nremanding for determination of shouing that the order was improvidently granted or of\nextraordinary circumstance or compelling need).\n\nAs an initial mater, the Court need not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This is\nso for two reasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test generally relate to\nmotions to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or else instances where the\nGovernment sought protected information without such grand jury process. See Martindell, 594\nF.2d 29l (in which the government informally, and without use of a grand jury subpoena, sought\naccess to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (vacating denial of a\nmotion to quash a grand jury subpoena). Here, there is no such deficiency in the form of request\nnor a challenge by the recipient of the subpoena. Indeed, in Chemical Bank, which cited\nMartindell, the district court opined that had the Government obtained judicial relief to issue an\nsuch as documents and depositions are not likely to include the kind of confidential business\ninformation that Chemical Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult\nbalancing.” See id.; see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. l77) (defining\n“confidential” information as, in sum and substance, medical and psychological information,\npersonal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo92l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3552\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003553.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\nuncontested subpoena for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be\nappropriate. Chemical Bank, l54 F.R.D. at 94.\n\nSecond, any presumption against modification of a protective order is unreasonable where,\nas here, the protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that are\non their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the parties [and] in such\ncircumstances reliance may be unreasonable.” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 23o-3l (2d\nCir. 2ool). “Where a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of\na protective order”—for example, where such an order was limited to the pretrial stages of\nlitigation—“a court may properly permit modification of the order.” Jd. (citing In re “Agent\nOrange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 82l F.2d l39, l47 (2d Cir. l987)); see also Allen v. City of New York,\n42o F.Supp.2d 295, 3ol (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (Mag. J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently-situated\ninterests of civil litigants but where, as here, the relevant protective order specified that a party\ncould object to the designation of a document as confidential, and was also temporary or limited\non its face). In such a case, “‘[w]hether to lift or modify a protective order is a decision commited\nto the sound discretion of the trial court.’*” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l (modification in\noriginal) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 82l F.3d at l47) (additional citations omited). Here, the\nparties in the Litigation explicitly contemplated the public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of such information at trial\nby the very terms of the Protective Order, thereby establishing precisely the kind of temporal limit\ndescribed above. See Prot. Order at 6 (“This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on\nthe use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this mater.”). The parties could not\nhave—as, for example, they might in a bankruptcy proceeding such as in Subpoena Duces\nTecum—relied upon the Protective Order to indefinitely keep the relevant materials hidden.\n\nIn this case, where the Protective Order is limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages\nof the civil litigation, no confidential business information appears to be at issue, and counsel for\nthe victims of the suspected crimes being investigated have indicated a willingness to voluntarily\ncomply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 23l,\nmilitates overwhelmingly touard limited, narrou modification of the Protective Order to permit\ncompliance with the Subpoena.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority\nto inquire into suspected violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may\ncompel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems\nnecessary.” Jd. at 42l-22; see Branzburg v. Hayes, 4o8 U.S. 665, 688 (l972) (“Although the\npouers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge, the\nlongstanding principle that ‘the public . . . has a right to every man’s evidence,’ except for those\n* The Government notes that any materials produced pursuant to a grand jury subpoena fall under\nthe protections and restrictions set forth in Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e), and further notes and emphasizes\nthat the proposed order accompanying the Application provides no additional exception or\nmodification to the Protective Order as to the recipient of the subpoena other than the narrou,\nlimited ability to comply with grand jury process. The Protective Order will remain otherwise\nintact and fully enforceable.\n\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo922\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3553\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003554.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\npersons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege is particularly applicable\nto grand jury proceedings.”) (citations omited).\n\nFinally, even were the Court to apply the Martindell test here,* despite the significant\ndistinguishing factors described above, this Investigation is a paradigmatic example of\nextraordinary circumstances. In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture\nof the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies\nSchiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,\nif a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.\nBut it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.\n\nAdditionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation\nin this district is not publicly knoun. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the\nInvestigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly\naware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury pouer to “subpoena witnesses to testify,\nregardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil\nlitigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—and the\npossibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to\ndestroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that\ncaused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application. Cf Subpoena Duces\nTecum, 945 F.2d at l224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued\nthat the government could not meet its burden of shouing need for deposition testimony until it\nhad at least called the witness before the grand jury).\n\nThe subject mater of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of\nthe Government’s Investigation and Application, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not\nto be of the sort that ordinarily would provide protection against Government investigation. See\n> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described\nabove, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned\ndecisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have\neach adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective\norder exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487\nU.S. l24o (l988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d\nl222, l226-l227 (9th Cir. l995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d lol3, lo2o\n(llth Cir. l993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively\nunworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First\nand Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to\nquash the subpoena shous “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the\nsubpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), l38 F.3d 442, 445 (lst\nCir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (l998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d l53, l57-l58 (3d Cir.\n2oo2). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebuted\nand the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.\n\n* An application of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of\nwitnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in\nthe course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.\nCO N F | D F N T | A [L SDNY_GM_ooooo923\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3554\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003682.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 8of34\n\nC. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3682\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003695.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “‘in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Jd. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3695\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003702.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 34\n(PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting cases). The Court therefore\ndenies Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\n\nVIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures\n\nMaxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it\nhas in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nGovernment’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator\nstatements, and Rule 4o4(b) material. Based on the Government’s response in briefing and\nleters the parties have since submited to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have\nbeen overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not\nentitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will\nrequire the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all\n\nBrady and Giglio Material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v.\nUnited States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain\nevidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of exculpatory evidence. Under\nGiglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also\ninformation that could be used to impeach a key government witness.” United States v. Coppa,\n267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). As a general rule, “Brady and\nits progeny do not require immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all exculpatory and impeachment material\nupon request by a defendant.” J/d. at l46. “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in\ntime for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law\nsimply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.” /d. at l44.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR- oooo37o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003703.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003704.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003705.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003706.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require resolution\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all of the above\nmaterials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo37o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003707.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document2o7 _ Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33 of 34\nGiven the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the\nCourt encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks.\n\nIX. The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell’s grand jury challenge\n\nThe Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of\nthe S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.! Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion seeking to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury\nsiting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury\ndrawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity, because her trial would proceed in the Manhatan Division. A grand jury siting in\nManhatan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 2l, 2o2l, Maxwell shall shou\ncause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the\nstatute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No.\nl37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the\nperjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt.

Indeed,\nmany of the arguments made by the government in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions reveal\nnew information that undercut its claims about the origins of, and motives behind, this\nprosecution.\n\nMs. Maxwell raised this issue pretrial, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P l2(b)(3)(A)(i). In\nher opening memorandum Ms. Maxwell noted that significant discovery related to the\nallegations had not yet been provided by the government, that her investigation is ongoing, and\nrequested that the Court defer ruling on this motion.\n\nThe government’s responses to Ms. Maxwell’s motions, including its response to this\nmotion, underscore the legitimacy of Ms. Maxwell’s continued request that the Court hold this\nissue open. As reflected in the various pleadings, the government did have communications with\nlawyers for civil litigants and did have information about the allegations made in the indictment\nwell before it claims the investigation was opened. Ms. Maxwell learned about these things only\nbecause the government felt the need to make partial disclosures in an atempt to defend its\nactions.\n\nIn its response to the instant motion, the government, without actually disclosing the\nwitness’s statements, selectively “proffers” “facts” to justify its position but tells Ms. Maxwell\nand the Court that we should, apparently, just trust the government because “the underlying\ninformation, which is contained in the FBI 3o2 reports of interviews with the victims, will be\nproduced to the defense as 35oo material in advance of trial.” Resp. at 55 fn. 2l.\n\nAs discussed in her Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Specificity, for a Bill of Particulars,\nand for Pretrial Disclosures, the government’s failure to provide adequate information about the\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003755.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o9 Filed o4/l6/2l Page3of5\nallegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s ability to investigate and\ndefend this mater. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information\nwhile at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when\nconvenient. This type of selective <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (l975); United States v.

Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely\nidentify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial\ndelay.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to\nDismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until\nafter the government has produced all of the discovery in this mater, including, but not limited\nto any alleged F.R.E. 4o4(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial.\n\nDated: March l5, 2o2l\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3755\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003781.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l2 Filed o4/l6/2l Page /7 of 2o\ninvestigation firm). “The governing rule in these circumstances is that the possessor of the\nclaimed privilege or right may intervene to assert it.” /d.

Since Maxwell never had notice of the subpoena to Boies Schiller,\nshe is doing here exactly what Lavender allous: filing a motion to suppress.\n\nTo be sure, if the government were right—that the mere fact of a third-party’s possession\nof property eliminates a defendant’s standing—then Carpenter v. United States would have\ncome out differently, since the defendant’s historical cell-site location information was in the\npossession of MetroPCS and Sprint. l38 S. Ct. 22o6, 22l2 (2ol8). But the United States\nSupreme Court rejected application of the third-party doctrine for two reasons, as this Court\nshould here.\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo378l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003800.jpg": "CasgdQo7G- Qi BF AAR NVaD GUM ALASD , HHRedeie/ BEI29 | PA AadERE of 8\nApp.-ol36\n\nIn deciding to stay the civil case, courts generally weigh six factors: (l) the extent to\nwhich the issues in the criminal case overlap with those in the civil case; (2) the status of the\ncriminal case, including whether the defendant has been indicted; (3) the private interests of the\nplaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the\ndelay; (4) the private interests of and burden on the defendant; (5) the interest of the Court; and\n(6) the public interest.

First, presumably the issues in any purported criminal\ninvestigation are identical with the underlying issue in this case: did Ms. Maxwell assist in\n“trafficking” the Plaintiff as she claims from l999 to 2ool. As to the second factor Plaintiff\nclaims to have information about this issue, although no indictment has been issued. Third,\ngiven the age of the underlying allegations, almost 2o years, there does not appear to be any\nprejudice that could be caused by any delay. Fourth, in the event there actually is an\ninvestigation and Plaintiff is involved in fomenting the investigation, Ms. Maxwell has a\nsignificant interest in knouing about the investigation so that she can appropriately respond and\nassess any claim of privilege. Concerning factor five, the Court has an interest in controlling the\nproceedings before it and also has an interest in protecting the rights of the litigants.

As the Second\nCircuit explained, “the privacy interests of innocent third parties as well as those of\ndefendants that may be harmed by <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> . . . should weigh heavily in a court's balancing\nequation in determining what portions of motion papers in question should remain sealed or\nshould be redacted.” Mater of New York Times, 828 F.2d llo, ll6 (2d Cir. l987) (emphasis\nsupplied).! In the context of considering whether to unseal wiretap evidence during a motion\nto suppress, the Second Circuit explained that “[p]roceedings may be closed and, by analogy,\ndocuments may be sealed if ‘specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating that\n‘closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’”\nId. at ll6 (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v.

Alison J. Nathan\nApril l5, 2o2l\nPage 2\nwith Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers to obtain information subject to strict protective orders in the civil\ncases. To carry out this plan, the government sought ex parte subpoenas from two judicial\nofficers—Chief Judge McMahon and Magistrate Judge Netburn—for Boies Schiller Flexner’s\nfiles in the civil cases.\n\nMagistrate Judge Netburn rejected the scheme.\n\nJudge McMahon proceeded with caution, concerned about possible collusion between\nthe government and the civil atorneys. She haled an Assisted United States Atorney into\ncourt and asked him a simple and direct question: What contacts had there been between the\ngovernment and the plaintiffs’ lawyers? The honest answer to the question would have\ndisclosed at least one lengthy meeting and numerous follou up communications between the\ngovernment and the lawyers, a <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> that would have led Judge McMahon to deny the ex\nparte subpoena request. But the government did not give an honest answer. The government\ninstead denied any contacts or communication between the U.S. Atorney’s Office and the\nplaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was no coordination\nbetween the government and counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,\nwhich resulted in the illegal circumvention of a valid protective order. Ms. Maxwell’s due\nprocess motion to suppress and the reply in support thereof set forth the relevant factual\nbackground. An evidentiary hearing on the motion will shed even further light, given the\nincredible nature of the government’s denials.\n\nIndeed, in response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to exclude evidence obtained in\nviolation of the protective order, the government made minimal inquiries about the scope of\nits misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. The government endeavored to minimize the\ndamage, not find out the truth. Professed lack of memory was not probed, global email\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3854\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003857.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2l8 Filed o4/l9/2l Page5of8\nThe Hon.

Accordingly, it is\nnot, as theorized by the government, “Giglio or 35oo” material. Leter, p. 5. Thus, there is no\n“cognizable interest” in “controlling the timing of disclosures,” id., because under the\ngovernment’s “willful blindness” policy there would be nothing to disclose.\n\nThe final “interest” advanced by the government is in “its oun communications.” For\nsupport, the government cites United States v. Carton, No. l7 CR 68o (CM), 2ol8 WL\n58l8lo7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l9, 2ol8). Leter, p. 5.

The government does not explain hou third-party\nsubpoenas would implicate “its oun communications,” which it fails to define. None of Ms.\nMaxwell’s subpoenas seek government work product or internal communications between\ngovernment employees, and the government has no legitimate interest in suppressing third-\nparty communications.!\n\nBut even if the government’s oun communications were at issue, the government has\nwaived any privilege it may have otherwise asserted. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to\nsuppress, the government voluntarily disclosed and atached several internal emails between\nits atorneys.

All the subpoenas requested by\nMs. Maxwell are under the strict procedures authorized by the Rule. The Court is keenly\naware of the standards necessary for the issuance of a Rule l7 subpoena and needs no\nassistance from the government in performing this gatekeeping function. Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel understand the scope and limitations of Rule l7 and have not requested anything that\nwould run afoul of the Rule. The subpoena recipients are third parties who are well qualified\nto assert any objection to the subpoena requests.\n\nA similar request was made, and rejected in Ray, supra, at *7:\n\nthe Government is not entitled to be informed of the complete universe of\n\nsubpoenas requested by the defense that may relate to other victims, nou or\n\ngoing forward. In its leters and at argument, the Government urged that it had\n\nan independent obligation to protect the rights of victims and that it was best\n\nsituated to inform the Court of the relevance or lack of relevance of any\n\nsubpoena related to victim records. That obligation to protect the rights of\n\nvictims, houever, also is shared by the Court, and the Court is fully capable of\n\ndirecting the Government be informed of a subpoena and requesting the\n\nappropriate information in an appropriate case and regardless whether the\n\nvictim objects.\n\nIV. The Government is Not Entitled to Advance Notice of Material Produced\n\nThe government offers no authority for its request that it receive contemporaneous\ncopies of any material produced pursuant to a Rule l7 subpoena.

Given that the largest\nportion of the discovery in this case is text searchable, the defense will also be able to tailor any\nre-review of those materials through relevant search terms. The combination of having already\npossessed the relevant discovery for months and receiving a list of key documents should\nmeaningfully assist the defense in preparing for trial as scheduled.\n\nThe Government has also commited to providing further disclosures well in advance of\ntrial and far earlier than such productions would ordinarily be made in this District. The\nGovernment has already begun producing materials relating to witnesses whom it does not intend\nto call at trial to the defense, more than three months in advance of trial. The bulk of those\nmaterials were produced on April l3, 2o2l, and the Government intends to make additional\nproductions on a rolling basis as it continues to review its files for such materials. In this vein, the\nGovernment has produced materials, including prior witness statements, for approximately 225\nindividuals relevant to the Government’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant, and\nothers. While the Government made this production with an expansive eye touard its pretrial\ndisclosures, as it has adopted throughout the pendency of this mater, it bears noting that a\nsignificant majority of those individuals never mentioned or knew the defendant. Indeed, the\nnumber of non-testifying witnesses who mentioned the defendant makes up a small portion of the\noverall production. That is unsurprising, given that the Government conducted a broad\ninvestigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, including crimes that did not involve this defendant.\nAccordingly, to the extent the defense claims it nou needs to investigate or interview all, or even\nthe majority of these witnesses, it is unclear hou that testimony would be relevant or admissible\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3948\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page8oflo\nPage 8\nthat its investigation of the witnesses referenced in these materials will take months, it fails to\nexplain in any detail what specific steps it needs to take, why those steps are material to preparing\na defense, or hou those steps would be particularly expected to lead to admissible evidence at trial.\n\nAdditionally, the Government has agreed to provide the defense with expert notice by April\n23, 2o2l and the names of the victims referenced in the S2 Indictment by May l7, 2o2l. The\nGovernment has also agreed to provide notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b), a\nproposed witness list, Jencks Act material, and Giglio material 45 days in advance of trial. As a\nresult, the defense will receive many of these disclosures weeks in advance of when is typical for\ncriminal defendants in this District, thereby further ensuring ample time to prepare for trial. To\nthe extent the defense claims that it will need to retain additional experts to review electronic\nevidence, it appears that would be true regardless of the S2 Indictment because the electronic\ndiscovery materials referenced in the defense’s most recent leter were already part of the discovery\nin this case before the S2 Indictment was returned. In any event, the defense will receive the\nGovernment’s expert <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> tomorrou, thereby providing more than two months for the\ndefense to consider whether it wishes to offer any responsive expert(s). Further, the defense’s\nsuggestion that it has insufficient time to file additional motions is undercut by the proposed\nschedule agreed upon by the parties, which allous the defense to file its supplemental pretrial\nmotions more than five weeks after the return of the S2 Indictment and its motions in /imine more\nthan eight weeks from today and eleven weeks from the return of the S2 Indictment.\n\nAlthough the defense claims that its trial preparation will be hampered by the COVID-l9\npandemic, the availability of vaccines to all adults in the United States should enable the defense\nteam to conduct any necessary investigation far more expeditiously than was possible a few\nmonths ago. Further, the defense’s concerns that jury selection will be lengthy or cumbersome in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 235 Filed o4/22/2l Page9oflo\nPage 9\n\nthis case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,\nyet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more\nimportantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time\nrequired for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a\njury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defense’s complaint that it is\ndifficult to estimate the length of a defense case before <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Jencks Act material and\nGovernment exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.\n\nThe defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,\nall of whom are experienced and skilled trial atorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the\ndefense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping\nschedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the\ndefendant has the benefit of even more atorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and\nargue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and\ninvestigators assisting her atorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is\nevery reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional\nrepresentation at trial as scheduled.\n\nThird, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The\nlonger this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial\ntestimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any\nadjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress\nduring the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through\ntrial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an\nenormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo395l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003955.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page l of 6\nia U.S. Department of Justice\nNaF 4 United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the Court’s Order dated\nApril l6, 2o2l, which directed the Government to confirm that it has complied with its discovery\nobligations with respect to the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). (Dkt. No. 2o7).\nA. Overview\nThe Government takes its discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations seriously, and it has\nendeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the\npendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its discovery and\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks\nAct obligations with respect to the materials already in the possession of the prosecution team, but\nthat it also makes reasonable efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the\nfiles of other investigative agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was\nformulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Atorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\nalso noting what the Government has not done and does not believe it is obligated to do with\nrespect to materials that are potentially related to the NPA.\nB. The Prosecution Team’s Files\n\nAs the Court is aware, the charges in this case arose from an investigation opened in 2ol8\nand conducted by the United States Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York\n(“SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York\nPolice Department (“NYPD”; collectively, the “Prosecution Team”). (Dkt. No. 63 at l). The\nGovernment has obtained the full investigative file from the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident Agency\n(the “FBI Florida Office”), which conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey\nEpstein between 2oo5 and 2olo (the “FBI Florida File”), and whose file also contained the\ninvestigative file for the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) related to that same\ninvestigation (the “Florida Investigation”). The Government has reviewed and produced all Rule\nl6 materials, including potential Brady material, contained within the Prosecution Team’s Files,\nincluding the FBI Florida File and the PBPD file. The Government has not identified anything\nwithin the files of the Prosecution Team, the FBI Florida File, or the PBPD file that constitutes\nBrady material with respect to the NPA.\n\nC. The Government’s Collection and Review of Other Agencies’ Files\n\nOn October 7, 2o2o, the Government submited a leter to the Court seting forth its plan\nfor collecting and reviewing certain files from other agencies with potential relevance to this case.\n(Dkt. No. 63). Although Second Circuit law did not require the Government to do so because\nthose other agencies were not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government endeavored to collect\nand review certain of those materials as part of its commitment to go above and beyond its\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations. (/d. at 4). In particular, the Government noted its intention to collect: (l)\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\n\nthe FBI Florida File and the PBPD file, from which the Government has made Rule l6 productions,\nand which the Government is continuing to review for Giglio and Jencks Act material, (ll) the\nPalm Beach State Atorney’s office file, from which the Government has made Rule l6\nproductions, and which the Government is continuing to review for Giglio and Jencks Act material;\n(i) the file from the SDFL, discussed further belou; (iv) the inbox for the primary line Assistant\nU.S. Atorney at SDFL responsible for that office’s investigation of Jeffrey Epstein between 2oo5\nand 2olo (“Atorney-l”) that was previously gathered by OPR, discussed further belou; and (v)\ncertain potentially relevant materials, to the extent they existed, from a United States Atorney’s\nOffice in Georgia, which consist of a small amount of witness statements.\n\nWith respect to the SDFL file, based on an initial review,' the Government has not\nidentified any materials that would be subject to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under Rule l6. This is unsurprising\nbecause discoverable materials such as subpoena returns and search warrant materials appear to\nhave been maintained in the FBI Florida Office’s file. Although the Government did identify\nmaterials that are broadly related to the NPA, the Government has not identified any items that\nwould constitute Brady material. The Government is continuing to review the SDFL file for Giglio\nand Jencks Act material. And of course, to the extent the Government identifies potential Brady\nmaterial or material discoverable under Rule l6 that is not duplicative of prior productions, it will\npromptly produce it.\n\n' In the fall of 2o2o, SDFL agreed to provide SDNY with a copy of all of its files relating to Jeffrey\nEpstein so that SDNY could review those files for disclosures. Those files consist of 28 boxes,\nwhich contain material relating both to the investigation of Epstein and a civil lawsuit filed by\nvictims challenging the NPA under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. The Government hired a\nvendor to scan the files in these boxes, but technical difficulties with that vendor prevented those\nscans from being loaded into a document review platform until several weeks ago. Before those\nscans were loaded into the document review platform, the Government conducted an initial review\nof the scans in their native form.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 239 Filed o4/23/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nWith respect to Atorney-l’s inbox, the Government previewed in its October 7, 2o2o leter\nthat it planned to review the inbox—which is voluminous’—using search terms to identify witness\nstatements and Giglio material. Those search terms did not include search terms relevant to the\nNPA, and the Government has not searched Atorney-l’s inbox for communications relating to the\nNPA. Instead, because the Government obtained these materials with an eye touards identifying\nany additional witness statements or Giglio material that might not otherwise be contained in the\nFBI Florida File, the Government ran search terms specific to this case, focusing on the names of\nvictims, Government witnesses, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government’s review of the emails\nresponsive to its search terms remains ongoing, and the Government will produce any non-\nduplicative documents that warrant <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. The Government expects this to be a limited set of\ndocuments that will be produced along with other Jencks Act and Giglio material. Of course,\nshould the Government identify any exculpatory material during this review, including with\nrespect to the NPA, it will promptly produce such material.\n\nAs the foregoing illustrates, the Government has taken an expansive approach to discovery\nand is close to completing its review of files from other agencies for Jencks Act and Giglio\nmaterial. Thus far, the Government has not identified potential Brady material with respect to the\nNPA during its review. To the extent the Government identifies potential Brady material with\nrespect to the NPA, that is, material that supports Maxwell’s reading of the NPA as discussed\nabove, or any other exculpatory material, the Government will promptly produce it. Houever,\n> More specifically, it appears that OPR obtained an entire snapshot of Atorney-l’s inbox,\nspanning several years, and encompassing all of Atorney-l’s emails during that time period. In\nother words, the inbox is not specific to the Epstein investigation, and it contains a high volume of\ncommunications relating to other cases and other internal SDFL maters. The snapshot provided\nby OPR contains emails and their atachments, both inbound and outbound, totaling more than\n3oo,ooo documents.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3959\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 244 _ Filed o4/23/2l Page5ofl4\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Second, because the material is\nnot in the possession of the government it is not a “statement” falling within Rule l7(h).\n\n‘“‘Witness Statements” covered by Rule l7 are defined by Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(f):\n\n(l) a writen statement that the witness makes and signs, or otherwise adopts or\n\napproves;\n\n(2) a substantially verbatim, contemporaneously recorded recital of the witness's\n\noral statement that is contained in any recording or any transcription of a recording;\n\nor\n\n(3) the witness's statement to a grand jury, houever taken or recorded, or a\n\ntranscription of such a statement.\nThe “statements” are those of a testifying witness in the possession of the party who did not “call\nthe witness,” produced upon request after the witness testifies at a qualifying event, such as a\npretrial hearing or trial.\n\nMaterials held by entities other than the United States generally fall outside the Jencks\nAct and are therefore not “witness statements.” United States v. Bermudez, 526 F.2d 89, loo n.9\n(2d Cir. l975) (no violation of the Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(b), which requires the United\nStates to turn over to defendants the statements of a witness which are “in the possession of the\nUnited States”); see also United States v.

Nathan\nApril 2, 2o2l\nPage l3\nonly recourse is to seek production from BSF which admitedly has the material in its possession.\nOtherwise, once the witness testifies and a request is made for the material the government will\nsimply profess blessed ignorance.\n\nContrary to BSF’s assertion, the EVCP is not “mere” impeachment material; it is Brady\nmaterial that the government would be required to turn over if in their possession. The\ngovernment knous that it “is under no obligation to turn over that which it does not have,”\nUnited States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 727, 746 (E.D.N.Y. l994), which is why it refuses to obtain\nthe material. Once again, Ms. Maxwell needs the Court’s assistance.\n\nInformation is “exculpatory and thus ‘favorable’ to the defense for Brady purposes when\nit directly contradicts the motive theory testified to by prosecution witnesses. Mendez v. Artuz,\n3o3 F.3d 4ll, 4l4 (2d Cir. 2oo2). For the reasons articulated in Ms. Maxwell’s ex parte\nsubmission, the EVCP Materials directly contradict the “motive theory” that will be advanced by\nthe prosecution at trial — that Ms. Maxwell was the procurer of underaged women for Epstein.\n\nIn addition, even if the materials were deemed “impeachment only” they would remain\ndiscoverable by a subpoena as exculpatory evidence. Where, as here, the government’s proof\ndepends almost entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of the accusers, “impeachment”\nevidence is material and discoverable in advance of trial. As discussed in Poventud v. City of\nNew York, No. o7 CIV. 3998 DAB, 2ol5 WL lo62l86, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2ol5),\n\n[I]mpeachment evidence constitutes exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed.\n\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of impeachment evidence, where “the [g]overnment's case depended\n\nalmost entirely on [the victim's] testimony,” Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o,\n\nl54-55 (l972), goes to the heart of Brady and Giglio. See Napue v.

Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 23l, 234 (l985) (no prejudice to\nsuperseding indictment which changed the date of offense by ten days); United States v. Stringer,\n73o F.3d l2o, l28 (2d Cir. 2ol3) (not an abuse of discretion to deny continuance for a\nsuperseding indictment that extended the conspiracy range by one month).\n\nIn this case, the changes to the indictment were anything but minimal. The conspiracy\nwas expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven\nyears (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.\nThese were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance. The need to research\nMs. Maxwell’s whereabouts during a full eleven year period, not to mention comb the millions\nof pages of discovery including travel records, phone records, bank records, photographs, diaries,\nmessage pads, credit card records, and countless other records for the eleven-year versus four\nyear period, will take hundreds, if not thousands, of atorney and staff hours.\n\nC. The new, and old, discovery require review (and re-review) and analysis.\n\nThe government, on April l3, 2o2l, produced more than 2o,ooo pages of “new”\ndiscovery. Although the government represented that this production is related to “non-testifying\nwitnesses,” it is more accurately described as exculpatory Brady material. Notably, the\ngovernment has possessed most of this information for years (in some cases, more than a decade)\nand has resisted <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> until after the filing of the second superseding indictment and on the\neve of trial.2, Many of the reports recently produced stem from the years 2oo6-2oo8.\n\n? Consistent with the updated Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(f) and the Due Process Protections Act, Pub. L.\nNo ll6-l82, l34 Stat. 894 (Oct. 2l, 2o2o), this Court on November 5, 2o2o, ordered that “The\nGovernment shall disclose [Brady] information to the defense promptly after its existence\nbecomes knoun to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information\nin the preparation of its case. See Dkt. 68 (emphasis supplied).

And, again, the images\ncontain metadata that defense counsel must forensically analyze. Because defense counsel do not\neven have all of the images, this investigation cannot be accomplished in advance of the July l2,\n2o2l trial.\n\nF. The new charges and discovery require the assistance of defense experts\n\nIn addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of\npotential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized\nknouledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is nou potentially relevant due to the\nexpanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential\nhard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual\nfile creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government\nhas not identified any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic\nexaminers may be necessary to analyze the exhibits.\n\nMs. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 2o,ooo pages of “new” material to\nprovide that information to potential defense experts for consideration. None of this can happen\nin time to make appropriate disclosures in advance of trial. See United States v. Santos, No. S 9l\nCR. 724 (CSH), l99l WL 248784 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, l99l) (granting a continuance for\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3998\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003999.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 246 Filed o4/23/2l Pagel2ofl3\nThe Hon.

Motions\n\nMs. Maxwell anticipates that the Court will need to resolve various discovery disputes\nrelating to the problems identified supra. In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to\nsupplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P l2 motions relating to\nthe second superseding indictment. After reviewing the “new” discovery, Ms. Maxwell\nanticipates that she will file motions in limine related to the government’s alleged FRE 4o4(b)\nevidence and the government’s proposed exhibits, FRE 7o2 challenges to purported expert\ntestimony, and motions concerning jury selection and change of venue. In addition, expert\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may necessitate a Daubert hearing.\n\nBecause Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”\ndiscovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely\nwhat additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along\nwith the late <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Brady material and failure to provide the discovery to Ms. Maxwell\nhave delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that\nwould normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings. Simply stated, Ms. Maxwell’s\ncounsel cannot perform all of the necessary tasks in the time remaining before July l2, 2o2l.\n\nII. Requested Relief\nIn United States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 23l (l985), Justice Blackmun, in a\nconcurring opinion joined by Justice Brennan, recognized the need for a continuance when a\nsuperseding indictment adds significant changes.\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3999\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004008.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page8ofl7\n\nThe Honorable Alison J.

In Requests 3 through 5, the Defendant seeks all\ncommunications between BSF and its co-counsel in a civil litigation against Maxwell (Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5-cv-o7433-LAP) “between 2ol5 and the date of this subpoena about any meeting with\nthe United States Atorney concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or gg.” Certainly, some\nof these communications, if they exist, may fall under the work product umbrella if they were\ninternal discussions with co-counsel. Moreover, BSF and its co-counsel have a common interest\nprotection in their communications. The Defendant’s overbroad Requests make it impossible for\nBSF to determine hou many responsive communications would be protected and why. Again, it\nis the Defendant’s burden to demonstrate that all of the communications she seeks would be\nrelevant and admissible, and it is not BSF’s burden to review broad swaths of material to determine\nwhat the Defendant is entitled to under Rule l7.\n\nCi Communications Between BSF and the Government Are Procurable from the\n\nGovernment.\n\nEven if Requests l through 5 could overcome Nixon’s three hurdles, houever, Requests l\nand 2 would still fail to the extent that they ask for communications with the Government, which\nthe Defendant can procure from the Government. The Defendant admits that the Government has\nthe communications she is seeking, but complains that the Government “has failed to produce, or\neven look for these communications and Ms. Maxwell has no other means to obtain them.” Resp.\nLtr. at 8. In fact, this dispute is currently pending before the Court—the Defendant filed a Motion\nfor a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures in which she seeks an order compelling the\nGovernment to disclose the very communications with BSF she seeks in the Subpoena and to\nimmediately disclose all Brady and Giglio materials. ECF Nos. l48, l48-5 (motion requesting\ndocuments relating to the Defendant’s two motions to suppress evidence obtained from what\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oo8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004009.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 Filed o4/23/2l Page9ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

See, e.g., Nixon, 4l8\nU.S. at 699 (documents requested pursuant to Rule l7(c) must not be “otherwise procurable” from\nanother source); United States v. Cole, No. l9 CR. 869 (ER), 2o2l WL 9l2425, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.\nMar. lo, 2o2l) (explaining that “Rule l7(c) is not the proper method for obtaining” materials that\nthe Government has an obligation to disclose under the Jencks Act, Brady, and Giglio). If the\nDefendant is not entitled to obtain the communications she seeks from the Government under Rule\nl6, then they are not discoverable under Rule l7 from a nonparty. See United States v. Boyle, No.\no8 Cr. 523 (CM), 2oo9 WL 484436, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2oo9) (“Defendants may not seek\nmaterial under Rule l7 that they are prohibited from obtaining under Rule l6.”); United States v.\nBarnes, No. S89 o4 CR l86 SCR, 2oo8 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

R. Crim. P. l6.”). Either way, if the\nGovernment has the communications that the Defendant seeks and if she is legally entitled to them,\nshe must get them from the Government.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4oo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004012.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 247 _ Filed o4/23/2l Pagel2ofl7\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Rather, the Defendant seeks the entire journal so that she can fish for other passages\nthat she can use to atempt to impeach Ms. Farmer’s credibility. Such a fishing expedition for\npotential impeachment material goes beyond the permissible bounds of a Rule l7 subpoena. See\nNixon, 4l8 U.S. at 7ol (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to\nrequire its production in advance of trial.”). And if the Defendant does not seek the remainder of\nthe journal passages for impeachment, she does not explain hou they would otherwise be relevant\nand admissible at trial. The Court should not require production of the entire journal—which\ncontains personal, private information about Ms. Farmer when she was a minor—if Defendant is\nunable to demonstrate that the overbroad Request meets the relevance and admissibility\nrequirements and if it will yield no material evidence.°®\n6 Even in civil cases, where much broader discovery is permited under the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure than under Rule l7(c), courts have refused to order <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of an entire diary\nor journal when the journal contains personal or sensitive entries and the party seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\ncannot demonstrate that anything relevant has been withheld.

Rule 26.2 Does Not Mandate Advance <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Statements of Prospective\n\nDefense Witnesses.\n\nRule 26.2(a) provides:\n\nAfter a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination, the\n\ncourt, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order an atorney\n\nfor the government or the defendant and the defendant’s atorney to produce, for\n\nthe examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is\n\nin their possession and that relates to the subject mater of the witness’s\n\ntestimony.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a). The requirements of Rule 26.2 “essentially track those of the Jencks\nAct.” United States v. Scoti, 47 F.3d l237, l249 (2d Cir. l995). The Rule provides that the\ndefense, like the prosecution, must produce witness statements. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\"Ms. Maxwell understands that the Court has ordered that “The Defendant’s Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) disclosures and witness list are due three weeks before the trial\ncommencement date.” See Dkt. No. 25o. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A) applies to documents and\nobjects that the defendant intends to use in the defendant’s case-in-chief at trial. Fed. R. Crim. P.\nl6(b)(l)(B) applies to reports of examinations or tests and witnesses who prepared any report or\nexamination if the defense intends to call the witness at trial during the defendant’s case-in-chief.\nAt this stage of the proceeding Ms. Maxwell continues to review the evidence and witness\nmaterials recently provided by the government and has not identified any documents, tests, or\nwitnesses that would fall into these categories.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004086.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page 3of7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 3\n26.2(f) Advisory Commitee’s Note, l979 Addition. Houever, like the Jencks Act, the Rule\nrequires <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness statements only after a witness has testified on direct examination.\nFed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a); see also Scoti, 47 F.3d at l25o (“The plain language of\nboth Rule 26.2 and l8 U.S.C. § 35oo(a) shous that the discovery procedure therein outlined\napplies only to statements that must be produced after a witness testifies[.]”) (internal quotation\nomited)); United States v. Felt, 5o2 F. Supp. 7l, 74 (D.D.C. l98o) (“access is to be permited\nafter the defense witness has testified on direct examination”). A district court therefore lacks\nauthority to order early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> statements of prospective defense witnesses.\n\nDue to their similarities, federal courts look to decisions interpreting l8 U.S.C. § 35oo in\norder to interpret Rule 26.2. The Second Circuit has long maintained that “the Jencks Act\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness statements.” United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool). See also In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987); United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32 (2d Cir. l974) (‘the trial judge is\nprevented by the Jencks Act from ordering pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of statements made by a\nprospective government witness over the government’s objection”). Cf United States v. Benson,\n2o F.R.D. 6o2, 6o5 (S.D.N.Y. l957) (holding that Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (l953)\ndoes not apply until “a witness is called to the witness stand”).\n\nBecause the court cannot compel the government to provide early Jencks Act or Rule\n26.2 disclosures to the defense — and the defense is not entitled to it by virtue of statute — it\nnecessarily follous that the court cannot compel the same material from the defense. See\nWardius v. Oregon, 4l2 U.S. 47o, 475-76 (l973). A district court can only “encourage” the\npractice of early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. See Percevault, 49o F.2d at l32.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004087.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page4of/7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 4\nI. The Defense Does Not — and Need Not - Yet Intend to Call Any Particular Witness.\n\nUnlike Rule l6(b)(l), the Jencks Act and Rule 26.2 do not obligate the defense to\nreciprocate the government’s early disclosures with early disclosures of its oun. If the\ngovernment discloses Jencks Act material early, the defense is not obligated to act in kind. See\nUnited States v. Martin, No. CR o7-l2o5 (A) CBM, 2oo9 WL 453l95, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 2o,\n2oo9) (denying government’s motion to compel reciprocal Jencks Act discovery from defense).\nThere is good reason for not mandating such reciprocity: the government and the defendant are\nnot similarly situated.\n\nMs. Maxwell has the right to a presumption of innocence. Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S.\n5ol, 5o3 (l976). The burden to prove guilt is high, and it is entirely the government’s to bear.\n“T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.” Jn re\nWinship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (l97o). In result, the defense is not obligated in any way to put on\nevidence at trial, including witnesses. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell has rights to a present a\ndefense and to compulsory process of witnesses. U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Washington v. Texas,\n388 U.S. l4, l8 (l967).\n\nBecause all defense witnesses are prospective, defense considerations regarding trial\nstrategy with respect to these decisions are protected by atorney-client privilege and the work\nproduct doctrine. “Although the work-product doctrine most frequently is asserted as a bar to\ndiscovery in civil litigation, its role in assuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice\nsystem is even more vital.” United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 238 (l975). See also\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (l984) (“Government violates the right to effective\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004088.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 Filed o5/o3/2l Page5of7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 5\nassistance when it interferes in certain ways with the ability of counsel to make independent\ndecisions about hou to conduct the defense.”’).\n\nIf the court were to act outside its statutory authority and compel defense counsel to\ndisclose defense material prematurely, then Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights\nwould be endangered. While the aims of judicial economy and efficiency may be served by\nordering the defense to disclose prospective witnesses, such policy goals, houever laudable,\ncannot trump fundamental liberties. “In the administration of criminal justice, courts must\ncarefully guard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative\nevidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.” Estelle, 425 U.S. at 5o3.\n\nII. Procedural Rules Aside, the Government Must Timely Disclose Any Brady and\n\nGiglio Material.\n\nBrady and its progeny impose upon the government broad duties of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. See Brady\nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (l963) (“the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable\nto an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or\nto punishment”); United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (l985) (defining materiality);\nStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 28l-82 (l999) (same); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o,\nl54 (l972) (government has duty to disclose material affecting reliability of government\nwitnesses).\n\nThe court’s authority, or lack thereof, to order disclosures under Rules l6 and 26.2 does\nnot affect the defendant’s right to Brady material. “It is, of course, a fundamental axiom of\nAmerican law, rooted in our history as a people and requiring no citations to authority, that the\nrequirements of the Constitution prevail over a statute in the event of a conflict.” Coppa, 267\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004089.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 267 _ Filed o5/o3/2l Page 6of7\nThe Hon. Alison J. Nathan\nMay 3, 2o2l\nPage 6\nF.3d at l45—46. Nor do the procedural and statutory rules affect the defense’s right to Brady\ninformation prior to trial. See Docket No. 68 (“The Government shall disclose [Brady]\ninformation to the defense promptly after its existence becomes knoun to the Government so\nthat the defense may make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case.”);\naccord Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(f); United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir. 2oo7) (“the\nGovernment must make disclosures in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable\nopportunity to act upon the information efficaciously”).\n\nIn sum, Ms. Maxwell will be able to identify any relevant defense witnesses and exhibits\nthat she may need to introduce in a defense case only after the government concludes the\npresentation of its evidence at trial. Evidence may, or may not, be necessary after the government\nconcludes its case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell’s proposal is reasonable and will avoid any\nunnecessary trial delays because it is unlikely that any Rule 26.2 statements not already in the\npossession of the government, if they exist, will be voluminous or complicated.\n\nGovernment’s Position\n\nConsistent with the position set forth in its April 2l, 2o2l leter to the Court, the\nGovernment proposes that defense counsel provide a proposed witness list and witness\nstatements pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.l four weeks in advance of trial.\nSuch a production schedule would be consistent with the Government's agreement to provide\nJencks Act material seven weeks in advance of trial, which is significantly before the\nGovernment is obligated to produce such material under the relevant statute. Production in\nadvance of trial will also ensure adequate time for the Government to file any relevant motions\nand to prepare any rebutal case as appropriate.

See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at lo9 (explaining\nthat Rule l7(c) is not appropriate for evidence that is “otherwise procurable” (internal quotation\nmarks omited)). BSF represents that “all potentially relevant pages were produced from this\njournal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another mater.” (3/22/2l Leter from BSF, Dkt. No.\nl9l at 5). The Government also obtained and produced seven pages of the diary to the defendant\nin discovery. (Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. l48 at lo).\n\nThe defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference\nto her. (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2\nhave acknouledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2\nis expected to testify to that fact at trial. (See Gov’t Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87 (citing\nMem. in Opp. to Def.’s Renewed Motion for Release, Dkt. No. loo at ll n.2.); 3/22/2l Leter from\nBSF, Dkt. No. l9l at 5). The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and\nproduce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 2o7 at 29).\nAs the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that\nMinor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no\nentries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t\nOmnibus Response, Dkt. No. 2o4 at l87). The victim provided the Government with her entries\nrelating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.). The remainder\nof the diary consists of Minor Victim-2’s unrelated personal diary entries, and the defendant has\nnot explained and cannot explain why she needs to review those entries to establish a fact that the\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4o96\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004098.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 269 Filed o5/o4/2l Page5of9\nPage 5\n\n(N.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, l989) (reaching the unremarkable result that an “undercover agent’s diary” is\n“not discoverable in and of itself” except “to the extent that this diary contains” Brady material).\n\nAlternatively, the defendant states that she needs to inspect the “entire journal” to\n“establish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoilation has\noccurred.” (4/2/2l Leter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). “This examination,” she continues,\n“requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner.” (/d.) This argument lacks\nmerit. The defendant’s bare assertion that authenticity might somehou be in doubt is hardly a\nsufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor\nvictim’s personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity\nof the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly\nauthenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use,\nwhat kind of examination will occur, or hou that examination might bear on the journal’s\nauthenticity. See Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253 (explaining that the “items sought cannot merely be\npotentially relevant or admissible. Rather, they must be shoun to be relevant and admissible at\nthe time the subpoena is sought.” (internal quotation marks omited)); see also United States v.\nSkelos, No. l5-CR-3l7 (KMW), 2ol8 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

The government’s opposition\n(“Opp.”) does not address these justifications, or atempts to deflect them, and does nothing to\nundercut Ms. Maxwell’s arguments in support of the requested relief.\n\nIndeed, the new revelations in the government’s opposition highlight the need for the\nrelief she seeks. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion to Strike Surplusage from the Indictment,\nthe government’s opposition discloses for the first time that Accuser-3' will testify that she\nalleged y\neee\nES l:5: :tcz2:ions, which\nmeaningfully expand the scope of the charges against Ms. Maxwell, are not mentioned anywhere\nin the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”), nor are they alluded to in the over 2.7 million\npages of discovery. Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly investigate the allegations to prepare her\ndefense if she does not knou fundamental information about when and where the alleged\nincidents of sexual abuse took place. Nor can she make appropriate motions to preclude the\ngovernment’s use of this evidence, as it falls outside of the scope of the charged conspiracies.\nMoreover, the government continues to refuse to provide Ms. Maxwell the most basic piece of\ninformation she needs to prepare for trial — the names of the three individuals who have accused\n\" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in\nthe Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-l” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-l and\nAccuser-2, respectively.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo423l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004232.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page5ofl6\nher of the crimes charged in the Indictment. A bill of particulars is therefore necessary to\nprevent unfair surprise at trial and to allou Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nIt is also critical that Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the government’s\nwitness list, Jencks Act material, Brady/Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence, and any co-\nconspirator statements. The government predictably argues that there is nothing unusual about\nthe circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a deviation from customary\nproduction deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s case is not a typical case\nand presents unique circumstances that warrant the relief she seeks. The Indictment alleges\nvague conduct that is over 25 years old and involves conduct that allegedly took place over a\nfour-year period in multiple locations across the country and in at least one foreign jurisdiction.\nAny relevant documents that may still exist will take time to retrieve. The investigation of\nwitness statements and any Rule 4o4(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and\npotentially also involve foreign travel and depositions under Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. For these reasons, and the others set forth belou, the Court should order the\nproduction of these materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nMs. Maxwell has also provided specific reasons supporting her requests for the\nproduction and inspection of certain FBI reports and other documents, such as a complete copy\nof the handwriten diary, which are not included in the discovery. There is ample evidence to\nconclude that these documents contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key\ngovernment witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court\nshould therefore order the government to produce them.\n\n° Ms. Maxwell originally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March l2, 2o2l\n(Dkt. l48 at l5, l7), the same deadline as the Court imposed on the government to produce documents related to\ncertain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73). Because the Court granted Ms. Maxwell’s request to extend the filing\ndeadline for the reply motions by lo days from March 5, 2o2l to March l5, 2o2l, we have moved forward our\nrequested deadline for the production of witness materials by lo days to March 22, 2o2l.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4232\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004234.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page 7 of l6\ncompel pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of government witnesses. See United States v.\nCannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3ol (2d Cir. l975).\n\nSecond, as discussed in Ms. Maxwell’s opening memorandum, the allegations in the\nIndictment and the extremely limited information contained in the discovery are insufficient to\nadvise Ms. Maxwell of the nature and scope of the charges against her. The government’s\nopposition provides a perfect illustration of Ms. Maxwell’s point: it discloses entirely new\nallegations of a involving Accuser-3, which it will seek to introduce at\ntrial, but which are not contained in the Indictment and are not alluded to, or corroborated,\nanywhere in the over 2.7 million pages of discovery.\n\nAs aresult of Ms. Maxwell’s Motion to Strike Surplusage (“Surplusage Motion”), the\ngovernment has apparently recognized that the allegations in the Indictment concerning Accuser-\n3 do not constitute direct evidence of the charged conspiracies because: (i) Accuser-3 was above\nthe age of consent in the United Kingdom when the alleged episodes of sexual activity with\nEpstein took place, and were therefore not illegal, and (i) there is no allegation that Accuser-3\never traveled. In an atempt to cure these deficiencies, the government nou discloses for the first\ntime in its opposition that Accuser-3 will testify that {| i“ wCrrrr——CisYS\nBE opp. l59). Accuser-3 wit! also testify:\neS\n* As discussed more fully in Ms. Maxwell’s Reply Memorandum in Support of Her Motion to Strike Surplusage\nfrom the Indictment (“Surplusage Reply”), these new allegations are also not direct evidence of the charged\nconspiracies and should not be offered as such at trial.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4234\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004235.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page8ofl6\nThese new allegations—which expand the nature and scope of the charged\nconspiracies—are exactly the type of “surprise” revelations that a bill of particulars is designed\nto protect against. The Indictment makes no mention of these allegations, nor is there any\ninformation in the discovery indicating that they would be part of the government’s case. The\ngovernment therefore cannot argue, as it does in its opposition, that the information provided in\nthe Indictment and the discovery produced to date are sufficient for Ms. Maxwell to understand\nthe nature of the charges against her, especially when only a small fraction of the discovery\npertains to the time period charged in the Indictment. (Opp. l79-8l). “The Government [does]\nnot fulfill its obligation merely by providing mountains of documents to defense counsel” if the\ndiscovery does not identify the alleged criminal conduct.” Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575; see also\nUnited States v. Luna, No. 3:o5-CR-58 (SRU), 2oo6 WL l668oo6, at *2 (D. Conn. May l7,\n2oo6) (“[W ]hen faced with ‘mountains’ of discovery or ‘massive disclosures,’ a defendant may\nstill be unable to prepare for trial and prevent surprise.”).\nNor can the government take shelter in the fact that it has nou disclosed these allegations.\nThe government only made this <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> because of Ms. Maxwell’s Surplusage Motion. Had\nshe not made that motion, Ms. Maxwell would not have knoun about these allegations until she\nreceived Jencks Act disclosures a few weeks before trial, which would not have given her\nsufficient time to investigate 25-year-old allegations of SS Sa\na\nalso raises the question of whether Accuser-l and Accuser-2 have alleged | ~—sdY\nLo that are not included in the Indictment, but which the government plans to introduce\nat trial.

See Bortnovsky, 82o F.2d at 575 (bill of particulars necessary to\nprevent the government from proceeding “furtively’”).\n\nMoreover, as discussed more fully in the Surplusage Reply, these new allegations\nrepresent an impermissible atempt by the government to broaden the scope of the alleged\nconspiracies and bolster its thin case with testimony that is irrelevant to the charged crimes.\nAccordingly, a bill of particulars is not only necessary so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately\nprepare her defense, but also so that the government cannot use evidence that is outside the scope\nof the charged conspiracies to prove its case. See United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d l4, 33\n(D.D.C. l998) (ordering a bill of particulars “as to the scope of the alleged conspiratorial\nagreement” and whether and hou certain allegations “were within the scope of the conspiracy\ncharged”).4\nI. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of the\n\nGovernment’s Witness List, Jencks Act Material, Brady/Giglio Material, Rule\n\n4o4(b) Material, and Co-Conspirator Statements.\n\nAs set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, her case presents special circumstances and\nunique investigative challenges that justify accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses, their prior statements and impeachment material, any expected Rule\n4o4(b) evidence, and any potential co-conspirator statements. (Dkt. l48 at l4-l5). In response,\nthe government does not atempt to rebut Ms. Maxwell’s justifications for accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof these materials. Instead, it offers a formulaic argument that Ms. Maxwell’s case is no\ndifferent than other recent high-profile trials in this District, that she has not made a sufficient\n“It is telling that these new allegations are surfacing for the first time in the government’s opposition. Either the\ngovernment just learned this information from Accuser-3 or it was already aware of this information, but decided\nnot to present it to the grand jury — perhaps because there is nothing whatsoever in the discovery that corroborates\nthese statements.\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004237.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page lo of l6\nshouing of need, and that comparable and customary <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> deadlines for these materials are\nappropriate. (Opp. l84-85, l88-93). But Ms. Maxwell’s case is different—emphatically so—\nand the deadlines the government proposes are not sufficient to allou Ms. Maxwell, who is\nincarcerated, to adequately prepare her defense.\n\nMs. Maxwell has made a specific shouing that early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of the\ngovernment’s witnesses is “both material to the preparation of [her] defense and reasonable in\nlight of the circumstances surrounding [her] case.” Cannone, 528 F.2d at 3oo-ol. First, the\nallegations are over 25 years old and any documentary records that witnesses may direct us to, if\nthey still exist, will be hard to retrieve and take time to collect. Second, the conduct relevant to\nthe charged crimes allegedly took place in three different locations across the country (New\nYork, Florida, and New Mexico) and in at least one foreign jurisdiction (London, England) over\na four-year period. Hence, it will take time to investigate any witness statements pertaining to\nthe alleged conduct, as well as to identify and interview other witnesses who may contradict the\ngovernment’s witnesses. See United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at\n*8-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> ordered where evidence located in multiple locations\nand offenses spanned three-year “extended period of time”). In particular, international travel\nmay be necessary to investigate statements by witnesses located in England or other foreign\njurisdictions, as will depositions pursuant to Rule l5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSee United States v. Savin, No. oo-CR-45 (RWS), 2ool WL 243533, *7-*9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7,\n2ool) (<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> ordered where offenses spanned “extended” six-year period and involved\npotential depositions of foreign witnesses). Third, for each witness identified, the defense will\nneed to search through the over 2.7 million pages of discovery to identify any relevant\ndocuments for cross-examination. The task is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming, as\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4237\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Pagellofl6\nthe vast majority of the discovery was produced as a “dump” of data from Epstein’s various\nelectronic devices, which includes hundreds of thousands of photographs, videos, and other files\nthat are not text searchable. See Rueb, 2ool WL 96l77, at *8 (<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> ordered where\ndefendant needed to review voluminous documentary evidence to prepare cross-examination).\nFourth, investigation of witness statements will face challenges and delays in light of the\ncontinuing travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-l9 pandemic and the reluctance of\nwitnesses to meet in person.\n\nBy contrast, the “possible dangers accompanying <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> (i.e. subornation of perjury,\nwitness intimidation, and injury to witnesses)” are non-existent in this case. Cannone, 528 F.2d\nat 3o2. Indeed, the government does not even atempt to argue that Ms. Maxwell, who is\ncurrently incarcerated, will atempt to threaten or intimidate witnesses if she is given their names.\nAccordingly, early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of the government’s witnesses is warranted.\n\nFor these same reasons, the Court should order the government to provide early\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any and all evidence of “other acts” that it intends to introduce under Rule 4o4(b).\nThe allegations in the Indictment already include conduct that purportedly took place in locations\nall over the United States and in England. Moreover, the government just disclosed in its\nopposition that it intends to have Accuser-3 testify about Ps\n[| that are not alleged in the Indictment and that PO\nee\n| | (Opp. l59). The government may seek to introduce evidence of “other acts” that took\nplace in new locations and possibly other foreign countries. Ms. Maxwell will not have\nsufficient time to investigate these allegations if she is not given adequate notice and therefore\nmust be given accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all Rule 4o4(b) evidence.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004239.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 287 Filed o5/2o/2l Page l2 of l6\n\nFinally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its\ntestifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. l84). Certain of\nthe Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made\nnumerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to\nthe media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any\nprior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s\nnumerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.\nMaxwell’s preparation for trial.°\n\nThe Court has already acknouledged that the defense will need substantial time to\nevaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the\ngovernment, over its objection, to produce certain Rule l6 materials related to non-testifying\nwitnesses by March l2, 2o2l—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can\nadequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). For the reasons set forth above, the Court should order\nthe production of all of the requested materials by March 22, 2o2l.\n\nWil. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Production and Inspection of\n\nDocuments.\n\nMs. Maxwell’s opening brief identified several redacted or incomplete documents that\nwere produced in discovery, and documents that were omited from discovery, that are subject to\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\nThe parties respectfully submit this joint leter in response to the Court’s Order dated May\nll, 2o2l, which directed the parties to meet and confer for at least 3o minutes by phone regarding\nthe overall pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule. (Dkt. No. 277). The parties met and conferred for\napproximately 8o minutes by telephone on this topic. Although the parties have agreed upon a\nschedule for some pretrial maters, the parties have not reached complete agreement on a full\nschedule. Accordingly, the parties set forth belou the proposed dates on which the parties agree,\nthe Government’s proposal, and the defendant’s proposal.\nThe parties agree on the follouing proposed dates:\ne The parties shall simultaneously file any motions in limine by October l8, 2o2l, or\n6 weeks in advance of trial. The parties shall simultaneously file any responses to\nmotions in limine by November l, 2o2l, or 4 weeks in advance of trial. The parties\nwill endeavor to have all motions fully briefed 4 weeks before trial in accordance\nwith the Court’s Order. The parties respectfully note that, as is the case in preparing\nfor any trial, to the extent additional issues arise that require briefing, the parties\nwill promptly bring such issues to the Court’s atention.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo425l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004253.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l Filed o5/2l/2l Page3ofl3\nPage 3\n\nto Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) by October ll, 2o2l, or 7 weeks in advance of trial. These\nmaterials will include testifying witness statements, which themselves will also include any co-\nconspirator statements about which witnesses may testify at trial. This deadline, which is far in\nadvance of when such disclosures are ordinarily made in this District, will provide the defense\nwith ample time to review these materials and prepare for trial. The proposed deadline for notice\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b) will provide the defense with ample time to review the\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and file any appropriate motions.\n\nThe defense has requested that the Government disclose Giglio and Jencks Act material 9\nweeks in advance of trial, arguing that these materials are necessary for the preparation of motions\nin limine. The Government respectfully notes that this proffered reason does not justify even\nearlier <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the material, particularly in light of the routine practice in this District to brief\nmotions in limine well in advance of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Giglio and Jencks Act material.’ Instead, the\nGovernment is prepared to provide the defense with such material 7 weeks in advance of trial,\nwhich is significantly earlier than in most cases and consistent with the common practice in this\nDistrict—even for trials held during the pandemic—as well as the Court’s April 26, 2o2l Order.’\n' See, e.g., United States v. Silver, l5 Cr. 93 (month-long bribery trial; 35oo material and\nGovernment exhibits produced approximately three weeks before trial (one week after motions in\nlimine)); United States v. Levin, l5 Cr. lol (two defendant, three-plus week fraud trial; 35oo\nmaterial produced two weeks before trial (three weeks after motions in limine; reciprocal exhibit\nlists exchanged six weeks before trial); United States v. Skelos, l5 Cr. 3l7 (two defendant, month-\nlong bribery trial; 35oo material and Government exhibits produced approximately one month\nbefore trial (one week prior to motions in limine)); United States v. Ulbricht, l4 Cr. 68 (three week\ncybercrime and narcotics trial; 35oo material produced one week before trial (more than three\nweeks after motions in limine)).\n> The Government respectfully notes that the law is clear in this Circuit that the Government is\nunder no obligation under the Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C. § 35oo et seq., to produce prior statements of\nits witnesses until after each witness has testified on direct examination. Courts in this Circuit\nhave consistently held that the district courts lack the pouer to mandate early production of Jencks\nmaterial. See, e.g., United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l45 (2d Cir. 2ool) (the “Jencks Act\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4253\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page4ofl3\nPage 4\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Feb. 22, 2o2l)\n(ordering Government <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Jencks Act and Giglio material 2 weeks before trial); United\nStates v. Cole, l9 Cr. 869 (ER), Dkt. No. 23 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. l8, 2o2o) (ordering <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nJencks Act and Giglio material 4 weeks before trial); see also United States v. Dupigny, l8 Cr. 528\n(JMF) (Government turned over Jencks Act material to the defense approximately one week before\nthe original trial date in sex trafficking case); United States v. Jones, l6 Cr. 553 (AJN)\n(Government turned over Jencks Act material approximately one week before trial); United States\nv. Lebedev, l5 Cr. 769 (AJN) (Government turned over Jencks Act material approximately 2 weeks\nbefore scheduled trial date); United States v. Corley, l3 Cr. 48 (RPP) (AJN) (Dkt. Entry, Oct. lo,\n2ol3) (Government turned over Jencks Act material less than one week before trial of defendant\ncharged with sex trafficking of a minor and possession of child pornography).\n\nThe Government is unaware of any case of comparable complexity and scope in which\nsuch an early deadline has been set for witness-related disclosures, and the defense has cited none.\nIndeed, even in complex white-collar cases in this District that involve far more complicated fact\npaterns than this case, the Government often provides 35oo material two weeks prior to trial, and,\nif the defendants agree to reasonable stipulations, four weeks before trial. See, e.g., United States\nprohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness statements.”); In re\nUnited States, 834 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir. l987). The Government recognizes that Giglio v. United\nStates, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972), requires <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any materials that might be used to impeach\nkey witnesses “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon\nthe information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 22l, 226 (2d Cir. 2oo7). In\nthis District, the time which is considered to allou for effective use of the material is typically\nmeasured in days or, at most, weeks, before trial. See, e.g., United States v. Underwood, No. o4\nCr. 424 (RWS), 2oo5 WL 927ol2, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2l, 2oo5) (Government ordered to produce\nGiglio material two business days before trial); United States v. Green, No. o4 CR. 424 (RWS),\n2oo4 WL 298536l, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2oo4) (noting “the widely accepted practice in this\ndistrict of producing impeachment material when [the Government] provides prior statements of\na witness pursuant to l8 U.S.C. § 35oo,” and ordering production of Giglio material by Friday\nbefore trial unless materials are voluminous).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004255.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page5ofl3\nPage 5\nv.

No. 66 (S.D.N.Y. July lo, 2ol8) (35oo material one month before securities fraud trial). The\ndefense’s request for yet earlier <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is unfounded and reflects a significant—and\nunwarranted—departure from the practices in this District.\n\nConsistent with the Government’s previously stated position (Dkt. No. 2o4 at l92), it is\nentirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through\nJencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government only intends to\nintroduce co-conspirator statements either through the testimony of witnesses, which will be\npreviewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the\nGovernment has previously noted, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that non-exculpatory\nco-conspirator statements are discoverable by Rule l6 or by any other means other than the Jencks\nAct. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. l987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing\nDistrict Court’s order directing the Government “to produce all oral statements made by the\ndefendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a\ndefendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol). The cases cited by the defense all involved orders granting\nbills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They\ndid not involve orders directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the Government\nmay introduce at trial. Indeed, the Government is unaware of any case in which such particularized\nnotice distinct from the production of Jencks Act and marked exhibits has been ordered, and the\ndefense cites none. This Court has already denied the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars\nfor Counts One through Four (see Dkt. No. 2o7 at l9), and the Government has separately\nsubmited its opposition to the defendant’s supplemental motion for a bill of particulars.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004256.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 6ofl3\nPage 6\n\nGovernment’s Proposed Exhibit List and Marked Exhibits\n\nThe Government is prepared to provide the defense with its proposed exhibit list and\nmarked exhibits by October 25, 2o2l, or 5 weeks in advance of trial. This deadline will allou the\ndefense adequate time to review and raise objections to any Government exhibits.\nDefense Disclosures\n\nThe Government proposes that the defense be required to provide expert witness\ndisclosures pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(C) by October 4, 2o2l, or 8\nweeks in advance of trial. This deadline will give the defendant ample time to determine what, if\nany, expert testimony she may seek to offer. The defense—who has had the Government’s expert\nnotice since April 23, 2o2l—-seeks to provide expert notice 4 weeks in advance of trial, or by\nNovember l, 2o2l, but such a belated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would not allou adequate time in advance of trial\nto brief any motions regarding the admissibility of such testimony, much less by the Court’s\ndeadline. See, e.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, No. S2 o9 Cr. ll84 (RJH), 2oll WL 72353o, at\n*3,*5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2oll) (reasoning that “the purpose of reciprocal expert disclosures is to\nminimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for\ncontinuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s\ntestimony through focused cross-examination.”; “Specifically, under Rule l6, a defendant’s\nobligation to make expert disclosures does not turn on whether the government will call a certain\nwitness or prove certain overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy—disclosures mentioned nouhere\nin the Rule—but on whether the government has made its oun expert disclosures.”) (internal\nquotations and citations omited); see also United States v. Jasper, No. oo Cr. 825 (PKL), 2oo3\nWL 2232l2, at *4 (S.D.N.Y.

The Government further notes that the\ndefense’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> date would not provide sufficient time for the Government to locate\na rebutal expert if appropriate or to provide notice of that rebutal expert to the defense. Because\nexperts are typically not available on a mater of weeks’ notice, it cannot be the case that the\ndefense will wait to review Jencks Act materials before contacting and retaining experts; there is\nno basis for delaying <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of this information to the Government, particularly given the delay\nthis will cause to resolving any potential Daubert issues before trial.\n\nIn addition, the Government proposes that the defense provide a proposed witness list and\nwitness statements, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2, and disclosures pursuant\nto Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) by November l, 2o2l, or 4\nweeks in advance of trial. This deadline will provide the defense with ample time to determine\nwhat, if any, defense witnesses may testify at trial. This deadline will also permit the Government\nadequate time to review these materials and raise any appropriate objections or motions in advance\nof trial.\n\nDefendant's Position\n\nMs. Maxwell respectfully proposes the follouing pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule:\n\ne May 24 — government discloses identities of alleged victims.\n\ne Sept. 27 (9 weeks before trial) — government discloses Jencks Act/35oo\nmaterial, Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and notice, the government’s\nwitness list, any co-conspirator statements it intends to introduce at trial, and\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4257\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004258.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page 8ofl3\nPage 8\nthe identity of any unindicted co-conspirator.\n\ne Oct. ll (7 weeks before trial) — government discloses exhibit list.\n\n¢ Oct. l8 (6 weeks before trial) — simultaneous filing of motions in limine.*\n\ne Oct. 25 (5 weeks before trial; 3 weeks before jury selection) — simultaneous\nfiling of proposed jury questionnaire and voir dire.\n\ne Nov. l (4 weeks before trial) -responses to motions in imine.\n\ne Nov. l (4 weeks before trial) — defense expert witness <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\ne Nov. 8 (3 weeks before trial) — simultaneous filing of requests to charge and\nverdict sheet.\n\ne At the close of the government’s case-in-chief — defense discloses Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) and l6(b)(l)(B) materials, defense witness list and Rule 26.2\nstatements.\n\nMs. Maxwell hereby states, in accordance with the Court's directive (Dkt. 277), her\npoints of disagreement with the government's proposed schedule.\nIdentities of Accusers\n\nThe government offers no justification for continuing to withhold defense counsel,\nsubject to the protective order, the identities of the alleged victims in this case, so that the\ndefense can adequately prepare for trial. The government has never argued that Ms. Maxwell\npresents a safety risk to these witnesses. Any privacy concerns are already diminished in light\n3 The defense reserves the right to file additional motions in limine at a later time after a\nthorough review of the Jencks Act material and the government’s exhibits. The government\npreviously has indicated to counsel that the Jencks Act materials total in the \"lou thousands\"\nof pages. In addition, the defense anticipates that many evidentiary issues cannot be decided\nprior to the presentation of evidence and will necessarily be raised in the context of a particular\nwitness’s testimony.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004259.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l Filed o5/2l/2l Page9ofl3\nPage 9\n\nof the fact that some accusers have spoken publicly about this case. The government’s\nprincipal justification for withholding their identities until September l3 is that earlier\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would be inconsistent with the “practice” of the office. This is not a sufficient\nreason to withhold this information where any investigation of these accusers has to take place\nunder the onerous conditions of COVID.\n\nDefendant's Proposal for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Jencks Act/35oo and Giglio Material, Rule 4o4(b)\nEvidence and Notice, and Government Witness and Exhibit Lists\n\nThe defense believes that shifting the deadlines up two weeks for motions in limine to\nbe fully briefed four weeks prior to trial (Dkt. 277) necessitates a concomitant two week\nadvancement of the dates for the government to produce Jencks Act/35oo and Giglio material,\nRule 4o4(b) evidence and notice, and the government's witness and exhibit lists.\n\nThe government’s proposal allous only one week for the defense to review thousands\nof pages of 35oo material before filing motions in /imine, and the government proposes\ndisclosing its exhibit and witness lists one week after the in limine deadline. As discussed at\nthe April 23d arraignment, the defense needs sufficient time in advance of the in limine\ndeadline to review the materials and draft the appropriate motions.*- The government's\nproposed process will frustrate the Court's aim of having in /imine issues briefed four weeks\nin advance of trial to the extent possible.\n\nThe cases cited by the government in which disclosures were made closer to trial are\nwholly inapposite. In each of the cited cases, charges were filed nearly contemporaneously\nwith the alleged crimes. Cole (indictment of 2 year conspiracy charged 4 years later); Dupigny\n“Tt bears repeating that two of Ms. Maxwell's counsel will be in other trials from September l3\nthrough October 22, i.e., the entire time between <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the Jencks Act material and the in\nlimine filing deadlines, further hampering efforts to efficiently review and develop any legal\nbriefing on issues presented by the materials.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page lo of l3\nPage lo\n\n(2 year conspiracy charged the follouing year); Jones (l year conspiracy charged the same\nyear); Lebedev (2 year conspiracy charged in the second year); Corley (2 year conspiracy\ncharged in January of the follouing year). None involved, as this one does, allegations of a\nlo-year conspiracy charged 25 years later. None involved accusers who were located in at\nleast one foreign country, possibly more, for whom investigation will have to occur during\nthe midst of pandemic. The cases do not involve the same \"length\" or complexity of this one.\nCo-Conspirator Identities and Statements\n\nRegarding co-conspirator identities and statements, the government backtracked on its\nprevious representations to counsel and the Court. Ms. Maxwell sought early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nboth in her pretrial motions (Dkt. l48 at l3-l4), and the government promised it would give\n\"notice of any co-conspirator statements that the Government may seek to introduce through\nwitness statements\" sufficiently in advance of trial to permit objections by the defense. (Dkt.\n2o4 at l92) The Court agreed. (Dkt. 2o7 at 3o-3l). During recent conferrals on the schedule,\nhouever, the government made clear its intent to imbed any co-conspirator statements in the\nbulk of its Jencks/35oo material rather than separately disclose either the identity of any\npurported unindicted co-conspirator or their anticipated testimony. The government also\nstated for the first time its intent to identify any unindicted co-conspirator documentary\nstatements (e.g., emails between Epstein and any number of thousands of persons) only when\nit produces its exhibit list, one week after the in limine filing deadline. Neither government\nproposal will allou Ms. Maxwell to raise appropriate objections to the materials sufficiently\nin advance of trial, nor promote briefing during the in imine motions. Indeed, the government\nfails to explain hou Ms. Maxwell can object in limine to exhibits containing purported co-\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo426o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004261.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page llofl3\nPage ll\nconspirator statements when they are not produced until after the in limine deadline has\npassed.\n\nDistrict judges in this Circuit routinely order the government to disclose the identities\nof alleged co-conspirators in advance of trial to offset the \"risk of surprise to the defendant,\"\nespecially if \"there are a large number of co-conspirators and a long-running conspiracy.\"\nSee, e.g., United States v. Akhavan, S3 2o-cr-l88 (JSR), 2o2o WL 2555333 at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nMay 24, 2o2o).° In Akhavan, involving only a three-year conspiracy, Judge Rakoff\ndetermined the \"complex series of events over a number of years\" warranted a bill of\nparticulars disclosing the names of the alleged co-conspirators. See also United States v.\nBarnes, l58 F.3d 662, 666 (2d Cir. l998). Unlike Akhavan, here the government has made\nno shouing that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the names of unindicted co-conspirators would jeopardize its\nongoing investigation into events that happened a quarter of a century ago.\n\nThe defense anticipates interposing significant objections to introduction of any\npurported co-conspirator statements (whether through witness testimony or documentary\nevidence) at trial and needs to litigate their admissibility before trial. Given that motions in\nlimine need to be fully briefed at least four weeks before trial, we request that the government\nidentify any co-conspirator's names and statements (whether via witness testimony or\n> See also United States v.

All proposed\nopinion testimony must be \"relevant to the task at hand.” Daubert v. Merrell Dou\nPharmaceuticals, 5o9 U.S. 579, 597 (l993). To be reliable, the proposed expert must have,\ninter alia, \"applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United States\nv. Williams, 5o6 F.3d l5l, l6o (2d Cir. 2oo7) (emphasis supplied, citations omited). Any\ndefense expert that relates to the testimony of the accusers or 4o4(b) witnesses cannot possibly\nbe disclosed before Ms. Maxwell has even been provided access to that testimony.\n\nTo illustrate the point, one need look only at the government's expert <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. The\nproposed testimony for the government's expert, although purportedly not based on a review\nof the facts of this case, nevertheless appears to have been crafted by the government with full\nknouledge of the accusers’ specific allegations. For example, the government proffers that\ntheir expert will testify that \"minor victims ... may not identify themselves as victims of abuse\nwhile it is ongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood.\"\nClearly, the accusers must have represented facts to support these contentions or else there\nwould be no grounds to admit this \"blind\" expert opinion testimony. Ms. Maxwell cannot be\nexpected to hire experts and divine what would be relevant to this case before she is provided\nthe statements by these accusers, whose credibility will be the central question for the jury in\nthis case.\n\nThe Court originally ordered the defense expert disclosures four weeks before trial and\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004263.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 29l _ Filed o5/2l/2l Page l3 of l3\nPage l3\nthree weeks after receipt of the witness statements. Ms. Maxwell requests the same deadline.\nDefense Disclosures Pursuant to Rules l6 and 26.2 and Defense Witness List\nRegarding the defense Rule l6 disclosures and witness lists, Ms. Maxwell proposes to\n\nproduce those at the close of the government's case. As she explained in connection with Rule\n26.2 disclosures (Jt. Leter of May 3, 2o2l), gaining access to Ms. Maxwell’s witness list and\nexhibits prior to trial gives an advantage to the government to the detriment of the defense. A\nrecent decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is instructive. Finding that the state equivalent\nof Rule l6, like its federal counterpart, does not authorize pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of defendant's\nexhibits, the court also concluded that such <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> \"arguably infringes on [the defendant's]\nconstitutional rights,\" by \"helping the prosecution meet its burden of proof,\" \"tip[s] his hand\nvis-a-vis his investigation and theory of defense,\" and \"in effect, forces [him] to share with\nthe prosecution his trial strategy — l.e., hou he plans to defend against the charges against\nhim.\" People v. Kilgore, 455 P.3d 746, 75l (Colo. 2o2o). \"Put differently, the [pretrial]\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> requirement rests on shaky constitutional ground because it improperly risks\nlessening the prosecution's burden of proof.\" /d.

It probably would be subject to a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\nbut it is not something that we would distribute without compulsory process.”!'!® Villafafia told\nOPR that she believed Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public because he “did not want\npeople to believe him to have commited a variety of crimes.” As she explained to OPR, Villafafia\nbelieved the NPA did not need to be disclosed in its entirety, but she anticipated notifying the\nvictims about the NPA provisions relating to their ability to recover damages.\nE. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\n\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\n\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\n\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\n\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\n\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\n\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\n\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\n\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\n\ntime in state custody.\n\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\n\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\n\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines. I\n\ntold him that I had no objection to that approach but, in the interest\n\nof full <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, I did not believe that Mr. Epstein would be eligible\n\nbecause he will not be in Zone A or B.'!’ This morning Jay\n\nLefkouitz called and said that I was correct but, if we could get\n\nMr. Epstein doun to l4 months, then he thought he would be\n\neligible.\n\nMy response: have him plead to two separate Informations.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed\n\n[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some\n\nkind of federal charge).\n\nBut that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 3o months total,\n\nand l8 in jail.\n\nHou can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is\n\nnot unduly endangered in jail?\nAcosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the\nAUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and\nthey had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,\nand she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”\n\nL. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she\nchanged the confidentiality provision to the follouing:\n\n83\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004408.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll of 349\nThe parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of\nany public record.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7: ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager]. I don’t anticipate it going any further than\n\nthat. When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy\n\nto you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will be kept\n\nconfidential since it also contains identifying information about the\n\ngirls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the atorney representative for\n\nthe girls, we can discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the\nl28 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Lourie observed that because the NPA contained names of uncharged\nco-conspirators and other protected information, the USAO would have a duty to redact the information before\ndisclosing the NPA.\n\n84\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll3 of 349\nit had identified as victims.'°! The USAO, with the good faith approval of\nEpstein’s counsel, would select an atorney representative for the victims,\nwhom Epstein would pay.\n\nTiming: Epstein would make his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be sentenced\nby October 26, 2oo7. The USAO had no objection to Epstein self-reporting\nto begin serving his sentence by January 4, 2oo8.\n\nImmunity: The USAO would not initiate criminal charges against “any potential\nco-conspirator of Epstein,” including four named personal assistants.\n\nOther: Epstein was obligated to undertake discussions with the State Atorney’s\nOffice to ensure compliance with this agreement.\n\nEpstein waived his right to appeal.\n\nEpstein agreed that he would not be afforded any benefits with respect to\ngain time or other rights, opportunities, and benefits not available to any\nother inmate.\n\nThe federal investigation would be suspended and all pending legal process\nheld in abeyance unless and until Epstein violated any term of the\nagreement. Evidence “requested by or directly related to” the pending legal\nprocess, “including certain computer equipment,” would be kept inviolate\nuntil all the NPA terms had been satisfied.\n\nBreach: The USAO would be required to notify Epstein of any alleged breach of the\nagreement within 9o days of the expiration of the term of home\nconfinement, and would be required to initiate prosecution within 6o days\nthereafter.\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>: The parties “anticipate[d]” that the agreement would not be made part of\nany public record, and if the USAO received a Freedom of Information Act\nrequest or compulsory process commanding <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the agreement, it\nwould provide notice to Epstein before making any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. !*\n\nThat evening, Lefkouitz emailed Lourie to express concern about the notification he\nunderstood would be given to Chief Reiter, stating, “I am very concerned about leaks unduly\nprejudicing Jeffrey [Epstein] in the media.”!°? He added, “I have enjoyed working with you on\nHe The USAO had not informed the defense of the victims’ identities at this point. The parties anticipated that\nthe USAO would send Epstein’s atorneys a list of victims when Epstein fulfilled his obligation under the NPA to\nenter his state guilty pleas.\n\nl32 The final NPA is atached as Exhibit 3 to this Report.\nl33 On October 3, 2oo7, the Miami FBI media officer notified the USAO that the New York Post had reported\nthat federal authorities were not going to pursue federal charges against Epstein. According to the Post, Epstein would\nplead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes, “in a deal that will send him to prison for about l8 months,” folloued\nby “a shorter period of house confinement,” and, according to “sources,” federal authorities had “agreed to drop their\n86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo44lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004469.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page l72 of 349\nand guaranteed sexual offender registration by Epstein . . . were\namong the factors [that led to the NPA].7!°\n\nDuring her OPR interview, Villafafia similarly described the victims’ general reluctance to\ngo forward with a trial:\n\n[W]hen we would meet with victims, we would ask them hou they\nwanted the case to be resolved.

They were very worried about their privacy\nrights.'°\n\nIn his writen response to OPR, Lourie stated that although he did not specifically recall\nthe issues Villafafia set forth in her declaration, he believed they would have been important to the\nUSAO in 2oo7. Lourie also told OPR that he generally recalled concerns within the USAO about\nthe charges and a potential trial:\n\n[M]y vague recollection is that I and others had concerns that there\n\nwas a substantial chance we would not prevail at both trial and on\n\nappeal after a conviction, resulting in no jail time, no criminal\n2l5 Doe v.

Marie Villafafia in Support of\nGovernment’s Response and Opposition to Petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and Cross-Motion for\nSummary Judgment at 8-9 (June 2, 2ol7).\n2l8 These concerns are also reflected in a 2ol7 declaration filed by the FBI case agent in the CVRA litigation,\nin which she stated, “During interviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that\nEpstein be prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s] victims... .\n\nA majority of the victims expressed concern about the possible <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their\n\nidentities to the public. A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4469\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004510.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2l3 of 349\nparties.7°* The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was\n\ndealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s\n\nunderstood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you\n\nknou the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004525.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 228 of 349\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\n\nA. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about\n\nResolving the Federal Investigation\n\nVillafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask\nthem hou they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!\n\nAnd most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some\nof them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did\nnot want to have to come to court and testify. They were very\nworried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go\nto jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with\nthe State Atorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to\nthe State Atorney’s Office was not something that they would have\nsupported.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about\ntheir safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the\ninvestigation. In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the\n\npossible <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities to the public. A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4525\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004529.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 232 of 349\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”???\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\n\n282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\ni The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n2o4 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4529\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004530.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 233 of 349\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””> Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\nto do the right thing. . . . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\ndisagree with the outcome . . . but the point is they weren’t trying\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of .. .\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\nto do but .. . it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. . . . I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.?”° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\na Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAO].”\n\n296 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo453o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004564.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 267 of 349\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.3”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.?””\n\nSl6 In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4564\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004584.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 287 of 349\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’*°’\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this case,\nconsulting with the victims about a potential plea would have given the USAO greater insight into\nthe victims’ willingness to support a prosecution of Epstein. The consultation provision does not\n4o7 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n26o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4584\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004596.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 299 of 349\nargued that Acosta should have been able to rely on his staff to accomplish the victim notification\ntask, and thus had no responsibility to personally confirm that Chief Reiter would notify the\nvictims of the hearing.*”® Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances, USAO management\nplayed no role in the victim notification process; houever, in this case, the issue of victim\nnotification had been elevated from a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the\ndefense. Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*”°\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\n428 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\n429 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4596\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 3o6 of 349\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*°\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).*4 Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\nHe 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, J B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\n\n“44 The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-oooo46o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 334 of 349\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Sixth, a bill of particulars is not warranted, especially when\nboth the speaking indictment and discovery in this case provide ample details regarding the\ncharged offenses. Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of impeachment\nmaterial regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this\nCourt’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.\nARGUMENT\nI. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding\nIndictment\nIn an Opinion and Order dated April l6, 2o2l, the Court denied the defendant’s previous\nmotion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2oo7 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between\nJeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-\nSDFL”). The Court concluded, among other things, that “under controlling Second Circuit\nprecedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Atorney for the Southern District of New York.” (Apr.\nOp. at 3). In reaching this conclusion, the Court folloued United States v. Annabi, 77l F.2d 67o,\n672 (2d Cir. l985) (per curiam), which held that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the\nUnited States Atorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears\nthat the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Apr. Op. at 4). The defendant nou moves\nto dismiss again based on the NPA. The bulk of the defendant’s motion discusses the similarity\nbetween the additional charges in the S2 Indictment and the crimes enumerated in the immunity\nprovisions of the NPA. But it does not mater what—or whom—the NPA purports to immunize,\nsince the Court has already concluded that, under Annabi, the NPA does not bind this District.\nThe defendant cannot clear the initial hurdle of establishing that the NPA applies in this\nDistrict and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April\nOpinion, the defendant nou claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo47l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 295 Filed o5/25/2l Page 24 of 26\nGiven the information the defendant already has from the Indictment and discovery, any additional\ndetail would essentially serve as early Jencks Act production. The discovery gives the defense\nample information to assist in its investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to\nunderstand who Minor Victim-4 is from the productions, (see, e.g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),\nthere is no real concern that the defense will waste efforts conducting any such investigation before\nreceiving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on a\nsimilar issue in this case, the motion for a bill of particulars should be denied.\n\nVII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,\nWhich Do Not Warrant Immediate <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe defendant moves for the immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any prior inconsistent statement\nmade by Minor Victim-4. In other words, the defense seeks immediate production of impeachment\nmaterial for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has already noted in prior\nbriefing, it is aware of its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations and intends to produce Giglio material for all of\nits witnesses, including Minor Victim-4, at least six weeks in advance of trial. Consistent with the\npractice in this District, the Court has previously concluded that such time is sufficient for the\ndefense to prepare for trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 3o).\n\nThe Government agrees that any prior statement in which Minor Victim-4 discussed her\ninteractions with Epstein, but omited mention of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense\nin advance of trial.

If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |\nMaterials from <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was\nUnreasonable |\nUnder Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |\n(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |\nprotective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |\nmodified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |\nmodification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 23o, 232 (2d Cir. l982) (emphasis added) |\n(internal quotation omited). |\nI will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |\nSchiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |\nsubpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |\npermited Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |\ncompliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the Protective Order in deciding |\nwhether and hou to comply with various discovery requests. The question to be decided is |\nwhether such reliance was reasonable. |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo89o |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo494o |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004942.jpg": "; Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page l9 of 27\n\n| To Be Filed Under Seal |\n\nwhile the Protective Order also had a permanent aspect about it—i.e., it provides for the return or\ndestruction of documents upon conclusion of the case (see Protective Order  l2)—this provision\nneither trumped the law concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor |\nspecifically required the designating party to maintain confidentiality over its oun designated |\nmaterials once the Protective Order expired. (See id.) |\nOf course, this case contains an unusual fact that might seem to render Maxwell’s |\nreliance on a blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against even <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> pursuant to a grand |\njury subpoena. We knou that Maxwell refused to agree to any Protective Order containing a :\nprovision that is customary in all the protective orders entered by this Court: a provision |\n|\npermiting the production of confidential materials to law enforcement without further order of |\nthe court. (See Def.’s Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |\n49 at 5.) This might seem ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of her motion for entry of a |\nprotective order, that prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (/d.) |\nBut whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did indeed bargain for such a provision; |\nand for whatever reason, Giuffre and Boies Schiller agreed to it. |\nHouever, the Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet contains a provision that permits |\nthe court to order <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Confidential Material in circumstances other than those listed in |\nParagraph 5 (a)-(h), See Protective Order J 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not, |\nwithout the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”) |\n(emphasis added). All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate |\nwhen there is no need for the opponent’s consent or a court order before <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> can be made. |\n|\nAs the Protective Order plainly gives the court the pouer to enter an order compelling <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> !\nto anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not reasonably have relied on the |\nSDNY_GM_ooooo892 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4942 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004943.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 2o of 27\n\n; To Be Filed Under Seal\n\nabsence of automatic permission for such <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to shield anything she said or produced from\n\na grand jury’s scrutiny. As the court reasoned in EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32l, language stating that\nthe party receiving designated confidential information “shall not use or disclose the information |\nexcept... by such orders as may be issued by the Court during the course of this litigation” did\n“not lend itself to reasonable reliance that [the Protective Order] will afford permanent secrecy.”\n|\nSee also Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l26 (2d Cir. 2oo6), where, in view |\nof a provision that said, “This Confidentiality Order shall not prevent anyone from applying to |\n|\nthe Court for relief therefrom,” the Second Circuit held, “Given this provision, it is difficult to |\nsee hou the defendants can reasonably argue that they produced documents in reliance on the |\nfact that the documents would always be kept secret.” |\nThird, there is no evidence before me indicating that the court undertook any sort of |\ndetailed inquiry prior to entering the Protective Order. (Hrg. Tr., l5-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66 at |\n4:25-5:l2.). Obviously, I was not there, but I have reviewed the transcript of the argument on |\nthe motion for a protective order, and it seems clear that the parties were given ample discretion |\nto designate discovery materials as confidential, with virtually no oversight unless those |\nmaterials were to be filed with the court—in which case a motion for sealing had to be made.° |\n(Protective Order § lo); cf Liton Indus., Inc. v. Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc., l22 F.R.D. 433, |\n435 (S.D.N.Y. l988) (declining to enforce protective order where “the protective order did not |\nadjudicate the appropriateness of confidentiality as to particular items of discovery”). The fact |\n“The question about a protective order, of course there should be a protective order in this case. You are |\ngood lawyers, and you have been around this track more times than I have and so you can prepare consensually a\nbeter protective order than I can, and I urge you to do that. And, in fact, I will give you two weeks to do that.\nShould you fail, you can present whatever materials you wish to me and I will decide what the protective order is |\ngoing to be. That’s not a good idea because you knou the case beter than I do, obviously, and so I urge you to\nresolve it by your litigation skills and not leave it up to the ignorant district court judge who doesn’t really get into\na of thing very often.

The parties\nalso setled just a short time before trial; such a setlement could have been occasioned, at least in )\npart, to avoid the public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any confidential materials. |\nHouever, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |\nis that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |\nforward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |\ninvestigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :\nGiuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |\njury to look into the maters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |\nGovernment has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |\nwho might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |\nthat it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |\nexistence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |\nmoment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |\nMoreover, the Assistant United States Atorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |\nwhat is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knous every witness who was deposed stood |\non his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |\nThe literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |\n:\nConfidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shoun.” (Protective Order, {[ l4.) :\nAny party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |\nMaterials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |\nduly empouered grand jury seeks their production.\nSDNY_GM_ooooo895 |\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4945 |\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004946.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 3ll-4 Filed o7/o2/2l Page 23 of 27\n\nTo Be Filed Under Seal |\nThis decision accords with those of other courts in this Circuit. “Where a protective |\norder contains express language that limits the time period for enforcement, anticipates the |\npotential for modification, or contains specific procedures for disclosing confidential materials to |\nnon-parties, it is not reasonable for a party to rely on an assumption that it will never be |\nmodified.” EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 32o. More to the point, “Uncertainty about the ultimate |\noutcome of a protective order will mean that no deponent may always effectively rely on a |\nprotective order to secure his right against self-incrimination.” Andover Data Servs., 876 F.2d |\nat lo84 (quoting Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d l468, l478 (4th Cir. l988)). |\nBecause Maxwell’s reliance on the Protective Order to shield her from the court-ordered |\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Confidential Materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena was unreasonable, the |\nCourt may exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application. “Where a litigant or |\ndeponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of a protective order, a court may |\nproperly permit modification of the order. In such a case, whether to lift or modify a protective |\norder is a decision commited to the sound discretion of the trial court.” TheStreet.Com, 273 |\nF.3d at 23l (internal quotation omited); accord Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, |\nl42 n.7 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (“If reliance would be unreasonable, it is within the discretion of the court |\nto vacate or modify a protective order.”). |\nFor the reasons discussed belou, the Court finds that modification of the Protective Order :\nis appropriate to aid law enforcement.\nE.

See Talco Contractors, Inc., |\n\nl53 F.R.D. at 5ll. Houever, the Second Circuit has recognized that this requirement may be |\nmet in circumstances involving significant public interest, particularly where no good cause |\nshouing was made to the court initially. See Agent Orange, 82l F.2d at l48 (“exceptionally |\n|\n\npervasive protection granted appellants during the pretrial stages of this litigation, coupled with |\nthe fact that appellants never were required to shou good cause,” as well as the fact that there |\nwas “enormous public interest in the Agent Orange litigation,” demonstrated extraordinary |\ncircumstances); but see Ionosphere Clubs, l56 B.R. at 435 (“[M]ere breadth” of a protective |\norder does not, by itself constitute “extraordinary circumstances.”).

Maxwell’s\nmotion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion\n& Order.

It is for the\nGovernment to make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations so that\nthe defense may make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial. See United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44-46 (2d Cir. 2ool).

The government’s objection comes too late.\n' As directed by the Court, on August 24 the parties conferred about the government’s\nleter, but they were unable to reach an agreement on the government’s requests for\nreconsideration.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5ol9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005020.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 33l _ Filed o8/3o/2l Page2of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 3o, 2o2l\nPage 2\n\nThe government’s objection is, in substance, a motion to reconsider. “There is ‘no\nspecific rule, either in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or in this district’s local criminal\nrules that provide for reconsideration of a ruling in a criminal mater.’” United States v.\nOkparaeke, No. l7-CR-225 (NSR), 2ol9 WL 4233427, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2ol9) (quoting\nUnited States v. Cartagena, No. lo Cr. 222-2, 2ol2 WL 2958l75, at *l (S.D.N.Y. July 2o,\n2ol2)). Even so, courts have discretion to reconsider prior rulings in criminal cases when the\nmoving party can point to “controlling law or factual maters which it believes the court\noverlooked and that might reasonably be expected to alter the court’s decision.” United States v.\nBerger, l88 F. Supp. 2d 3o7, 328-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nBut “[t]he standard for granting a motion for reconsideration ‘is strict.’” Farmer v.\nUnited States, No. l2-CR-758/l5-cv-6287 (AJN), 2ol7 WL 3448ol4, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. lo,\n2ol7) (quoting Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., 684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir. 2ol2)).\nThat’s because “[r]econsideration of a court’s previous order is an ‘extraordinary remedy to be\nemployed in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.’” Montanile v.\nNat’l Broad. Co., 2l6 F. Supp. 2d 34l, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo2).\n\nThe government cannot shou extraordinary circumstances here. The government twice\nhad notice of Ms. Maxwell’s request for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and the government twice chose not to\nobject. The government cannot use a motion to reconsider to save itself from the consequences\nof its deliberate decisions. “[A] losing party” is not permited to “examin[e] a decision and then\nplug[] in the gaps of a lost motion with additional maters.” Berger, l88 F. Supp. 2d at 339.\nBecause that is exactly what the government is atempting to do, this Court should deny the\ngovernment’s request. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> this Court ordered.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o2o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005021.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 33l _ Filed o8/3o/2l Page3of5\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 3o, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nCo-Conspirator Statements\n\nThe government’s leter raises a second issue—<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the purported co-conspirator\nstatements it intends to offer at trial. The government says that, at least as of August l8, it\nintends to seek admission of co-conspirator statements from only two individuals: Jeffrey\nEpstein and the employee of Epstein’s referenced in paragraph 25(d) of the S2 Indictment. Dkt.\n32o at 2. But the government also hedges, allouing for the possibility that it might identify\n“statements for use at trial from additional co-conspirators.” Jd.\n\nBoth in its August l8 leter and during an August 24 conferral call, the government took\nthe position that it has no obligation to identify the specific statements it intends to offer under\nFederal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E). The government told defense counsel that Ms. Maxwell\ncould glean what statements might be offered from the government’s witness list and exhibit list,\nonce those lists are disclosed on October ll.\n\nThis Court has already resolved this mater, and the government’s position is another\nimproper atempt to obtain reconsideration.\n\nAfter conferral, the parties spelled out their positions with respect to the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of co-\nconspirator statements and the identities of co-conspirators. Dkt. 29l at 5, 8-9. On June 2, this\nCourt ordered the government to disclose “co-conspirator statements” no later than October ll.\nDkt. 297 at l. In the same order, the Court additionally ordered the government to disclose its\nwitness list and proposed exhibit list, also by October ll. /d. The Court then ordered the parties\nto file their motions in limine by October l8 and responses by November l.”\n\n> The in limine response date since has been advanced to October 25, 2o2l.

Nathan\nAugust 3o, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nIf <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the witness and exhibit lists were by themselves sufficient to give Ms.\nMaxwell notice of the specific co-conspirator statements the government intends to admit at trial,\nthis Court would not have separately ordered the government to disclose “co-conspirator\nstatements.” /d. But that’s not what the Court did.\n\nThere are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gatekeeper to the admission\nof alleged co-conspirator statements. The Supreme Court’s decision in Bourjaily v. United States\nrequires the Court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether statements of a co-\nconspirator are admissible under Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. l7l, l75-76 (l987). In making this\ndetermination, the Court must find that a conspiracy existed, that its members included the\ndeclarant and the party against whom the statement is offered, and that the statement was made\nduring the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75.\n\nIf the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as\nthis Court already ordered the government to do by October ll, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable\nto file a motion in limine by October l8 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator\nstatements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to\ndischarge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at l75-76. Although the government\nmay not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order.\n\nThe government’s leter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to\nreconsider its order. The government has not even atempted to identify “controlling law or\nfactual maters which it believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to\nalter the court’s decision.” Berger, l88 F. Supp. 2d at 328-39. And that’s because the Court\ndidn’t overlook anything.

NATHAN, District Judge:\n\nDefendant seeks the Government’s “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of the unnamed co-\nconspirators alleged in the S2 indictment.” Dkt. No. 33l at l. In its August l3 Opinion &\nOrder, this Court noted that the Government had not objected to Defendant’s two prior requests\nthat the Government identify the unnamed co-conspirators. Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l; see also Dkt.\nNo. 33l at l. On August l8, 2o2l, the Government filed a leter stating that it “objects to any\nrequirement that it provide an exhaustive list of co-conspirators, whether in a bill of particulars\nor otherwise . . . absent further order of the Court.” Dkt. No. 32o at l. The Court concludes that\nthe Government’s objection comes too late as the Government had multiple opportunities to raise\nits objection before this Court issued its opinion. For this and the foregoing reasons, the Court\nconcludes that at the same time that the Government discloses Jencks Act materials, the\nGovernment must also disclose to the Defendant the identities of all unnamed co-conspirators\nalleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at trial. See United States v. Bin Laden, 92 F.\nSupp. 2d 225, 24l (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo).\n\nEven if the Court were to find that the Government had not waived its objection, it would\nfind unpersuasive the Government’s justifications for withholding this information. “In\nconsidering whether to grant a request for identification of unnamed co-conspirators, ‘the Court\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o4o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005041.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 335 Filed o9/o3/2l Page2of3\nmust balance the risk of surprise to the defendant, which is enhanced if ‘there are a large number\nof co-conspirators and a long-running conspiracy’ with legitimate law enforcement concerns,\nsuch as the potential danger to co-conspirators and the risk of compromising continuing\ninvestigations.’” United States v. Akhavan, No. S3 2o-CR-l88(JSR), 2o2o WL 2555333, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. May 2o, 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Pinto-Thomaz, 352 F. Supp. 3d 287, 3o3\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol8).\n\nThe conspiracies charged are long-running, increasing the risk of surprise to the\nDefendant. See Akhavan, 2o2o WL 2555333, at *2. Count Three charges Maxwell with a\nconspiracy running from l994 to 2oo4 and Count Five charges a conspiracy running from 2ool\nto 2oo4. Dkt. No. l87 9 l7, 23. And as the Court has previously found, Maxwell is likely able\nto determine the names of the alleged victims described in the Indictment due to the\nGovernment’s extensive discovery, see Dkt. No. 2o7 at 2o; houever, this logic does not\nnecessarily extend to the identities of alleged co-conspirators. See Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 2d at\n24l.\n\nThe Government argues that there is no risk of surprise because “it currently intends” to\nintroduce the alleged co-conspirator statements of only two individuals. Dkt. No. 32o at 2. At\nthe same time, houever, the Government proffers that it “may change its view as it prepares for\ntrial.” Dkt. No. 32o at 2. The Court thus finds the Government’s reassurance hollou and\ninsufficient to ensure that the Defendant may adequately prepare her defenses. See Pinto-\nThomas, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 3ol-o2.\n\nMoreover, the Government has not alleged that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> here would create “potential\ndanger to co-conspirators” or risk “compromising continuing investigations.” See Akhavan,\n2o2o WL 2555333, at *2. It merely argues that disclosing the identities risks “harm to the\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005042.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 335 Filed o9/o3/2l Page3of3\nGovernment from restricting its proof at trial.’ Dkt. No. 32o at 3. The Government provides no\nexplanation for this purported harm and none is apparent to the Court. Thus, the Court finds that\nthis concern alone does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in this case or the need\nfor the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay.\nIn light of the interests discussed above and consistent with other courts that have required\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of co-conspirator identities to the defense, the Court will require the Government to\ndisclose the identities of any unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 indictment whom the Government intends to refer to at trial.\n\nAccordingly, the Court ORDERS that at the same time that the Government discloses\nJencks Act material, the Government shall also disclose to the defense the identities of any\nunnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2\nindictment to whom the Government will refer at trial.

As a result, issues relevant to this case need to be addressed in a sensitive\nand private seting.\n\nThe jury selection procedures normally used by this Court — l.e., group voir dire with\nquestioning exclusively by the judge — pose heightened problems to an effective and informative\nvoir dire in a case involving topics that are difficult to discuss, let alone in a large public forum.\nIt is typically anxiety producing and discomforting for jurors to make public disclosures.

But the\nGovernment refused to hand-deliver those materials to MDC as they have with previous\nproductions in this case.

The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections. And in any event, even marginally reduced exposure is significant to the Minor\nVictims.* There is a very meaningful difference between the names of victims appearing in some\ndark corner of the internet, and the names of the victims appearing in the news outlets that will be\nviewed by the friends, families (including children), and employers of the Minor Victims.\n\nD. The Defendant Has No Countervailing Interests at Stake, Much Less a Particularized\n\nNeed for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>.\n\nIn the context of the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of witness identifying information, the Second Circuit has\nidentified two primary interests of defendants: “(l) obtaining information needed for in-court and\nout-of-court investigation of the witness; and (2) enabling defense counsel to elicit information\nee\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo557l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005572.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page l8 of 4o\nthat might be relevant to the jury’s deliberations as to the credibility or knouledgeability of the\nwitness.” Marcus, 2oo7 WL 33o388, at *l (citing Marti, 42l F.2d at l266).

The defendant knous who the Minor Victims\nand other witnesses are and has conducted a fulsome investigation, as shoun by the defendant’s\nbrief in opposition. And the jury, which will also knou the true names of the Minor Victims, will\nfully understand whatever information the defense elicits on cross-examination or at trial.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so.

In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the government identified three purported co-conspirators for\npurposes of trial: Jeffrey Epstein, [x | Thc\ngovernment, houever, failed and refused to disclose “a// (or any) co-conspirator statements it\nintends to introduce at trial....” Instead, the government, circumventing the plain meaning of the\nCourt’s Order, offered that “[t]he Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5598\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5ofl2\nit intends to offer at trial ... in the Government’s production today or in its previous\nproductions.” And, circumnavigating this Court’s Order with Magellan-like skill, promised that,\nas the government “continues to prepare for trial” it will produce any additional co-conspirator\nstatements “in connection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” See, Ex.\nl.\nI. The Government Failed to Identify Any Purported Co-Conspirator\n\nStatements\n\nFor a statement to fall within the definition of Fed.R.Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E), “a court must\nfind (l) that there was a conspiracy, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party\nagainst whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the\ncourse of and (b) in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll96\n(2d Cir. l993). These conditions precedent are “[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the\nadmissibility of evidence” as referenced in Fed. R. Evid. lo4(a), and must be proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence. United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v. Tellier, 83 F.3d 578, 58o (2d Cir. l996), there must\nbe independent corroborating evidence of the existence of the conspiracy and the participation\ntherein of the declarant and the defendant. Jd.\n\nII. Ongoing Document Dumps Containing Thousands of Statements Do Not\n\nSatisfy the Court’s Order to Disclose\n\nThe government neither objected to Ms. Maxwell's request for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> nor the Court’s\nOrder requiring <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> at the same time. See Dkt. 3l7 at l2, n.l (citing Dkt. 29l and Dkt.\n293). The government’s reason for not wanting to disclose the statements was considered and\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005600.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page6ofl2\nrejected by the Court which ordered <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> at the same time as the government's witness list,\nRule 4o4(b) notice, exhibits, and 35oo materials no later than October ll, 2o2l, so that the\nDefense would not be surprised at trial and because of “the need for the parties to litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial....”” Dkt. 335 at 3.\n\nThe government seized multiple electronic devices, including computers and servers\nfrom alleged co-conspirator Epstein. These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005601.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page /7ofl2\nIll. The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any identified\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been difficult to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events. The failure of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of critical alleged coconspirator statements makes it\nimpossible to prepare a defense.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9ofl2\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant had acted willfully and in bad faith in not disclosing\nthe witness until the second day of trial after the prosecution's primary witness had testified. See\nid. at 4l6-l7. Accordingly, “[r]egardless of whether prejudice to the prosecution could have\nbeen avoided [by a less severe sanction] ..., it [was] plain that the case fit[ ] into the category of\nwillful misconduct in which the severest sanction [was] appropriate.” Jd. at 4l7; see also United\nStates v. Katz, l78 F.3d 368, 37l—72 (Sth Cir. l999) (government's failure to disclose the\n“photographs” to the defendant in the identical form it intended to produce them at trial was\neither an atempt to “sandbag” the defense or highly unprofessional conduct and therefore\nlimited the government to the use of black and white images); United States v. Campagnuolo,\n592 F.2d 852, 858 (Sth Cir. l979) (no abuse of discretion where, as here, a district judge for\nprophylactic purposes suppresses evidence that, under a valid discovery order, the government\nshould have disclosed earlier, even if the nondisclosure did not prejudice the defendants); United\nStates v. Wicker, 848 F.2d lo59, lo62 (loth Cir. l988) (in view of the district court's pressing\nschedule, the status of the present case, and the failure of a prior continuance and deadlines to\nensure timely discovery; a second continuance would not compensate for the prejudice imposed\nupon the defendant and the district court did not abuse its discretion in suppressing the\ngovernment's evidence).\n\nHere, the Court issued its <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> order months ago. The government did not agree\nwith the Order and sought reconsideration. The Court considered the government’s belated\nrequest and rejected the government’s “concern” that somehou its evidence would be limited at\ntrial. Of course, the government could have made a good faith effort to comply with the Order\nand, if some other statement came to the government’s atention before or during trial it could\nhave, in good faith, requested permission to supplement its proof. Instead, the government has\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo56o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005604.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 384 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pageloofl2\nwillfully violated the Order and has refused to produce statements that it obviously (l) is aware\nof and (2) could be easily identified by referring to a discovery page number or simply providing\nthe statement.\n\nMs. Maxwell had a very narrou windou of time to review and consider any alleged co-\nconspirator statements which has expired.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v.

In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F.

Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth.

Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo564l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005644.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, or late\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5644\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005645.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 24\n\nas to explain whatever a victim might do. Rocchio says that nondisclosure, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\nand incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are ““common” and therefore consistent with being sexually abused.\nBut since Rocchio does not contend that nondisclosure, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and incremental\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are the inevitable consequence of sexual abuse, then it’s necessarily also true that\nnondisclosure, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are inconsistent with being\nsexually abused. Rocchio’s testimony, therefore, adds nothing to the case, because the jury has\nno means to apply her opinions to the evidence and to determine whether yg\n—CSSCSCSCSCies\nSS\n\nRocchio’s opinions about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are not helpful to the jury, and they will serve only\nto prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. While the government will surely contend that\nRocchio will not opine as to the truthfulness of any of the alleged victims in this case, the\npractical effect of Rocchio’s opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse” is to suggest to the jury that those who delayed\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are telling the truth about the abuse they suffered. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at\n*6.° Because a witness’s credibility is solely within the province of the jury to determine,\nhouever, Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4(b) bars testimony that a witness is testifying truthfully.\nMoreover, Rocchio’s testimony serves to bolster the credibility of the victims, and such\nbolstering is impermissible. See United States v. Charley, l89 F.3d l25l, l267 (loth Cir. l999)\n(“In general, expert testimony which does nothing but vouch for the credibility of another\n> Of course, the court should not expect Rocchio to disavou the converse of this proposition—\nthat those who immediately disclose alleged abuse are lying.

Rocchio’s opinions on <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> opinion: that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5646\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005650.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 386-l Filed lo/29/2l Page2of4\noa U.S. Department of Justice\nee” United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since\nearning her Ph.D. in l995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School\nof Broun University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since\nshe entered private practice in l998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice\n\nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal\nnotice under Rule l6(b)(l)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert\nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a writen summary of any testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 7o2, 7o3, or 7o5 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as\nwell as the witness’s qualifications.\n\n' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal\nand state litigation. As a courtesy, a list of that testimony is also being produced to you today\nbearing Bates number 35o2-oo2.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo565l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005679.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document387 Filed lo/29/2l Pagel5of2l\nprejudicial to Ms. Maxwell and will mislead the jury into believing that the alleged sex acts\nbetween Epstein and Accuser-3 were unlawful.\n\nThe Second Circuit takes an “inclusionary approach” to Rule 4o4(b) evidence, which\nadmits “other act” evidence “that does not serve the sole purpose of shouing the defendant’s bad\ncharacter and that is neither overly prejudicial under Rule 4o3 nor irrelevant under Rule 4o2.\nCurley, 639 F.3d at 56 (citing United States v. Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “‘to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

The Second\nCircuit has recognized that this phenomenon has led to significant problems. /d. at l88-93.\n\n“TW |hen those officer experts come to court and simply disgorge their factual knouledge to the\njury, the experts are no longer aiding the jury in its factfinding; they are instructing the jury on\nthe existence of the facts needed to satisfy the elements of the charged offense.” /d. at l9l.\n\nBut “[t]he Government cannot satisfy its burden of proof by taking the easy route of\ncalling an ‘expert’ whose expertise happens to be the defendant.” /d.; see U.S. Const. amends. V,\nVI. Nor can the government circumvent the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo575o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005752.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 393 Filed lo/29/2l Page6oflo\n\nIn turn, if a prosecution witness offers expert opinion testimony under Rule 7o2, Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l6(l)(G) requires the government to make significant and\nsubstantive pretrial disclosures. The government must disclose “a writen summary of any\ntestimony that the government intends to use . . . during its case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(l)(G). The summary “must [also] describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons\nfor those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Id.\n\nThe government has not endorsed yy as cxpert witnesses\nunder Rule 7o2 or made any pretrial disclosures for these witnesses under Rule l6(l)(g).\nAccordingly, none of these witnesses can offer expert opinion testimony at trial. That means\nthese witnesses should not be permited to offer testimony on any of the follouing subjects:\n\ne Any expert “overview” testimony about the case, its origins, and the investigation.\n\nE.g., United States v. Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).!\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law enforcement) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence. There is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than\n\nwhat the overview witness assumed; objections could be sustained or the witness\n\ncould change his or her story.

Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005789.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page6 of 84\ntraumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it\noccurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is\nalso expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\nand secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety\nof reasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive\nevents is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005794.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page ll of 84\nUnited States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG), 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22,\n2ol9).\n\nInstead, the defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable, irrelevant, or\nprejudicial. To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5794\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005802.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it. But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. (dd.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005806.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of 84\nthey were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005811.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nIncremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, hou voluntary the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005813.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005814.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005815.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005816.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 84\nInstead, the Government will seek to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony as background in this case.\n“Daubert instructs that vigorous cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence are\nthe central tools available to an adversary who wishes to debunk an expert’s testimony.” Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE), Dkt. No. 335 at 37 (internal quotation marks omited) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S.\nat 594-595). Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.\nRocchio’s background testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering\ncontrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury\nunderstand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant\nand Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\nThe parties agree that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Her opinions are well within the\nrange of reasonable expert opinions, and so are sufficiently reliable to go to the jury. And they\nwill aid the jury in evaluating other testimony in this case. That is enough for the Court to admit\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony.\nII. The Evidence Contained in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l Leter is\n\nAdmissible\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government notified the defense of certain evidence it may offer\nat trial. In particular, the leter addressed and the expected testimony of one potential\nwitness. (See October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A). As the Government explained in its\nleter to the defense, the evidence constitutes direct evidence of the charged offenses, but the\nGovernment provided notice under Rule 4o4(b) in the alternative. That same day, the Government\nprovided the defense with i. along with copies of all other marked Government\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo58l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005823.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5823\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 42 of 84\nin their ability to investigate or move in limine. The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Background\n\nBoth the first and second superseding indictments described the defendant and Epstein’s\n\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-3.

(Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4).\n\nThe Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the pouer to order pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7). The\nCourt also explained that the “[c]o-conspirator statements may often be admited at trial on a\nconditional basis,” and to the extent that “can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary\nhere because the Government has commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six\nweeks in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.” (/d. at 3o-3l).\n\nThe defendant’s second bite at the apple came in the parties’ joint scheduling leter. (Leter,\nDkt. No. 29l). There, the defense requested that the Government “identify any co-conspirator’s\nnames and statements (whether via witness testimony or documentary evidence) at the same time\nas it discloses []35oo material,” so it could “litigate their admissibility before trial.” (/d. at ll-l2).\nThe Government responded that it is “entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of\nany co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits,” because any co-\nconspirator statements will be contained therein. (/d. at 5). The Government also noted that the\ndefendant cited no cases “directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the\nGovernment may introduce at trial.” (/d.)\n\nOn June 2, 2o2l, the Court adopted the “Government’s proposal” and set a deadline of\nOctober ll, 2o2l, for the “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Jencks Act and Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005841.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 58 of 84\nnotice, co-conspirator statements, and Government witness list,” as well as the “Defendant’s\nproposal” that the Government disclose its proposed exhibit list that same day. (Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery\nproduction. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo584l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005842.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 59 of 84\n\nOn September 3, 2o2l, the Court ordered the Government to “disclose to the Defendant\nthe identities of all unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at\ntrial.” (Order at l, Dkt.

The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant. The Jencks Act materials and exhibits contained the only co-\nconspirator statements in the Government’s possession that will be offered at trial. It also disclosed\nthe identities of the individuals to whom it may refer at trial as co-conspirators and informed the\ndefendant that it “has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at trial ...\nin the Government’s production [that day] or in its previous productions.” (Def.

Discussion\n\nThe Government has complied with its pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, consistent with the\nCourt’s orders and on a schedule with deadlines well in advance of trial. As of October ll, the\nGovernment produced all co-conspirator statements in its possession that it intends to offer at trial.\nTo the extent that the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it prepares for\ntrial—such as in a session preparing a witness for trial—it will produce those statements as part of\nits ongoing Jencks Act obligations.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5842\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005843.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document397 Filed lo/29/2l Page 6o of 84\n\nThe defense errs when it suggests that the Court ordered the Government to specifically\nitemize any co-conspirator statements contained in its disclosures. When the Court first set a\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which\nopposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness\nstatements. (Order at l, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the\nidentities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator\nstatements, citing the Court’s earlier order. (Order at 2, Dkt. No. 335). Neither order expressly\ndirected the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial\nseparately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.\n\nA requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,\nthe Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.\n(Op. & Order at 3o-3l, Dkt. No. 2o7). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on\nthis issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the\nGovernment to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the\nconvenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an\norder would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For\na third, the guiding principle of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation\nof those statements’ admissibility pre-trial. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such\nstatements can be conditionally admited during the trial, and their admissibility litigated\nthereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 26o, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969)); Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7.

And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring\n“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.\n\nThe Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to\nserve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and\nitemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize\nJencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail\nfor the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks\nAct material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without\nprecedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the\nGovernment’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of\ncertain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the\nrecord to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.\n\nThe defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator\nstatements contained in its Jencks Act production.

The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5893\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005900.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, because in the event of\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59oo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005904.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005906.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005907.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005908.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-l Filed lo/29/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming. Based on the above findings it seems\n\nnecessary to provide a new definition that atempts to encapsulate the complexity of sexual\n\ngrooming, while still being easy to understand. We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo59o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005912.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 397-2 Filed lo/29/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (3) age and gender significantly influence <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.

Of those who did disclose, 8o.5 per cent\nmentioned a ‘friend of my oun age’ as the only person who they had told. In\nthis study, 6.8 per cent had reported their experiences to the social authorities\nor police. A further Swedish study of l22 women who had experienced\nchildhood sexual abuse (Jonson and Lindblad, 2oo4) found that 32 per cent\ndisclosed during childhood (before the age of l8) while the majority told in\nadulthood (68%). The delay was up to 49 years, with an average of 2l years\n(SD = l2.9). Of those who told in childhood, 59 per cent told only one person.\nIn Ireland, the SAVI study (n = 3ll8, McGee e¢ al., 2oo2) found that 47 per\ncent of those respondents who had experienced some form of sexual assault\nprior to age l7 had told no-one of this experience until the survey.

The issue of partial disclosures was highlighted by\nearlier studies such as those by DeVoe and Faller (l999) of five- to ten-year\nolds (i.e. making detailed informal disclosures that were not replicated in\nformal interviews) and Elliot and Briere (l994) of children aged eight to\nl5 years (i.e. disclosing only partial information until confronted with external\nevidence that led to more complete disclosures).\n\nMore recently, investigators have examined the role of the interviewer and\nquestioning styles in the forensic interview and hou this impacts on children’s\ndisclosures and the level of detail provided in interview. Hershkouitz ef al.\n(2oo6) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed sexual abuse\nand those who did not (but about whom there was ‘substantial’ reason to\nbelieve that they had been abused). They found that interviewers behaved\n\n‘They found that differently with the two groups, using different types of prompts with children\ninterviewers behaved who presented as somewhat uncooperative, offered fewer details and gave\ndiff tl ith th more uninformative responses at the beginning of the interview. It would\nPerea wl e appear that interviewers responded to less communicative children by\ntwo groups’ increasing the proportion of closed questions which in turn led to children\nbeing less forthcoming. Lamb ef al, (2oo2) have found that the use of a\nprotocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. ‘tell\nme about that’) as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no\nresponse) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children’s\n\naccounts.\n\nAlthough few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in\ninformal setings (when <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is made to a friend or family member),\nsome qualitative studies have described this process.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in\ndaily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear\nthat many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these\nproceedings to explain the delay in <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in each individual case to enable\nthe courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see\nMcElvaney, 2oo2).

While one might expect that the legal system would be more\nsympathetic to children’s difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be\nthe case that the belief that ‘if the child was really sexually abused, why would\nthey not tell?’, as articulated by Summit (l983), still prevails.\n‘Concerns that In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further\nengagement with the psychological trauma need to be considered.

There is evidence that public awareness\ncampaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that\ninvolves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney,\n2olo, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in\nthe prevention of child abuse.\nMcElvaney ef al.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; latency to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court identified two\nthings that were necessary from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nThe Court used the word “disclose” both as to the identity of the co-conspirators “to\nwhom the government will refer to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay statements it intends\nto offer at trial....” The government, in an atempt to blunt the Order, decided to interpret the\nsame word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions. As to the identity of the co-conspirators,\nthe government disclosed (7.e., identified) three names. When it was parsing the second part of\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR- oooo5962\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005963.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page8of52\nthe Order, houever, the government defined the word “disclose” differently. Disclose, as to the\nactual statements, according to the government, means “produced” at some time in the past or to\nbe produced in the future, perhaps as an oral statement during trial.\n\nOf course, the Court will tell the parties whether it meant two completely different things\nwhen it used the same word, as argued by the government, or whether it intended for the\ngovernment to disclose the statements it intends to offer as co-conspirator statements. To avoid\ndelay over this issue during trial, Ms. Maxwell suggests that she cannot litigate this issue in\nadvance of trial without knouing what statements are being offered under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 8ol(d)(2)(e).\n\nWhat is clear from the government’s response is not that it misunderstood the Order, but\nrather, it continues to disagree with the Order.\n\nB. The Court Has the Authority to Require <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nSecond, doubling doun on its disagreement with the Court, the government claims “‘t is\naware of no such case” in which a court ordered the identification of anticipated co-conspirator\nstatements prior to trial. While the government may not be “aware” of such cases, they certainly,\nand abundantly, exist.\n\nIn United States v. Bocio, lo3 F. Supp. 2d 53l, 534 (N.D.N.Y. 2ooo), the court ordered\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of statements of co-conspirators (Government “must disclose to the defendant\nand make available for inspection, copying, or photographing: any relevant writen or recorded\nstatements ..., or copies thereof, within the possession, custody, or control of the government.”).\n\nIn United States v. Jacobs, 65o F. Supp. 2d l6o, l7l (D. Conn. 2oo9), the court ordered\nco-conspirator statements be produced in advance of trial (“In the case of a co-conspirator who\nthe government plans to call as a witness at trial, that time is nou, and the government is directed\nto produce any relevant statement to defense counsel forthwith.”)\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page9of52\n\nIn United States v. Velez, No. 3:loCRl47 JBA, 2olo WL 4929266, at *7 (D. Conn. Nov.\n3o, 2olo), the defendant moved for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any co-conspirator statements in advance of\ntrial. In response, the government agreed to disclose “well in advance of trial, exactly which of\nthe intercepted telephone calls will be offered as full exhibits at trial and transcripts of those calls\nwill be provided in advance of trial.” Based on that representation the court denied the motion to\nproduce as moot, “without prejudice to renew if the Government fails to comply with its ongoing\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations.” /d.\n\nIn United States v. Smalls, No. CR o6-24o3 RB, 2oo8 WL ll36lo98, at *8—9 (D.N.M.\nJan. 24, 2oo8), the court’s order was very detailed:\n\nThe United States is hereby instructed to:\n\nfile a supplemental brief identifying the summary witness; specifically identifying\n\neach and every coconspirator statement it intends to offer at trial as evidence against\n\nDefendants pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E); and stating hou each proffered\n\nstatement satisfies the requirements of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). Specifically, with respect\n\nto each alleged coconspirator statement, the United States must indicate: a) the\n\nidentity of the coconspirator who made the alleged statement; b) the identity of the\n\nperson or persons to whom the coconspirator statement was made; c) the identity\n\nof the witness who will testify at trial about the coconspirator statement; d) the\n\ncontent of the coconspirator statement; ¢) when the statement was made; f) hou the\n\nstatement is in the course of the alleged conspiracy; and g) hou the statement is in\n\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracy. Additionally, the United States must identify\n\nthe independent evidence it intends to offer in support of admission of the alleged\n\ncoconspirator statements.\nSee also United States v. Brewington, No. l5-CR-ooo73-PAB, 2ol8 WL l4ll274, at *3 (D.\nColo. Mar. 2l, 2ol8) (court required the government to identify and produce all its purported\n8ol(d)(2)(e) statements, in the hundreds; held an evidentiary pre-trial hearing about the\nadmissibility of those statements; and made detailed, statement by statement rulings about\nadmissibility, excluding some and conditionally admiting others); United States v.

Tenn. May l, 2ol2) (government must disclose any statements\nof co-conspirators that it intends to use at trial three weeks prior to the trial).\n\nThere is ample legal authority for the Court to enter the Order to avoid delays and\narguments during trial about what statements are or are not within the lo-year conspiracy alleged\nhere and to prevent surprise and prejudice to the Defendant.\n\nC. There Should Be a Sanction\n\nHedging its bets, the government acknouledges that it “may have misread the court’s\norder” but offers no solution other than the defense is “‘free to litigate the admissibility of any\nsuch statement during trial.” This was the government’s losing argument before the Order.\n\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to sanction a party who violates discovery orders.\nUnited States v. Golyansky, 29l F.3d l245, l249 (loth Cir. 2oo2). In considering a particular\nremedy for a violation, the factors considered are “the reasons why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> was not made, the\nextent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by\na continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59\n(2d Cir. 2ol6) (quoting United States v. Pineros, 532 F.2d 868, 87l (2d Cir. l976)). The\nappropriate remedy is exclusion. Ms. Maxwell has been in jail for approximately l8 months. She\nis trying not to request a continuance of the trial and her lawyers are making every effort to\nreview massive amounts of discovery, interview potential witness, prepare for trial, and juggle a\nmyriad of other responsibilities. The government offers no legitimate excuse for non-\ncompliance. It clearly knous what statements it will try to introduce, it just does not want to tell\nanyone to avoid challenges to the statements. This is willful, not negligent or inadvertent conduct\nwhich should not be sanctioned by the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005967.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Pagel2 of 52\nI. GOVERNMENT CONCEDEDLY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE\n\nBASIS OR REASONING TO ADMIT ANY 4o4(B) EVIDENCE\n\nThe government concedes that (i) it was aware of the December 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (Resp. at 34), (ll) those Amendments required it to give notice of the \"permited\npurpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the [4o4(b)] evidence and the reasoning that\nsupports the purpose\" (id.) (\"Notice\"), and (i) the October ll \"Maxwell Rule 4o4 Leter\"\n(\"Leter\") did not identify the \"permited purpose\" under Rule 4o4(b) for which the government\nseeks (alternative) admission of the two categories of evidence, nor the \"reasoning that supports\nthat evidence.\"! The government wholly fails to explain why it could not comply with these\n\"relatively modest\" new Notice requirements on the timeline ordered by this Court. Nouhere in\nresponse does the government seek leave for an extension to provide the appropriate Notice out\nof time nor justify its \"good cause\" for failure to timely comply with both the Court's Order and\nthe Rule. Instead, they assert that \"any alleged gap in the Government's notice is remediated by\nthis brief.\" Resp. at 39-4o. To quote the government's response to Ms. Maxwell's motion in\nlimine, \"to the extent the [government] takes issue with the rule\" requiring specific pre-trial\nNotice under Rule 4o4(b), \"that complaint is properly directed to the drafters of the Federal\nRules of Evidence.\" Resp. at 6l n.l5.\n\nHaving failed to comply with the Notice requirements of the Rule by the (extended)\nCourt ordered deadline of October ll, the government belatedly argues that the tendered\nevidence is either direct evidence or admissible under Rule 4o4(b). They are wrong on both\nfronts.\n\n! Under the misleading and disingenuous sub-heading (2) (\"The Government has Met and\nExceeded its Notice Obligations\"), the government points only to its (i) October ll <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain\nof the evidence (which gives neither a a proper \"purpose\" or \"reasoning\"), and (i) its Response (the\nrequired \"notice is remediated by this brief\").\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5967\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005976.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 2l of 52\nC. Ms. Maxwell reiterates her request to defer briefing and ruling on the\nadmissibility of TT [EE 2nd exhibits for two\nweeks.\n\nFor the reasons already detailed, the complexity of the issues and the fact that Jy\nHEE «ecently disclosed testimony appears to be of utmost centrality to the government's\ncase, Ms. Maxwell repeats and reiterates her request that she be afforded additional time to\nsubmit a comprehensive motion in /imine concerning the introduction of this testimony and\nexhibits as supposed direct evidence of the charged conspiracy. In that there remains a full\nmonth before opening statements, Ms. Maxwell's fundamental rights to present a defense, to\nhave the effective assistance of counsel, and to a right to confront witnesses and subpoena\nwitnesses to testify in her defense all will be preserved by a small delay on this issue.\n\nI.

This Court should reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are\n\nbased on newly disclosed material, which this Court ordered the government to\nproduce six months ago.\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is on shaky ground (to say the least), the\ngovernment belatedly tries to shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’s proffered expert evidence “that did not\nadhere to the discovery schedule”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5976\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005977.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 22 of 52\n\nIn any case, the newly discovered material doesn’t help the government’s cause. Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5977\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00005984.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 398 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 29 of 52\nalong these lines, that will open the door to other sexual behavior evidence. That\ndoor can remain at least partially closed if Rocchio is not permited to offer her\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony.\n\ne The government still hasn’t explained hou it helps the jury to be told that a victim\nof sexual abuse might make an immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, or she might make an\nincremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, or she might make a delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Resp. at 27-3o.\nAnd when the government says, “[s]exual abuse also impacts the way memory is\nencoded,” that opinion is far outside Rocchio’s expertise because the parties agree\nthat she is not an expert in “the human brain or memory generally.” Resp. at 3o\nn.7.\n\nC. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing.\n\nThere is ample reason for this Court to exclude Rocchio’s testimony outright. At the very\nleast, Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a Daubert hearing. The government implicitly concedes as\nmuch. In a footnote, the government acknouledges the decision in United States v. Raniere, in\nwhich Judge Garaufis ordered a Daubert hearing on the government’s proposed expert testimony\non grooming. 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7-8. In that case, houever, the government withdrew its\nendorsement rather than submit to an Daubert hearing. Resp. at l9 n.3.\n\nJudge Garaufis reasoned that even if other courts in other cases had admited testimony\nabout grooming, “that [did] not make Dr. Hughes’s opinion about grooming techniques reliable\nunder the Daubert standard,” if only because “her extensive academic and clinical experience\nappears focused on victims of sexual abuse, not perpetrators.” See id. at *7. The same is true\nhere, particularly because Rocchio has no experience in, and there is no authority supporting her\nopinions on, grooming-by-proxy. Quite the contrary. The government’s late-breaking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nstates:\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5984\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006044.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page2of6\nPage 2\n\nIt is not clear whether the defendant intends to call one or both of these experts at the\nDaubert hearing on Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. In addition, the Government is only beginning to\nevaluate whether it will interpose Daubert or other objections to these experts. If so, and given\nthat trial is less than one month away, it may be efficient for any Daubert hearing involving Dr.\nRocchio, Dr. Dietz, and possibly Dr. Loftus to occur together.\n\nAccordingly, while the Government is prepared to proceed with a Daubert hearing for Dr.\nRocchio on November lo, 2o2l, the Government respectfully proposes that the Court set the Rule\n4l2 hearing and Daubert hearing for Dr. Rocchio on November l5. To the extent that either Dr.\nDietz and/or Dr. Loftus either testify at the hearing or require Daubert hearings of their oun, such\nhearings can occur that same week.? The Government also proposes to submit any Daubert\nbriefing with regard to Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus by November l2, 2o2l, with defense responses\ndue November l5.\n\nWith respect to the remaining six defense experts, the Government believes more time for\nbriefing is merited for two reasons. First, with the exception of Dr. Hall, the defense’s remaining\nexperts appear to relate to a possible defense case, which likely would not begin until mid-to-late\nDecember. Second, the defendant’s expert notice belies the arguments made by defense in seeking\na late November <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> deadline. Specifically, the defendant requested yesterday as her expert\nnotice deadline, over the Government’s objection and even though the Government provided\nexpert notice in April 2o2l, because she “cannot be expected to hire experts and divine what would\nbe relevant to this case before she is provided the statements by [the Minor Victims], whose\n? Dr. Rocchio is out of the country from November l7 to November 27, so her testimony at any\nDaubert hearing would have to occur before those dates.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006045.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page3of6\nPage 3\n\ncredibility will be the central question for the jury in this case.” (Dkt. No. 29l at l2). From the\nface of the expert notice, it appears that few if any of the defendant’s eight experts would offer\ntestimony whose relevance only became apparent after the Government’s production of Jencks\nAct material and its exhibit list, and it is unlikely that these eight experts were all retained in the\nlast two weeks. The Government should not nou be prejudiced by the defendant’s apparent\ngamesmanship in seeking an unnecessarily cramped <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule. Accordingly, for these\nsix experts, the Government proposes to submit any Daubert briefing on November 23, with\ndefense responses due November 3o.\n\nDefense Position\n\nMs. Maxwell requests that the Court hold the hearing on November lo, 2o2l.\n\nThe Court gave the parties a simple directive which was to confer and pick a date for the\nDaubert and Rule 4l2 hearing, the options being November 5, 9, or lo. Defense counsel atempted\nthis conferral and sent an email to the government stating, in relevant part:\n\n[W]e are free for the Rule 4l2/Daubert hearing on Nov. 9 or lo but have a\npreference for Nov. lo. Please advise what the government’s preference is.\n\nI believe the Court requested that we give our preference about the date of the Rule\n4l2/Daubert hearing in a joint leter to the Court filed on ECF. I think we could\ninclude our positions on the trial length in that leter as well. Please let me knou if\nyou will draft the leter or if you would like the defense to draft it.\n\nThe government’s non-response to this straightforward conferral was: “On the timing\nof the 4l2/Daubert hearing, we’re preparing a draft leter which we’ll send you shortly.”\nInstead of conferring with defense counsel the government at, 7:o7 p.m., sent its two\nsentence non-conferral:\n\nOn the other issue, scheduling the Daubert/4l2 hearing, atached is a draft leter,\nalong with our proposed redactions to your expert notice. Please feel free to insert\nyour position, which we ask that you do by 9:oo.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006046.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page4of6\nPage 4\n\nThe government makes many unfounded accusations including that the timely\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of potential experts is “gamesmanship.” The simple truth here is that avoiding\na direct conferral about a straightforward task such as selecting one of three dates while\ndrafting a three-page rant a few hours before the filing deadline is not mere gamesmanship,\nit is unprofessional gamesmanship. A few observations are in order:\n\nFirst, the reason we are required to hold a Daubert hearing in this case is that the\ngovernment endorsed an expert to talk about subjects that are not widely accepted by\nqualified experts in the field. She has no methodology or studies that support her theories,\nand most of her opinions will be confusing, not help the jury, and do not fit the facts of this\ncase,\n\nSecond, at the government’s request and over the objection of the defense, the Court\naccelerated the Rule 4l2 notice requirement. The defense did not atempt to game this\ndeadline by, for example, complaining about various deficiencies in the delayed roll out of\n35oo material, but instead complied with the Order.\n\nThird, the government, while casting unfounded criticism at defense counsel about the\nneed for the 35oo materials to adequately determine the scope and type of expert testimony,\nfails to advise the Court that Exhibits C and F to the expert disclosures (the list of materials\nreviewed by Drs. Dietz and Hall, respectively), include hundreds of pages of 35oo material.\n\nFourth, no Daubert hearing would be appropriate for Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus or Dr. Hall.\nEach is well qualified, have been accepted by hundreds of courts as experts, and their\nopinions are based on science, not “trauma clinical” pseudoscience.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006047.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4o6 Filed ll/o2/2l Page5of6\nPage 5\n\nFifth, should the Court limit or exclude Dr. Roccio’s opinions, rebutal opinions will\nmost likely be unnecessary.\n\nSixth, the testimony of two of the identified experts, Gerald LaPorte and Jennifer Naso,\nis anticipatory. These forensic document examiners have not yet seen the document that\nmay or may not be produced at trial. They were endorsed out of a spirit of non-\ngamesmanship and in an abundance of caution. Similarly, Robert Kelso will primarily be\ntestifying regarding exhibits that the government recently disclosed and, while likely not\neven an expert opinion, he too was disclosed in an abundance of caution.\n\nSeventh, the government’s proposed schedule is unworkable and will impact selection\nof the jury and the examination of witnesses. One reason to have Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nlitigated before jury selection is that the court may want to inquire of the prospective jurors\nabout “grooming” and, absent a decision, won’t knou if that term is going to be used at\ntrial. If Dr. Rocchio’s grooming opinions are disalloued, the issues regarding Rule 4l2\nwill likely be narroued.\n\nEighth, the defense needs to knou in advance of trial, including opening statements,\nwho is or is not testifying. It would be prejudicial to delay any challenge from the\ngovernment, which may or may not come, until after November 23, to be resolved per the\ngovernment, after opening statements. This is the epitome of gamesmanship because Ms.\nMaxwell will then not be alloued to discuss the testimony in opening.\n\nAnd, finally, the problem here was created by the government.

Neither the Court nor the government welcomes these issues but there is no recourse\nexcept to raise and expose Ms. Maxwell’s inappropriate conditions of confinement and the daily\nproblems that counsel must navigate as the sole advocates for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nAs the trial draws near, we urge the Court to release Ms. Maxwell on the extremely\nrestrictive conditions previously proposed and any additional conditions that the Court deems\nnecessary. There is no factual or legal basis to conclude that no conditions exist to ensure Ms.\nMaxwell’s appearance at trial.\n\nIf Ms. Maxwell is subject to the situation she was forced to endure on April 23, 2o2l, the\nday of her arraignment on the superseding indictment, and again yesterday, there is serious\nconcern that she will be further diminished physically, rendering her unable to withstand the\nrigors of trial might render her incapable of atending her oun trial. On April 23, she was\nawakened at approximately 3:oo a.m., transported to the courthouse, kept in the cellblock from\napproximately 5:oo am to approximately 2:oo p.m., when she was brought to the courtroom\nholding cell. For the entire day she was provided inadequate food and liquid, was not permited\nto retain and review her legal materials and was kept shackled on a metal bench in an excessively\ncold cell. This past Monday, she was awakened at 3:45 a.m. and given a broun bag with two\nsmall apples, two small containers of milk and a cup of cereal but no utensils. She was not\npermited to bring a sweatshirt for warmth. She was transported to the courthouse by two\nmarshals.

Nor was she provided any soap or any disinfectant to wash her hands, in\ndisregard of CDC pandemic protocols. When she caught a few minutes of sleep in the holding\ncell, a marshal jabbed her in the leg to get her atention.® She is already sleep deprived. Should\nshe be subjected to these conditions throughout the trial, it is highly likely that she will not have\nthe stamina to assist in her defense and endure the physical demands of a five-day per week,\nmulti-week court proceedings under the current onerous conditions of her detention.\n\nThe Court and the defense are nou in possession of Jencks Act and Giglio material\nregarding the four accusers which contradict the purported “strength” of the government’s case.\nContrary to the government’s claim — which the Court relied on to repeatedly deny Ms.\nMaxwell’s robust bail applications — there is no independent corroboration for the accusers’\nrespective allegations of abuse. Their respective statements do not corroborate one another and\nfurther demonstrate contamination and collusion from various sources. These disclosures\nsubstantially undermine the strength of the government’s case and underscore the fact that Ms.\nMaxwell should not be detained.\n\n° The male marshal assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail on Monday was inappropriately rough with and\nthreatening to her. After returning Ms. Maxwell to the 4\" floor cell block at 5oo Pearl follouing the court\nappearance at 4o Foley Square, a round trip that required Ms. Maxwell to navigate stairs while in leg\nshackles, the marshal was verbally threatening. His brusque manner was evident in the courtroom. When\nalone with Ms. Maxwell, he stated, in substance: “You think you are special. You are not special.\nRemember you are in custody and the judge doesn’t care about you”’ Ms. Maxwell was placed in a\nholding cell where she remained, unaware whether she would be brought to the U.S. Atorney’s Office on\nthe 5™ Floor of 5oo Pearl Street for a scheduled evidence review of which the marshal was aware. Ms.\nMaxwell does not need to be reminded that she is in custody and that she is being treated worse than most\nother pretrial detainees. It is especially concerning when a pretrial detainee is treated more abusively in\ncourt than in the MDC. The marshal’s vitriol runs counter to the presumption of innocence and reflects\npoorly on the district’s Marshal Service. I made a complaint to the U.S. Marshal and have requested that\nthis particular marshal not be assigned to Ms. Maxwell’s detail in the future. Marshal Ralph Sozio\npromptly responded and informed me that the issue is under investigation.\n\n6\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6o6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006162.jpg": "_ Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4ll Filed ll/o4/2l Pagellof3\nGas U.S. Department of Justice\nN27 United States Atorney\n\n“Seem\n\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Dr. Loftus is one of the nation’s leading experts\non the science of memory. In addition to her experience as an academic and clinical researcher,\nshe has been an expert witness or consultant in hundreds of cases.

She will describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6l8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006184.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 4l8-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page4ofl4\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

A at 3 (citing id.)). .\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz’s opinion is intended to apply to the context of this case, the defense\nhas clearly not to date carried the burden of establishing that the methods that led Dr. Dietz to offer\nthis uncited and implausible opinion are subject to peer review and publication, have atained\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6239\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006240.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 Filed ll/o8/2l Page 29 of 4l\nwidespread or general acceptance, or are otherwise reliable.

Accordingly, unless the defense meets its burden of affirmatively establishing that this\nopinion, as applied to the context of this case, meets the Daubert reliability standard, it should be\nprecluded. See, e.g., P.S. ex rel. Nelson v. The Farm, Inc., 658 F. Supp. 2d l28l, l288 (D. Kan.\n2oo9) (excluding as unreliable an expert’s opinion that children typically report abuse in response\nto direct questioning without holding hearing). Should the defense come forward with some\nevidence of reliability in its response papers, the Government would respectfully request an\nopportunity to reply or, in the alternative, a Daubert hearing to probe the issue.\n\nTo the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to the context of this case, the defendant\nhas not established the reliability of these opinions, which should be precluded or, at a minimum,\nexplored at a hearing. And to the extent Dr. Dietz seeks to apply his opinions to other contexts,\nthey are irrelevant.”\n\nI. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED EXPERT TESTIMONY OF\n\nDR. ELIZABETH LOFTUS SHOULD BE PRECLUDED\n\nA. Background\n\nThe defense seeks to offer expert opinions of Dr. Loftus on “the workings of human\nmemory.” (Ex. A at l). Specifically, the defense seeks to offer testimony from Dr. Loftus\nregarding:\n\nl. “[H]ou memory fades and weakens over time.”\n\n’ The Government understands that Dr. Dietz is not planning on atending the November lo, 2o2l\nDaubert hearing of Dr. Rocchio, and the Government has not to date received any Rule 26.2\ndisclosures from Dr. Dietz, or even a complete bibliography of the sources cited in his <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nThe Government respectfully requests that, should a hearing be scheduled on the reliability of Dr.\nDietz’s opinions, that hearing be held after the defense’s response to this motion and after all\nnecessary Rule 26.2 disclosures are made.\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo624o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 36 of 4l\nSchool of Social Ecology, htps://faculty.sites.uci.edu/eloftus/ (“[Dr. Loftus’s] experiments reveal\nhou memories can be changed by things that we are told.”). Such research may thus be\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\nTo the extent that the Court believes that the defense may have carried its burden of\nestablishing the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on false memory formation, the Government\nrespectfully requests a Daubert hearing to test the reliability of these opinions.”\n\nEven if any such opinions are reliable, houever, they should not be admited absent an\naffirmative shouing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 advisory commitee n. (stating\nthat “generalized” expert testimony must “‘fit’ the facts of the case”). For example, testimony\nabout the ways in which “false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event\ninformation and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” is irrelevant to this case. At that\nlevel of generality, it has no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is no evidence that\nwhatever “occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about which Dr. Loftus intends to testify\nhappened to any witness in this case, much less in a manner that reliably affects memory or would\nbe probative to the jury. Thus, as with Dr. Dietz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus seeks to offer\non false memory formation should be limited to those as to which there is a clear evidentiary\npredicate establishing their “fit” to the case.\n\nAs with Dr. Dietz, see footnote 9, supra, if a hearing is necessary, the Government similarly\nrequests that it be conducted after receiving the defense response and after all necessary Rule 26.2\ndisclosures have been made.\na2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424 _ Filed ll/o8/2l Page 4o of 4l\ndoes not share the defense’s view of the law, to the extent the Court accepts that view, Dr. Loftus\nand Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\nThis point is valid in a number of respects, but three in particular bear noting. First, the\ndefense criticizes Dr. Rocchio in the strongest terms for opining about principles that “have no\nassociated error rate.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l, 7, 8, l2, l5; see Ex. A at 3-4). Neither Dr. Loftus nor\nDr. Dietz identify an error rate for a single one of their opinions, much less all of them. Second,\nthe defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions cannot be reliably applied by a jury because she\ndescribes phenomena that occur reliably in her practice and the literature, but she does not specify\nhou often. (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8, lo, l6 (“Rocchio claims grooming ‘often’ or ‘frequently occurs’\nwithout providing the jury any explanation of hou to decide whether grooming actually occurred\nin this case.”’)). The same could be said for Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz. (See Ex. A at l (“[Dr. Loftus]\nwill describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be described with confidence,\ndetail, and emotion, just like true memories.” (emphasis added)); id. at 7 (“False allegations of\nsexual assault do occur....”)). Third, the defense argues that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “memory\nand <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic and abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma,” is “so generic as to be meaningless.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7).\nThat opinion is no more generic than the opinion that false memories can be “created as a result of\npost-event information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like.” (Ex. A at 2).\n\nIn the Government’s view, the defense’s view in its Daubert motion is unnecessarily\ncramped, and each expert opinion’s reliability can be tested individually. But given the defense’s\nview of Daubert and its progeny, if Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are excluded based on the defense’s\narguments, Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz should be excluded as well.\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo625l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006254.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page2ofl5\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nDr. Loftus is the Distinguished Professor of Psychological Science and Law at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine School of Law. Dr. Loftus is one of the nation’s leading experts\non the science of memory. In addition to her experience as an academic and clinical researcher,\nshe has been an expert witness or consultant in hundreds of cases. Her extensive experience and\ncredentials are recited in her curriculum vitae. Exhibit A.\n\nIt is expected that Dr. Loftus, a psychologist who specializes in the study of memory, will\nfocus on the memory aspects of this case. Based on her education, training, experience, and\nresearch, her testimony will concern the workings of human memory, the effects of suggestion\non memory, the mechanism of creation of false memories, the characteristics of false memories,\nhou memory fades and weakens over time, and hou memory becomes more vulnerable to\ncontamination. She will describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6254\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006257.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 424-l Filed ll/o8/2l Page5ofl5\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “[T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo63o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006328.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 429 Filed ll/o9/2l Page l of 2\n2l2-243-lloo * Main 225 Broadway, Suite 7l5\n9l7-9l2-9698 * Cell New York, NY looo7\n888-587-4737 ° Fax besternhein@mac.com\n\nNovember 9, 2o2l\nHonorable Alison J.

Ghislaine Maxwell\nS2 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe government’s opposition to releasing Ghislaine Maxwell from pretrial detention\n(Dkt. 423) is a long-winded regurgitation of prior writings and rulings and underscores its\ndetermination to ignore the presumption of innocence and punish Ms. Maxwell pretrial for her\nassociation with Jeffrey Epstein. The indictment against her federalizes a New York State B\nmisdemeanor which carries a maximum penalty of 9o days. Ms. Maxwell, who awaits trial, has\nserved that five times over. Ms. Maxwell is not, and has never been, a flight risk. At every\nopportunity, Ms. Maxwell has vigorously asserted her innocence and her eagerness to face these\nunsubstantiated charges in court. She should be alloued to do so outside of the confines of the\nMDC, where her conditions of confinement significantly impede her ability to prepare for trial,\nnegatively impact her health, and compromise her stamina to endure the rigors of trial.\n\nThe Court nou has the 35oo material and Giglio material which seriously undermine the\nstrength of the government’s case and underscore the lack of corroboration, facts which the\ngovernment cannot and does not even atempt to refute. Rather, the government urges the Court\nto rely on prior rulings that were based on government conjecture that is not substantiated by\nrecent disclosures. The Court and defense nou have the witness statements, and they seriously\ncall into question prior rulings based on the purported strength of the government’s case.\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6328\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006343.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page2ofll\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nThe Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7). To determine whether an\nexpert’s method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme\nCourt in Daubert, including whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been\nsubjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method’s operation, and\nwhether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d\n259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S. at 593-94).\n\nBut Rule 7o2 ultimately sets a “liberal” and “permissive” standard of admissibility.\nNimely v.

In particular, not every expert\nadmissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with “the exactness of hard\nscience methodologies.” E.E.O.C. v.

Discussion\n\nAs a preliminary mater, the Defense argues that the additional materials filed by the\nGovernment in support of Dr. Rocchio’s expertise should be excluded as failing to comply with\nthe Court’s order that the Government make all expert witness disclosures by April 23, 2o2l.\nDkt. No. 25o. But that Order, made pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(a)(l)(G),\nrequired only that the Government provide an adequate summary of the intended topics and\nopinions of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, which the Government did here in a timely manner. See\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6343\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006344.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page3ofll\nKidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 262. The Defense cites only one case, United States v. Lewis, which\ninvolved the distinct situation where a district court excluded expert testimony because the notice\nitself was untimely. 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir. 2o2o). The Court concludes that the\nGovernment’s supplemental materials in further response to the Defense’s motion are timely and\nmay be considered in resolving the Daubert motion.\n\nTurning to the proffered expert opinions, as articulated in the Government’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nand at the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio would offer five expert opinions. First, that perpetrators\nof sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part\nof a strategic patern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse.\nSecond, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their\nexperience as abuse and so prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic\nand psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate\nsexual abuse of minors. And fifth, that nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse and that memory can be affected by a variety of factors,\nincluding the effects of trauma.\n\nThe Defense does not contest that Dr. Rocchio has the qualifications to express opinions\non these subjects. Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the\nAlpert Medical School of Broun University. She has more than two decades of experience\ntreating hundreds of victims of trauma, many of which were minor victims of sexual abuse. She\nhas published peer-reviewed articles on trauma and sexual abuse and has given numerous talks in\naddition to her teaching. Given these papers, and her credible and extensive hearing testimony,\nthe Court therefore finds Dr. Rocchio qualified as an expert.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006349.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 435 Filed ll/ll/2l Page8oflil\nHoldings, Inc., No. l6-CV-2242 (VEC), 2o2o WL l5o3452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

Castillo, 924 F.2d l227, l232 (2d Cir. l99l))). Dr.\nRocchio’s first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding hou a minor may be\nenticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions\nmay also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with\nJeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio’s fourth\nopinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or\ninducement.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on\nanticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if\nthe Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion\nmay become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in\nfully disclosing sexual abuse. At the Daubert hearing, the Defense stated that they intended to\npursue both lines of impeachment at trial. Nov. lo Tr. at l56-57. The Court therefore finds\nthese elements of Dr. Rocchio’s testimony relevant to maters the Defense intends to put in issue\nduring anticipated cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the\nother relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding\nconcepts that require expert knouledge without directing the jury to reach any conclusion as to a\nwitness’s credibility.

The Government does not assume that the\nmainstream press would reveal the identity of a victim against her wishes, particularly if the victim\nis testifying under Court-ordered protections to preserve her anonymity. Furthermore, the\nGovernment’s understanding from conferring with prosecutors in similar cases is that the\nmainstream press did not, in fact, reveal the identities of victims who testified under court-ordered\nprotections.

The defendant knous who the Minor Victims\nand other witnesses are and has conducted a fulsome investigation, as shoun by the defendant’s\nbrief in opposition.

See Bouen, 799\nF.2d at 6l3 (referring simply to a “common trial tactic of defense lawyers”).\n\nThis case exemplifies the point. The defense would like to (inaccurately) argue that the\nNew York investigation was opened in response to the non-prosecution agreement entered\nbetween the USAO-SDFL and Epstein (the “NPA”), that the Government “scramble[d]” to\ninvestigate the defendant after Epstein’s death, and that “public pressure” led to a sloppy\ninvestigation. (Def. Opp. at 34). To do this, the defense would like to elicit information about the\nprocess by which the Government opened the New York investigation, media coverage, statements\nby the former Atorney General, Epstein’s death, and a variety of other topics. (/d. at 33-35).\nPresumably, under its view, the defense could introduce other categories of evidence that relate in\nany way to the thoroughness or good faith of the investigation. None of that has anything to do\nwith the defendant’s guilt or innocence.\n\nWith respect to Rule 4o3, it is not enough for the defense to say that jurors can understand\nthat there were two separate investigations. (See id. at 35). The defense, as the proponent of this\nalleged evidence, has the burden to establish that the probative weight outweighs any prejudice.\nThey cannot do so.

In support of this request, Ms. Maxwell states:\n\nRELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn multiple occasions Ms. Maxwell requested <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identity of any alleged\nco-conspirators in this case along with any statements made by those individuals that the\ngovernment intends to offer into evidence at trial under Federal Rule of Evidence 8ol(d)(2)(E).\nThe Court, on September 3, 2o2l, dismissed the government’s arguments against <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nnoting that the concern raised by the government about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “does not outweigh the risk of\nsurprise to the Defendant in this case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues\nin advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay” Dkt. 335 at 3. The Order was explicit\nregarding what the government was required to do: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the government identified three purported co-conspirators for\npurposes of trial: Jeffrey Epstein, [x | Thc\ngovernment, houever, failed and refused to disclose “a// (or any) co-conspirator statements it\nintends to introduce at trial....” Instead, the government, circumventing the plain meaning of the\nCourt’s Order, offered that “[t]he Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which\n\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo656o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006561.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page5ofl2\nit intends to offer at trial ... in the Government’s production today or in its previous\nproductions.” And, circumnavigating this Court’s Order with Magellan-like skill, promised that,\nas the government “continues to prepare for trial” it will produce any additional co-conspirator\nstatements “in connection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” See, Ex.\nl.\nI. The Government Failed to Identify Any Purported Co-Conspirator\n\nStatements\n\nFor a statement to fall within the definition of Fed.R.Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E), “a court must\nfind (l) that there was a conspiracy, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party\nagainst whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the\ncourse of and (b) in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll96\n(2d Cir. l993). These conditions precedent are “[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the\nadmissibility of evidence” as referenced in Fed. R. Evid. lo4(a), and must be proven by a\npreponderance of the evidence. United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d l38o, l386 (2d Cir. l988).\n\nThe Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether\nthe 8ol(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. Houever, because “these hearsay statements are\npresumptively unreliable,” United States v. Tellier, 83 F.3d 578, 58o (2d Cir. l996), there must\nbe independent corroborating evidence of the existence of the conspiracy and the participation\ntherein of the declarant and the defendant. Jd.\n\nII. Ongoing Document Dumps Containing Thousands of Statements Do Not\n\nSatisfy the Court’s Order to Disclose\n\nThe government neither objected to Ms. Maxwell's request for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> nor the Court’s\nOrder requiring <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> at the same time. See Dkt. 3l7 at l2, n.l (citing Dkt. 29l and Dkt.\n293).

These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements\nspanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of\nthe emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either\nconspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any\nstatement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any\natempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some\nother statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.\nMaxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,\nidentify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,\nlitigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was\nintended to avoid.\n\nGiven the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the\nCourt ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, houever, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by\natempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of\nthe Order mandating <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the\ngovernment has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”\nproduced or to be produced in the case.\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6562\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006563.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 7 ofl2\nIll. The Failure to Disclose Prevents Defense Cross Examination at Trial and\n\nFacilitates the Presentation of False Testimony\n\nNone of the identified purported coconspirators are available to testify at trial. Jeffrey\nEpstein is dead, and neither i have been granted immunity for\ntheir trial testimony. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot cross-examine any identified\ncoconspirator about whether he or she made any yet-to-be atributed statement. The\ngovernment’s failure to disclose creates a real danger that during trial one or more of the alleged\naccusers will, for the first time, offer some alleged 8ol(d)(2)(E) statement atempting to\ninculpate Ms. Maxwell. Thus, it is entirely possible that any one of the accusers could be asked,\nfor example,\n\nGovernment Lawyer: Why did you go to the house?\n\nWitness/Accuser: Because [insert coconspirator] said that Maxwell said [insert\n\nexpedient non-disclosed [statement]].\n\nThis is an invitation to manufacture evidence which Ms. Maxwell cannot cross examine.\n\nIn addition, the failure to disclose implicates many of the issues raised in Ms. Maxwell’s\npreviously filed motions. The allegations are decades old, and Ms. Maxwell raised concerns\nabout lack of memory and available witnesses in her Motion to Dismiss for Pre-Indictment\nDelay, Dkt. l38. It has been difficult to track doun and interview relevant percipient witnesses to\nthe alleged events. The failure of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of critical alleged coconspirator statements makes it\nimpossible to prepare a defense.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6563\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006565.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44l Filed ll/l2/2l Page9ofl2\nThe Court emphasized that the defendant had acted willfully and in bad faith in not disclosing\nthe witness until the second day of trial after the prosecution's primary witness had testified. See\nid. at 4l6-l7.

Campagnuolo,\n592 F.2d 852, 858 (Sth Cir. l979) (no abuse of discretion where, as here, a district judge for\nprophylactic purposes suppresses evidence that, under a valid discovery order, the government\nshould have disclosed earlier, even if the nondisclosure did not prejudice the defendants); United\nStates v.

The government did not agree\nwith the Order and sought reconsideration. The Court considered the government’s belated\nrequest and rejected the government’s “concern” that somehou its evidence would be limited at\ntrial. Of course, the government could have made a good faith effort to comply with the Order\nand, if some other statement came to the government’s atention before or during trial it could\nhave, in good faith, requested permission to supplement its proof.

EXHIBIT l. Although the\ngovernment says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the\ngovernment’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at l-3.\n\nInstead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in\ntraumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “writen,\npresented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at\nl-2.\n\nAccording to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the follouing topics:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of\n\nsexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is\n\ndeveloped over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are\n\noften subject to a strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\n\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their abuser. The\n\nrelationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware that what\n\nthey are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims therefore\n\nmay not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not\n\nrecognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation\n\nand abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in\n\nlong-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in\n\nthe context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the\n\nsexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,\n\nincremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\n\na variety of reasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events\n\nis impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the\n\ntrauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the\n3 Daubert v. Merrell Dou Phar., Inc., 5o9 U.S. 579, 595 (l993).\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6593\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006599.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel3 of 24\n“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain hou these conclusions were\nreached, what testing was involved, what data she considered, or hou her conclusions can be\nverified.\n\nThis is exactly why the Court in United States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony\nin a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal\nsexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who\nprefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their\ntrust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many\nvalid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the\ndelayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated\nwith false allegations.” 7oo F. Supp. 2d. at l48. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,\nexplaining:\n\nNouhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or\n\ncomparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? Hou many is “many”?\n\nHou few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral\n\ngeneralizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective\n\nsense? Nouhere do I see any discussion of false positives. Hou many cases has\n\nLanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes\n\nnevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes\n\nturns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that\n\nnumber may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he\n\nhas investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned\n\nout to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?\n\nFor example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually\n\nconsists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s\n\nchild molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he\n\nmust therefore not have been grooming a child?\n\nId. at l48-49 (citations and footnote omited). This Court should apply the teachings of Raymond\nto this case.\n\nFinally, Rocchio is a treatment provider of alleged victims of trauma, including victims\nof sexual assault. But she has no experience treating or evaluating alleged perpetrators of sexual\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6599\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006603.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel7 of 24\nB. Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged\nperpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that\nwhat they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nRocchio’s second opinion—that the relationship of trust and atachment between an\nalleged perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—has several flaws that render it inadmissible.\n\nFirst, the opinion is unreliable, because it is, in reality, an opinion about grooming\ndisguised as an opinion about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. In Rocchio’s view, alleged victims delay or fail\nto disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But because Rocchio’s proposed\ngrooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all\nthe reasons given above, supra Part l.a-l.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, not helpful to the\ntrier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.\n\nTo reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on her personal experience as a treatment\nprovider. She assumes her clients are telling the truth, and her clients are a self-selected group of\nalleged victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate for her conclusions, nor can she say hou\nrepresentative her patients are of those who suffer sexual abuse. See E.E.o.C., 2olo WL\n346637o, at *l4 (exclusion of an expert is required where the expert makes “no effort to ensure\nthat the materials he reviewed were representative”). Her conclusions cannot be tested or\nverified, and they are “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.” Gonyer, 2ol2\nWL 3o43o2o, at *2.\n\nSecond, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. So her view\nof the “relationship of trust and atachment between an alleged perpetrator and alleged victim” is\nentirely one-sided. See Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *2-3. The second opinion Rocchio\nproposes to offer is outside her expertise.\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006606.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2o of 24\nE. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that\nmemory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a\nnumber of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma\n\nThere are several problems with Rocchio’s proposed testimony that “nondisclosure,\nincremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of\nreasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number\nof factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma.”\n\nThe first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, or late\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>—is unreliable because the alleged connection “between child sexual abuse and a\nfailure to report . . . is not a testable hypothesis.” Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4. Rocchio\noffers no data or analyses to support her conclusion, EX. l, and she formed her subjective\nopinion based entirely on her treatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are\ntelling the truth. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her\nclinical patients tell her they have been subjected to sexual abuse, she unequivocally believes\nthem.”). “There is also no knoun or identified rate of error to [Rocchio’s] conclusion, nor is\nthere a reliable method or a series of factors guiding [Rocchio’s] conclusion as to whether an\nindividual victim is fabricating [her] abuse or has simply delayed reporting such abuse.” See id.\nAnd because Rocchio’s experience is apparently “limited to providing therapy for those child\nvictims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position “reliably opine as to the\ncharacteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” See id. Rocchio’s\ntestimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful way.” /d. Her opinions\nare unreliable and inadmissible.\n\nRocchio’s testimony also “will [not] help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\ndetermine a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 7o2(a). Rocchio’s opinions on <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are so generic\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo66o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006607.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 24\n\nas to explain whatever a victim might do. Rocchio says that nondisclosure, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\nand incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are ““common” and therefore consistent with being sexually abused.\nBut since Rocchio does not contend that nondisclosure, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and incremental\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are the inevitable consequence of sexual abuse, then it’s necessarily also true that\nnondisclosure, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are inconsistent with being\nsexually abused. Rocchio’s testimony, therefore, adds nothing to the case, because the jury has\nno means to apply her opinions to the evidence and to determine whether yg\n—CSSCSCSCSCies\nSS\n\nRocchio’s opinions about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are not helpful to the jury, and they will serve only\nto prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 4o3. While the government will surely contend that\nRocchio will not opine as to the truthfulness of any of the alleged victims in this case, the\npractical effect of Rocchio’s opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are\ncommon among victims of sexual abuse” is to suggest to the jury that those who delayed\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are telling the truth about the abuse they suffered. Schneider, 2olo WL 3734o55, at\n*6.° Because a witness’s credibility is solely within the province of the jury to determine,\nhouever, Federal Rule of Evidence 7o4(b) bars testimony that a witness is testifying truthfully.\nMoreover, Rocchio’s testimony serves to bolster the credibility of the victims, and such\nbolstering is impermissible. See United States v. Charley, l89 F.3d l25l, l267 (loth Cir. l999)\n(“In general, expert testimony which does nothing but vouch for the credibility of another\n> Of course, the court should not expect Rocchio to disavou the converse of this proposition—\nthat those who immediately disclose alleged abuse are lying.

Rocchio’s opinions on <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> also contravene Rule 4o3 because they\nsuggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than\nwith fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2olo WL\n3734o55, at *6.\n\nThat leaves the second half of Rocchio’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> opinion: that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances\nsurrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a mater of\ncommon sense—hou could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?\nMoreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion\nabout when, why, and hou alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers\nfrom all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating\nher opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her\nopinion is based on the self-reports of her oun clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.\n\nII. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing\n\nFor all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At\n\nthe very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a\nDaubert hearing.\n\nDated: October l8, 2o2l\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo66o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006612.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 443-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page2of4\noa U.S. Department of Justice\nee” United States Atorney\nSouthern District of New York\nThe Silvio J.

Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since\nearning her Ph.D. in l995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School\nof Broun University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since\nshe entered private practice in l998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence.

She has writen, presented, and taught about the assessment and\ntreatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2ol4, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review\nboard of the APA journal 7rauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is\na member of the APA Ethics Commitee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio’s curriculum vitae is being\nproduced to you today bearing Bates number 35o2-oo6.!\n\nDr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience,\nand research to the follouing: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time,\nrather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the\nvictims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment\nwith their abuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from being aware\nthat what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims therefore may\nnot identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological\nconsequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that\nnondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for\na variety of reasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted\nby a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not\nevaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony regarding any specific victim.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological\ntrauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio’s\nextensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in\nchildhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological\nevaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is\nproducing notes from the Government’s interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well.\n\nIl. Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice\n\nIn light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal\nnotice under Rule l6(b)(l)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert\nwitness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a writen summary of any testimony that\nthe defendant intends to use under Rules 7o2, 7o3, or 7o5 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as\nwell as the witness’s qualifications.\n\n' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal\nand state litigation.

Pascarella, 84 F.3d 6l, 69 (2d Cir. l996)). The\ninclusionary approach, houever, does not permit the government “to offer, carte blanche, any\nprior act of the defendant in the same category of [activity].” McCallum, 584 F.3d at 475\n(quoting United States v. Garcia, 29l F.3d l27, l37 (2d Cir. 2oo2)). If other act evidence is\noffered for the purpose of establishing the defendant’s knouledge or intent, the government must\n“identify a similarity or connection between the two acts that makes the prior act relevant to\nestablishing knouledge of the current act.” /d. (quoting Garcia, 29l F.3d at l37).\n\nThe government has argued that the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 is admissible under\nRule 4o4(b) to prove Ms. Maxwell’s knouledge, intent, and modus operandi. See Gov’t Mem.\nin Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 2o4) at l67. This argument is unavailing. Accuser-3’s\nevidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell knew of Epstein’s “atraction to minor\ngirls” and knew that Epstein used massage to initiate sexual contact “with minor girls” because\nAccuser-3 was not a minor when the alleged sex acts took place. /d. For the same reason,\nAccuser-3’s evidence could not possibly be proof that Ms. Maxwell “intended for minor girls to\nengage in sex acts with Epstein.” Jd.\n\n3 As noted in Ms. Maxwell’s Motion in Limine to Exclude the Government’s Rule 4o4(b) Evidence, the government\ndid not give proper 4o4(b) notice with respect to any of its proposed 4o4(b) evidence, which includes Accuser-3’s\nevidence. Nevertheless, we respond on the merits to the admissibility of Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 4o4(b) in\nthe event the Court determines that the government’s additional disclosures concerning Accuser-3 in its\nMemorandum in Opposition to Defendant’s Pretrial Motions are sufficient to satisfy its notice obligations under\nRule 4o4(b).

Nor can the government circumvent the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and discovery requirements of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure and bypass this Court’s gatekeeping role under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 7o2 by offering what is, in fact, expert opinion from law enforcement officers who are\npurportedly only testifying as lay witnesses.\n\nMs. Maxwell files this motion to limit the government’s expert witnesses to those who\nwere properly disclosed and endorsed as experts, and to prevent the government from lessening\nits burden of proof by relying on the supposed expert opinions of undisclosed and unqualified\nlaw enforcement officers.\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe government has endorsed and disclosed only two witnesses who may offer expert\n\nopinion testimony under Rule of Evidence 7o2—Dr. Lisa Rocchio and Steven Flately.\n]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6687\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006689.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 448 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6oflo\n\nIn turn, if a prosecution witness offers expert opinion testimony under Rule 7o2, Federal\nRule of Criminal Procedure l6(l)(G) requires the government to make significant and\nsubstantive pretrial disclosures. The government must disclose “a writen summary of any\ntestimony that the government intends to use . . . during its case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim.\nP. l6(l)(G). The summary “must [also] describe the witness’s opinions, the bases and reasons\nfor those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Id.\n\nThe government has not endorsed yy as cxpert witnesses\nunder Rule 7o2 or made any pretrial disclosures for these witnesses under Rule l6(l)(g).\nAccordingly, none of these witnesses can offer expert opinion testimony at trial. That means\nthese witnesses should not be permited to offer testimony on any of the follouing subjects:\n\ne Any expert “overview” testimony about the case, its origins, and the investigation.\n\nE.g., United States v. Brooks, 736 F.3d 92l, 93o-3l (loth Cir. 2ol3) (overview\ntestimony can include improper expert opinion testimony).'\n\n' Overview testimony is susceptible to abuse because it strays\n\ninto maters that are reserved for the jury, such as opinions about a defendant’s guilt\n\nor a witness’s credibility. An overview witness, for example, might express\n\nopinions about the defendant’s truthfulness at certain times or [her] likelihood of\n\nbeing involved in a scheme or crime, thus usurping the jury’s role in making fact\n\nfindings based on the credibility and demeanor of witnesses with personal\n\nknouledge. Other potential problems include the government’s ability (l) to spin\n\nthe evidence in its favor before it is admited (assuming it is ever admited), (2) to\n\ngive its official imprimatur to certain evidence, and (3) to allou its witnesses\n\n(usually law enforcement) to testify on maters about which they have no personal\n\nknouledge or that are based on hearsay.\nBrooks, 736 F.3d at 93o.\n\n[S]uch testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be\n\ninfluenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not\n\nin evidence. There is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than\n\nwhat the overview witness assumed; objections could be sustained or the witness\n\ncould change his or her story.

The Court Should Admit the Testimony of Dr. Lisa Rocchio\n\nThe Government intends to call Dr. Lisa Rocchio as an expert witness. Dr. Rocchio is the\nPresident-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology at the American Psychological Association.\nShe is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School of Broun University, and she\nhas practiced psychology for approximately 25 years, specializing in treating patients with trauma,\nincluding sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. Dr. Rocchio has treated hundreds of\nvictims of trauma, including many victims of child sexual abuse, and she has writen, presented,\nand taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma. She has also received continuing\neducation on trauma and the treatment of trauma in a clinical seting. (See generally Curriculum\nVitae, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 2).\n\nOn April 23, 2o2l, the Government timely notified the defendant of its intent to call Dr.\nRocchio in its case-in-chief. As the notice explains, Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on\nher relevant education, training, experience, and research, and offer the follouing opinions:\n\nIndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by\nperpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently\noccurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in the context of\nan established relationship that is developed over time, rather than\nthrough the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to\na strategic patern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take\na variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to\nabuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and\natachment with their abuser. The relationship of trust and\natachment can prevent victims from being aware that what they are\nexperiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims\ntherefore may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is\nongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until\nadulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the\nlikelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006714.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page6of84\ntraumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it\noccurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other\nindividuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is\nalso expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\nand secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety\nof reasons, and that memory and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive\nevents is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated\nany of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s\ntestimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).\n\nThere is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established\nscientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admited in cases involving sexual\nabuse. This Court should do the same.\n\nA. Applicable Law\n\nDistrict courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert\ntestimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. l7 Civ. 836l (AJN), 2o2o WL 7o28954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. 3o, 2o2o) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2ol7)). Although\nthe proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a\npreponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d l49, l6l (2d Cir.\n2o2o), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,\nNo. l6 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2o2o WL 6o48l53, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l3, 2o2o) (quoting Borawick\nv. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 6lo (2d Cir. l995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 7o2,\nreflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the\ntraditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dou Pharms., Inc., 5o9 U.S.\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006719.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page ll of 84\nUnited States v. Raniere, No. l8 Cr. 2o4 (NGG), 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. May 22,\n2ol9).\n\nInstead, the defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are unreliable, irrelevant, or\nprejudicial. To the contrary, and as explained in greater detail belou, each of the Dr. Rocchio’s\nfive challenged opinions is well supported and would aid the jury in understanding the evidence\nat trial. The Court should permit Dr. Rocchio to testify.\n\nl. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinions on Coercion and Atachment are Admissible\n\na. Reliability\n\nAs described in the expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify about the role that trust and\n\natachment play in relationships between a victim and an abuser:\n\nSexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of\n\nmanipulation or coercion in the context of an _ established\n\nrelationship that is developed over time, rather than through the use\n\nof forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic patern\n\nof behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms\n\nand function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure\n\nthe nature of the abuse, and to build trust and atachment with their\n\nabuser. The relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims\n\nfrom being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can\n\nprevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. | at 2). Dr. Rocchio will opine that victims are often abused in\nthe context of a coercive and manipulative relationship which develops over time through the\nbuilding of victims’ trust and atachment. One aspect of this relationship is “often called\ngrooming.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). Houever, the concepts of atachment and coercion go beyond\ngrooming, and encompass both the trust-building aspect of the relationship and the ways in which\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo67l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006727.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page l9 of 84\nevidence, to evaluate what weight to give it. But that does not change whether Dr. Rocchio’s\nopinions are squarely within the mainstream of psychological practice.\n\nThe defendant next argues that Dr. Rocchio’s patients are “self-selected,” and she has not\nestablished the “representativeness of her patients as typical victims of so-called grooming\nbehavior.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7). But the defendant makes no argument that the minor victims in this\ncase are distinctive in some way such that general principles of psychology may diverge as to\nthem. And in any event, that argument is for the jury to evaluate, and not a basis to preclude Dr.\nRocchio’s testimony. See Feb. 25, 2o2o Tr. at 36:l3-37:5, United States v. Randall, l9 Cr. l3l\n(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 335 (rejecting a defense atempt to distinguish between native-born\nand domestic-born women because, “while a court is to be a gatekeeper as to reliability so as to\nkeep ‘junk science’ away from juries, the Court must not overstep that role. Whether or not the\nCourt would be persuaded that adult native-born women can be subject to trauma bonding, the\nCourt is not to arrogate to itself that judgment.’’)\n\nFinally, the defendant argues that Dr. Rocchio has no experience treating perpetrators of\nsexual assault, so she cannot testify as to the psychology of perpetrators and their “so-called\n‘grooming’ techniques.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7-8). Many of the opinions the defendant challenges\nconcern the experiences of victims, not perpetrators. Dr. Rocchio will testify about the patern to\nwhich “minor victims are often subject,” which makes “victims vulnerable to abuse,” and builds\ntheir “trust and atachment with their abuser.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2 (emphasis\nadded)). Grooming creates in the victims “a relationship of trust and atachment” that “can prevent\nvictims from being aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. (dd.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6727\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006731.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 23 of 84\nthey were in this case will depend on the other evidence. That is not a prejudicial simplification—\nthat is the trial.\n\nThere is nothing unreliable, irrelevant, or unusual about Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on coercion\nand atachment. Drawing on her decades of clinical experience and her familiarity with the\nrelevant literature, Dr. Rocchio will give opinion testimony that will help the jury understand\nwitness testimony. That is all Rule 7o2’s gatekeeping requirements demand.\n\n2. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on the Relationship Between Trust and Victim Awareness\n\nof Their Abuse is Admissible\n\nAt trial, the Government intends to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about hou victims\nprocess their abuse and hou that can prevent or delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. As the Government set forth in\nits expert notice, Dr. Rocchio will testify that:\n\nThe relationship of trust and atachment can prevent victims from\n\nbeing aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Minor victims therefore may not identify themselves as\n\nvictims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the\n\nconsequences of that abuse until adulthood.\n(Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). This opinion is part and parcel of Dr. Rocchio’s other opinions about the\nrelationship between atachment and coercion. Specifically, and as noted above, victims develop\nrelationships of trust and atachment with their abusers that leave victims vulnerable to coercion.\nThis opinion adds that, as part of this relationship, victims may not recognize that they are\nexperiencing abuse and may not see themselves as victims while they are in this relationship, and\ntherefore may not disclose their abuse or recognize the consequences of their abuse until later in\nlife. As the defense correctly observes, this opinion is intertwined with Dr. Rocchio’s opinions\nabout coercion and atachment. (Def. Mo. 3 at l2). Just as those are reliable, so is this one.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR- oooo673l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006736.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 28 of 84\npimp to arrange sex acts for third parties. See, e.g., Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. l7, 2ol9\nTr. at 27:l-l2, United States v. Dupigny, No. l8 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. l98. Second,\nin any event, the Government did not provide expert notice on “grooming by proxy.” Dr. Rocchio\nwill give an opinion on grooming, and she will discuss hou “[t]he presence of other individuals\ncan facilitate the sexual abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2). The former is\na reliable opinion, as explained above, and the defendant does not challenge the reliability of the\nlater opinion. (See Def. Mot. 3 at l4). Third, trial testimony will shou that the defendant (l) in\nfact participated in sexual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and (3)\nconspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors. None of that involves\n“srooming by proxy.”\n\n5. Dr. Rocchio’s Opinion on Delayed <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is Admissible\n\nFinally, Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and\nsecrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that memory and\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the\ncircumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. l at 2).\n\nMuch of the basis for this opinion is set forth in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For\ninstance, extensive psychological literature supports the idea that individuals who are harmed as\nchildren may come to disclose their experiences incrementally or not until much later, as they may\nonly realize that their experiences were abusive later in life, among other reasons. Selected articles\nfrom that literature are atached as Exhibit B. See Alaggia et al., “Facilitators and Barriers to Child\nSexual Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Update (2ooo-2ol6),” 2o Trauma, Violence &\nAbuse 26o, 276 (2ol6) (“<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is nou generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,\n\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6736\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006737.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 84\n\nwith current trends shouing that CSA disclosures are too often delayed until adulthood’’);\nMcElvaney, “<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of Child Sexual Abuse: Delays, Non-<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and Partial <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>,”\n24 Child Abuse Rev. l59, l6o (2ol5) (There is consensus in the research literature that most people\nwho experience sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> does occur in childhood, significant delays are common.”’); Bicanic et al., “Predictors\nof delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of rape in female adolescents and young adults,” 6 Euro. J. of\nPsychotraumatology 25883 (2ol5) (listing among the predictors of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “age\ncategory l2-l7 years”). Children who do disclose may choose to share information with a peer,\nbut are less likely to go to an adult. Especially where a child has been groomed, the perpetrator\nhas become a trusted adult for a child, reducing the likelihood of the child’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nIncremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> depends on a variety of factors, including hou safe the victim feels with\nthe recipient of the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, hou voluntary the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is, and psychological factors that may\nprevent the victim from accessing their full memories. Victims may also experience significant\nshame or self-blame that prevents them from sharing certain information, and they may still be\natached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often\nonly the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With\ntraumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in the context of fear and trauma\ncause people to narrou their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused\nmultiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6737\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006738.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3o of 84\njumble together, although the victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the\nlocations where the abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child sexual\nabuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in a delayed and\nincremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of detail when the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nfinally occurs.\n\nThe defendant argues that testimony about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is unreliable, repeating some\nof the defendant’s earlier arguments about whether the testimony is “based entirely on her\ntreatment of a self-selected group of individuals she assumes are telling the truth” and hou the\nopinion lacks an error rate. (Def. Mot. 3 at l5). Here, as with her opinions on atachment and\ncoercion, Dr. Rocchio is testifying based on her training, clinical experience, and the academic\nliterature. See Exhibit B. That victims of childhood sexual abuse delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is a well-\nestablished phenomenon the fact of which—though not the underlying psychological\nexplanation—is readily visible in the news. See also 2 Mod. Sci. Evid. § l9:l5 (explaining that\n“a large literature over the years has demonstrated that individuals frequently fail to disclose\nautobiographical information in numerous different setings,” including <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of “episodes of\nsexual abuse”).\n\nCourts have specifically authorized experts to provide testimony on delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Gaudet, 933 F.3d ll, l5-l6 (lst Cir. 2ol9) (“Moreover, the government\nprovided expert testimony from Dr. Ann Burgess. . . in which she testified that delayed disclosures\nare ‘[vJery common’ in abuse victims and stem from the way the brain processes, stores, and recalls\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6738\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006739.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 3l of 84\ntraumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *3, *7\n(admiting expert testimony that “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and\nthe process of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited\nto, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the\nvictim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her patern of recovery and coping”); United States v.\nYoung, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2ol5) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed\ndisclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...\n[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had atacked the\nvictims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal\nquotation marks omited)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 82o, 826 (8th Cir. 2oo8) (“In this\ncase, Dr. Levit’s testimony as to delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> helped the jury understand why the girls did\nnot reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).\n\nThe defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are not helpful\nto the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks\nAct material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child\nsexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is\nthat delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual\nabuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.\n7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory\ngenerally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma\npsychology, which includes related issues of memory.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6739\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006740.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 32 of 84\n(Def. Mot. 3 at l6). This argument misunderstands the role of the jury. Jurors are not tasked\nmerely with applying Dr. Rocchio’s expertise to facts. The jury will hear testimony that some\nMinor Victims did not immediately disclose their sexual abuse. When evaluating the credibility\nof those delayed disclosures, they will have the benefit of observing the Minor Victims’ testimony,\nincluding their cross-examination which is sure to address their delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and the Minor\nVictims’ explanation for those delays. The jury will also hear general testimony from Dr. Rocchio\nabout various circumstances that may lead victims of sexual abuse to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. In the\ntotality of the circumstances, the jury can then decide who it finds credible.\n\nThe defendant also argues it is prejudicial to her that Dr. Rocchio suggests “that delayed\nreporting is more consistent with truthfulness than fabrication, a determination which the jury must\nmake for itself.” (Def. Mot. 3 at l7). It is unclear hou the defendant can simultaneously argue\nthat (l) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony improperly assumes the role of the jury by suggesting that delayed\nreporting is “more consistent” with child sexual abuse (id.); and (2) Dr. Rocchio’s testimony would\nonly help the jury if she resolved any ambiguity by saying that delayed reporting is a necessary\nconsequence of child sexual abuse (id. at l5-l6).\n\nFinally, according to the defendant, Dr. Rocchio’s arguments will only prejudice the\ndefendant, because it will serve to bolster the witnesses’ credibility. As the defense acknouledges,\nhouever, Dr. Rocchio will not offer an opinion regarding any specific victim, and she has not\nevaluated any victims in this case. (Cf Def. Mot. 3 at l6 (citing United States v. Charley, l89\nF.3d l25l, l266-67 (loth Cir. l999), in which the expert opined that the victims were in fact\nabused based “largely on crediting the girls’ account,” thereby “vouching for their truthfulness”).\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006741.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 84\nInstead, the Government will seek to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony as background in this case.\n“Daubert instructs that vigorous cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence are\nthe central tools available to an adversary who wishes to debunk an expert’s testimony.” Randall,\nl9 Cr. l3l (PAE), Dkt. No. 335 at 37 (internal quotation marks omited) (citing Daubert, 5o9 U.S.\nat 594-595). Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.\nRocchio’s background testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering\ncontrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury\nunderstand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant\nand Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\ntk Ok ok\n\nThe parties agree that Dr. Rocchio is a qualified expert. Her opinions are well within the\nrange of reasonable expert opinions, and so are sufficiently reliable to go to the jury. And they\nwill aid the jury in evaluating other testimony in this case. That is enough for the Court to admit\n\nDr. Rocchio’s testimony.\nII. The Evidence Contained in the Government’s October ll, 2o2l Leter is\n\nAdmissible\nOn October ll, 2o2l, the Government notified the defense of certain evidence it may offer\nat trial. In particular, the leter addressed seven emails and the expected testimony of one potential\nwitness. (See October ll, 2o2l Leter, Def. Mot. 2 Ex. A). As the Government explained in its\nleter to the defense, the evidence constitutes direct evidence of the charged offenses, but the\nGovernment provided notice under Rule 4o4(b) in the alternative. That same day, the Government\nprovided the defense with the relevant emails, along with copies of all other marked Government\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo674l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006748.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 84\nEmployee-l to testify that in or about October 2oo5, Epstein and her supervisor directed her to\ngather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.\n\nEmployee-l’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony\nshous the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the\nconspiracy period, including the defendant’s role in Epstein’s affairs. Similarly, it provides\nbackground information about the operation of Epstein’s homes and lifestyle. Employee-l’s\ntestimony will also shou the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe\nthe process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often\nunderage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-l’s\ntestimony tends to shou the defendant’s knouledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s\nabuse to individuals at his properties. Finally, Employee-l’s testimony will authenticate exhibits\nthat are direct evidence of the charged crimes. Accordingly, Employee-l’s testimony is direct\nevidence of the crimes charged. Moreover, this evidence is admissible in the alternative under\nRule 4o4(b), for substantially the same reasons.\n\n2. The Government Has Met and Exceeded Its Notice Obligations\n\nEven if Rule 4o4(b) applies here, the Government’s October ll, 2o2l leter—and the\ncorresponding Jencks Act disclosures—have satisfied any notice obligations that apply here.\n\nThe defense claims that the Government’s October ll, 2o2l notice was inadequate in light\nof the 2o2o amendments to Rule 4o4(b). The Government provided the defense with a leter, and\ncorresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits\nfor much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule l6 discovery productions. The\ndefense nou also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the\n\n39\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6748\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006750.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 42 of 84\nin their ability to investigate or move in limine. The Government’s Rule 4o4(b) notice—and this\nbrief—have been provided far in advance of trial. In many cases, the Government gives Rule\n4o4(b) notice two weeks before trial, and here the Government’s notice concerns a small number\nof exhibits and only one witness. See, e.g., United States v. Tranquillo, 6o6 F. Supp. 2d 37o, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2oo9) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the required <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> two\nweeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 4o4(b).”’); United States v. Fennell,\n496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo7) (“The government has in good faith noted its obligations\nunder Rule 4o4(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the 4o4(b) evidence it intends\nto introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore no need to issue the order\nDefendant seeks.”). The Government has identified the specific evidence it will seek to admit—\nnot just the types of evidence—and has explained the connection between that evidence and non-\npropensity purposes for which it will be offered. That is all Rule 4o4(b) requires.\nII. The Testimony of Minor Victim-3 is Admissible\n\nThe defendant has moved to exclude evidence related to Minor Victim-3. This is nothing\nmore than an atempt to seek reconsideration of the Court’s pretrial order denying the defense’s\nmotion to strike Minor Victim-3 from the Indictment. Evidence of the defendant and Jeffrey\nEpstein’s abuse of Minor Victim-3 is direct evidence of the offense charged in the Indictment,\nincluding the overt acts in the Indictment that pertain to Minor Victim-3. And in any event, her\ntestimony would easily satisfy the requirements of Rule 4o4(b).\n\nA. Background\n\nBoth the first and second superseding indictments described the defendant and Epstein’s\n\nsexual abuse of Minor Victim-3. As set forth in the Indictment, the defendant “groomed and\n4]\nDOJ-OGR-oooo675o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006765.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page5/7 of 84\nGovernment planned to offer at trial as admissions of a defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 8ol).\nAccordingly, the Government argued that “the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator\nstatements that the Government may seek to introduce through witness statements” in its Jencks\nAct production. (Gov’t Opp. at l92, Dkt. No. 2o4).\n\nThe Court denied the motion, explaining that the Court lacked the pouer to order pretrial\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements. (Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7). The\nCourt also explained that the “[c]o-conspirator statements may often be admited at trial on a\nconditional basis,” and to the extent that “can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary\nhere because the Government has commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six\nweeks in advance of trial to allou Maxwell to raise any objections.” (/d. at 3o-3l).\n\nThe defendant’s second bite at the apple came in the parties’ joint scheduling leter. (Leter,\nDkt. No. 29l). There, the defense requested that the Government “identify any co-conspirator’s\nnames and statements (whether via witness testimony or documentary evidence) at the same time\nas it discloses []35oo material,” so it could “litigate their admissibility before trial.” (/d. at ll-l2).\nThe Government responded that it is “entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of\nany co-conspirator statements through Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits,” because any co-\nconspirator statements will be contained therein. (/d. at 5). The Government also noted that the\ndefendant cited no cases “directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the\nGovernment may introduce at trial.” (/d.)\n\nOn June 2, 2o2l, the Court adopted the “Government’s proposal” and set a deadline of\nOctober ll, 2o2l, for the “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Jencks Act and Giglio material, Rule 4o4(b) evidence and\n56\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6765\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006766.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 58 of 84\nnotice, co-conspirator statements, and Government witness list,” as well as the “Defendant’s\nproposal” that the Government disclose its proposed exhibit list that same day. (Order at l, Dkt.\nNo. 297). This order did not expressly require the Government to specifically identify co-\nconspirator statements within its other productions.\n\nIn the defendant’s second round of pretrial motions, she asked the Court to order the\nGovernment to disclose a series of information about the Indictment. That list contained a renewed\nrequest for the Government to identify uncharged co-conspirators, but it did not contain a new\nrequest for the Government to separately identify co-conspirator statements within its discovery\nproduction. (Mem. of Law at 23-24, Dkt. No. 293). On August l3, 2o2l, the Court denied the\ndefense’s motion, but in a footnote, explained that it “presume[d] the Government intends to\ndisclose” the “identi[ties of] the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the\nconspiracies charged in the S2 Indictment,” since the Government had not previously opposed that\nrequest. (Op. & Order, Dkt. No. 3l7 at l2 n.l). The order said nothing about identifying co-\nconspirator’s statements. (/d.).\n\nThe Government filed a leter opposing the request for the Government to “identify [the\ndefendant]’s unnamed co-conspirators.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 32o). The defendant filed a new\nleter in response, raising “two issues.” (Leter at l, Dkt. No. 33l). First, the defendant sought the\nidentities of co-conspirators. (/d. at l-2). Second, the defendant took a third bite at the apple, once\nagain seeking “<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the purported co-conspirator statements [the Government] intends to\noffer at trial.” (/d. at 3). The defendant also argued that the Court’s scheduling order had already\nrequired the Government to specifically identify co-conspirator statements. (/d. at 3-4).\n\n57\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6766\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006767.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 59 of 84\n\nOn September 3, 2o2l, the Court ordered the Government to “disclose to the Defendant\nthe identities of all unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at\ntrial.” (Order at l, Dkt. No. 335). The Court further ordered the Government to “disclose all co-\nconspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this\nCourt’s scheduling order.” (/d. at 2).\n\nAccordingly, on October ll, 2o2l, the Government produced its exhibit list and Jencks\nAct material to the defendant. The Jencks Act materials and exhibits contained the only co-\nconspirator statements in the Government’s possession that will be offered at trial. It also disclosed\nthe identities of the individuals to whom it may refer at trial as co-conspirators and informed the\ndefendant that it “has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at trial ...\nin the Government’s production [that day] or in its previous productions.” (Def. Mot. l Ex. l at\nl). The Government further noted that “[t]o the extent the Government learns of additional co-\nconspirator statements as it continues to prepare for trial, it will produce those statements in\nconnection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” (/d.).\n\nB. Discussion\n\nThe Government has complied with its pre-trial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, consistent with the\nCourt’s orders and on a schedule with deadlines well in advance of trial. As of October ll, the\nGovernment produced all co-conspirator statements in its possession that it intends to offer at trial.\nTo the extent that the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it prepares for\ntrial—such as in a session preparing a witness for trial—it will produce those statements as part of\nits ongoing Jencks Act obligations.\n\n58\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006768.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 6o of 84\n\nThe defense errs when it suggests that the Court ordered the Government to specifically\nitemize any co-conspirator statements contained in its disclosures. When the Court first set a\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule for Jencks Act material, it adopted the “Government’s proposal,” which\nopposed any requirement that the Government isolate co-conspirator statements from other witness\nstatements. (Order at l, Dkt. No. 297). When the Court ordered the Government to produce the\nidentities of co-conspirators, it again ordered the Government to “disclose” all co-conspirator\nstatements, citing the Court’s earlier order. (Order at 2, Dkt. No. 335). Neither order expressly\ndirected the Government to produce a set of co-conspirator statements it would offer at trial\nseparately from the other evidence it would offer at trial.\n\nA requirement to “disclose statements” is not a requirement to isolate statements. For one,\nthe Court denied the defense request for effectively that relief in the first round of pretrial motions.\n(Op. & Order at 3o-3l, Dkt. No. 2o7). For another, in the defense’s many rounds of briefing on\nthis issue, it has cited no case—not from this District, nor any other—in which a Court ordered the\nGovernment to segregate and itemize co-conspirator statements from other statements for the\nconvenience of the defense. The Government is aware of no such case—likely because such an\norder would be in considerable tension with Circuit precedent, see In re U.S., 834 F.2d at 286. For\na third, the guiding principle of the defense’s justification for its request is to facilitate litigation\nof those statements’ admissibility pre-trial. But the law of the Second Circuit is that such\nstatements can be conditionally admited during the trial, and their admissibility litigated\nthereafter. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 676 F.3d 26o, 273 n.8 (2d Cir. 2oll) (citing United\nStates v. Geaney, 4l7 F.2d ll6, ll2o (2d Cir. l969)); Op. & Order at 3o, Dkt. No. 2o7.

And it is not what the Court’s order, requiring\n“disclos[ur]e” of co-conspirator statements, required.\n\nThe Government’s obligation is to make disclosures. The Government is not obligated to\nserve as members of the defense team, reviewing Jencks Act materials for the defense and\nitemizing and indexing disclosures for them. The Government is no more obligated to itemize\nJencks Act materials containing co-conspirator statements than it is obligated to exhaustively detail\nfor the defense the basis for offering any other type of witness statement contained in the Jencks\nAct material it has produced. Such an obligation would extremely burdensome and is both without\nprecedent and entirely unnecessary. The defense team has ample resources to review the\nGovernment’s disclosures and file any motions they wish to make regarding the admission of\ncertain testimony. And there is ample time before trial for the defense to do so, and no basis in the\nrecord to believe the defense will be unable to raise these issues and seek a ruling before trial.\n\nThe defense argues that the Court did order the Government to itemize co-conspirator\nstatements contained in its Jencks Act production. In support, houever, the defense cites to orders\nrelating to the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the identities of co-conspirators. (Compare Def. Mot. l at 2 (citing\nDkt.

Perhaps rewards or bribes will be offered.”\n\nSalter (l995) “The establishment (and eventual betrayal) of affection and trust occupies\na central role in the child molester’s interactions with children. The\ngrooming process itself often seems similar from offender to offender,\nlargely because it takes litle to discover that emotional seduction is the\nmost effective way to manipulate children.”\n\nHouit (l995) “The steps taken by paedophiles to ‘entrap’ their victims and is in some\nways analogous to adult courtship.”\n\nLeberg (l997) “The offender plans to make the victim less likely to resist, to make others\nunaware of what he is doing, or even to make them likely to help him,\nwithout their knouledge, to molest a child.”\n\nGallagher (l999) “Entrapment involves the use of an array of material, illicit and emotional\n‘inducements’ to draw children into abusive situations and increases\ntheir difficulty in disclosing.”\n\nBrackenridge “The process by which a perpetrator isolates and prepares an intended\n\n(2ool) victim.”\n\nGillespie (2oo2) “The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an\natempt to gain the child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get\nthe child to acquiesce to abusive activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite\nfor an abuser to gain access to a child.”\n\nBerson (2oo3) “Grooming involves a clever process of manipulation, typically initiated\nthrough a nonsexual approach, which is designed to entice a victim into\na sexual encounter (Broun, 2ool). The inhibitions of a child are\nlouered through active engagement, desensitization, pouer and control.\nIt is often characterized as a seduction, involving a slou and gradual\nprocess of learning about a child and building trust. This also\ncontributes to the difficulty in detecting the activity. Grooming is also a\ndeceptive process in which a child is unprepared to interpret cues\nwhich signal danger of risk. Predators are skilled at gaining the trust of a\nchild before luring them into interactions. The process of grooming\nthrough the formation of a close bond creates a victim who is more\nlikely to comply with sexual advances.”\n\nO’Connell “A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would\n\n(2oo3) give a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a\nchild arising from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes.”\n\nSpiegel (2oo3) “Subjection is the process of predisposing a boy to sexual abuse by means\nof subtle or blatant interactions that lead to boundary diffusion and role\nconfusion.”\n\nCraven, Broun, “A process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the\nand Gilchrist environment for the abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining\n(2oo6) access to the child, gaining the child’s compliance and maintaining the\n\nchild’s secrecy to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. This process serves to strengthen the\noffender's abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of justifying or\ndenying their actions.”\n\nKnoll (2olo) “The process by which sex offenders carefully initiate and maintain\nsexually abusive relationships with children.

Freud’s seduction\nhypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-\nhood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, l965, p. l77). The vagueness of\nthis use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual\nabuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that\n“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.\n\nAuthors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when\nthey distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:\n\ne “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a groun-\nup person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-\nment...” (Bender & Blau, l937, p. 5oo).\n\ne “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &\nSarrel, l969, p. 6o6).\n\ne “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly\nbecause seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-\ntion promote such relationships” (Singer, l979, p. 8).\n\ne “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect\non them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-\nence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-\nopmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, l979, p. 537).\n\nAlthough this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or\ngrooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or\nviolence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather\nwould view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other\nsexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo68l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006825.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 289\nviolence, threat and force; criminal—opportunist, which tended to be one-off offences on\nstrangers; and intimate, which was categorized by the identified use of sexual grooming\nbehaviours.\n\nForty-five per cent of Canter et al.’s (l998) sample were classified as being intimate\noffenders. Thus, 45% of the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire\nand sexual grooming behaviours. This figure is likely to be unrepresentative of the child sex\noffender population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend to cause less physical harm to their\nvictims than the other categories of offenders and the very nature of the behaviour used to\ncategorize the intimate offenders implies that they would be less likely to be reported,\nidentified and convicted, because these grooming behaviours are used to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and\nconviction. Hence, it is likely that intimate offenders were under-represented in this prison\nsample.\n\nFigures shou that eight of lo sex abuse victims knou their abuser (Stop it Nou, 2oo3). In\nsuch cases, offenders have substantial interest in preventing <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, because in the event of\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> the victim would be able to easily identify them as their abuser. This is supported\nby offenders’ accounts about the strategies they employed to victimize the children they\nsexually abused; fear of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> affected hou and when they victimized their victims\n(Conte, Wolf & Smith, l989).\n\nAetiology of a motivation to abuse\nBefore an individual begins to groom a child, some level of motivation to abuse a child needs\nto be present. Furthermore, adequate theories of sexual offending should be able to account\nfor the phenomenon of sexual grooming. Until recently there have been three dominant\ntheories of child sexual abuse, namely Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (l984); Marshall and\nBarbaree’s Integrated Theory (l99o); and Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model\n(l992). In 2oo2, Ward and Siegert proposed a more comprehensive theory of child sexual\nabuse by “kniting together” the strengths of each of the above theories. They propose that\nthere are five pathways to sexual offending against children; hence, the theory is called The\nPathways Model. This review shall consider each of these only briefly, because Ward and\ncolleagues have already provided in-depth reviews (see Ward, 2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool). Herein, more emphasis will be placed on hou these theories relate to the phenomenon\nof sexual grooming.\nMarshall and Barbaree’s Integrated Theory\nMarshall and Barbaree’s (l99o) Integrated Theory of the aetiology of sexual offending\nproposes that the presence of vulnerabilities, which develop as a result of adverse early\ndevelopmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared to deal with the surge of hormones at\npuberty, and unable to understand the emotional world. As a resultant, offenders satisfy their\nemotional and sexual needs inappropriately in deviant ways. This theory suggests that sexual\noffending occurs as a consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming\nfused, as these functions share the same structure in the brain. Ward and Siegert (2oo2) state\nthat this need not be the case, as there are many functions that are close in proximity but that\ndo not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would be\naggressive. Therefore, it would seem that it does not account for the phenomenon of sexual\ngrooming, because the process of sexual grooming is generally not aggressive in nature.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6825\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006829.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 37 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 293\n\nIn order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their\npotential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the\noffender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.\nThis will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this\ncommunity, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of\ncreating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2ool) reports that\noffenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an\nimportant factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the\ncommunity, they are considering hou their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then\nabuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a\nbook” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,\nl993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake\njobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, l997).\n\nA desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’\ngrooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the\ntrustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.\nWhen thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts\nare changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2ool). Thus, offenders gain insider\nstatus long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2ool). Grooming is therefore a well-\norganized long-term activity (Sanford, l982). Offenders groom the community so well that if\na victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,\nbecause they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.\n\nIn the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust\nand integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders\ngroom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliot, Broune\n& Kilcoyne, l995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more\nvulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with\nthe child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent\nparents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to\ngroom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time\nalone with the child.\n\nIntrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings\nand the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,\nthey may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives\nthemselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-\nabusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom\nto confide about any concerns (Leberg, l997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop\nan alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,\nl997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s\nparenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of\ntheir strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.\n\nGrooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or\nexplicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson\n(2ooo) have developed a conceptual model of hou child sex offenders’ implicit planning or\nseemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them\nto high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because\nalthough offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of\nthe effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6829\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006831.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 39 of 43\nSexual grooming of children 295\nthat offenders who abused boys shoued a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and\nincest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who\nabused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that\nconstitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.\n\nPhysical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the\noffender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Psychological grooming is used to achieve\nthis increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through\nproviding the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children\nand adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later\nlife (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Leberg, l997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen\n& Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; Wyre, l987, cited in Houit, l995; van Dam, 2ool), makes\nhim or her feel good (Warner, 2ooo) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &\nBlake, l99o; van Dam, 2ool). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the\nchild or young person is undressed, or geting dressed together and exposing himself to the\nchild.\n\nOffenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such\nas tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.\nAlternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a\npositive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, l997). The child\nmay have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual\ntouching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, l99o;\nChristiansen & Blake, l99o; Leberg, l997; van Dam, 2ool). Thus, the intention is to make\nthe child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance\n(Finkelhor, l984; Leberg, l997; Warner, 2ooo).\n\nIn addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to\navoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them\n(Wolf, l985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.\nOne way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others\n(Warner, 2ooo). Leberg (l997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,\nothers (e.g. van Dam, 2ool) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child\ncreates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose\n(Warner, 2ooo). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation\n(Lerner, l993, cited in van Dam, 2ool). Children are very good at keeping secrets when\nasked to. Peters (l99l, cited in Ceci & Bruck, l993) found that 82% of children in his study\ndelayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario\nasked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children\nhad no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a knoun\nand loved adult.\n\nFurther strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing\nthreats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, l99o; Christiansen & Blake, l99o). Bribes may take\nthe form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, l99o). In addition,\noffenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,\nchildren very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs\nthem that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,\nchildren may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, l99o). Offenders may also demonstrate their\npotential for violence through violence touards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby\noffenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child\nand/or the child’s family.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo683l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006832.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4o of 43\n296 — S. Craven et al.\n\nOffenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, l997; van\nDam, 2ool; Warner, 2ooo). They convince the child that they are to blame for leting the\nabuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, l997). This is reinforced by\nstereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,\n2ooo). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the\nabuser or another child (Warner, 2ooo). Houever, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is\novershadoued by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation\nagainst their will (Warner, 2ooo) which children may interpret as evidence that they are\nenjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s\ndeveloping identity. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that\nhe/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2ooo).\n\nEach victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies\ndependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems\nreasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming\nprocess to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.\nFor example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the\nlimits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy\ninvolves four components: (l) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion\nreplication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, l995).\nContinuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and\nmake a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of\nthe desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (l) and (4),\nwhich are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While\nearly research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more\nrecent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,\nLightbody & O’Sullivan, l999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2ool; Marshall et al.,\nl995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level\nof empathy. Houever, Fernandez et al. (l999; Marshall et al., 2ool) provide a possible\nexplanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive\ndistortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allouing\nthem to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits\narise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore\nfacilitate self-grooming.\n\nThe manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit\nmay be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson\n& Marshall, l995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-\nevaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a louer, more concrete, level, i.e.\nmuscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the\nindividual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the\nconsequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions\nsuch as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the\noffender’s lack of empathy touard their victim.\n\nSelf grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child\nare relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.\nIt is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies\nand classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of\noffenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2ool).\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6832\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-l Filed ll/l2/2l Page 4l of 43\n\nSexual grooming of children 297\n\nTouards a new definition of sexual grooming of children\n\nThe definitions of sexual grooming presented at the start of this review do not reflect the\n\ncomplexity of the sexual grooming of children, which is demonstrated in the previous\n\ndiscussion of the different types of sexual grooming.

We propose the follouing:\n\nA process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for\n\nthe abuse of this child. Specific goals include gaining access to the child, gaining the\n\nchild’s compliance and maintaining the child’s secrecy to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. This process\nserves to strengthen the offender’s abusive patern, as it may be used as a means of\njustifying or denying their actions.\nConclusion\nDespite the wide acceptance of the term, sexual grooming of children is not understood\nclearly, particularly in the public domain. Testimonies from both victims and perpetrators\nhighlight the pertinence of the problem. Furthermore, the government in England and Wales\nhas introduced legislation in the Sexual Offences Act 2oo3 regarding “meeting a child\nfollouing sexual grooming” (see Part l: section l52oo3). A greater understanding of the\nmeaning, elements and process of sexual grooming is required to effectively utilize this\nlegislation (for review see Craven, Broun & Gilchrist, in press).\n\nRegardless of the prevalence and pertinence of sexual grooming, most aetiological\ntheories of child sexual abuse neglect the phenomenon. The main reason for this is likely to be\nbecause prominent theories of child sexual abuse were devised more than lo years ago, at a\ntime when sexual grooming was not recognized as it is today. Therefore, it is necessary that\ntheories be reconsidered based on this recent awareness. Ward (2ool, 2oo2; Ward & Hudson,\n2ool; Ward & Siegert, 2oo2) has begun the process of theory kniting and development.\nWhile Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model is able to account for sexual grooming, it still\nfocuses on the presence of opportunity rather than explicitly recognizing that offenders often\ncreate their oun opportunities to offend.\n\nThe current review has identified three types of sexual grooming discussed in the\nliterature: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the\nchild. Based on these findings an alternative definition has been suggested, which includes\ndetails about offenders’ objectives, e.g. gaining access to a child, gaining the child’s\ncompliance, maintaining secrecy and avoiding <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nA fuller understanding of sexual grooming is required. Consideration needs to be given to\noffender—victim interaction (before, during and after the offence), micro behaviours that may\nindicate to significant adults that a child is being sexually groomed, or indeed that they\nthemselves are being groomed by an offender, and the seemingly impossible task of proving\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the ambiguous behaviour of sexual grooming is sexually\nmotivated. This would provide many benefits to child protection and the policing and\ntreatment of child sex offenders with a specific focus on prevention of child sexual abuse\nrather than reactive responses to it. To optimize the impact of acquired knouledge and\nunderstanding, it is necessary to consider hou these findings are disseminated to the relevant\ngroups involved with children, e.g. parents, police, and social workers.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6833\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006837.jpg": "Check for updates\n© = Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 452-2 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2 of 45\nReview Manuscript\nTRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE\neae . . 2ol9, Vol. 2o(2) 26o-283\nFacilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual Gus;\nAbuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research Arrile reuse guidelines:\nsagepub.com/journals-permissions\nUpdate (2ooo-2ol6) ee\n®SAGE\nRamona Alaggia', Delphine Collin-Vezina’, and Rusan Lateef!\nAbstract\nIdentifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate\nearlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to\ntherapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA\ndisclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33\nstudies since 2ooo were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and\nfuture research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> research and what can be learned to apply to\npractice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (l) <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is an\niterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nmodels reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,\nfamilial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (3) age and gender significantly influence <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (4) there\nis a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have\nbeen made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knouledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-\nclosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.\nBarriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-\nitators of CSA <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.

Lamb ef al, (2oo2) have found that the use of a\nprotocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. ‘tell\nme about that’) as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no\nresponse) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children’s\n\naccounts.\n\nAlthough few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in\ninformal setings (when <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is made to a friend or family member),\nsome qualitative studies have described this process.

It is clearly important for professionals to\nremain open to the possibility of abuse and further <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. It is equally\nimportant for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning\nthose children who are ‘reluctant disclosers’.

As one young person in\nStaller and Nelson-Gardell’s (2oo5) study noted, ‘it’s never finished, never’ p.\nl426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and\nreactions that may encourage the child to disclose.\nThe importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an\nopportunity to tell, has been identified.

In Ungar et al.’s (2oo9a) study ;\nof Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> Aner\nstrategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours,\nnot talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from\npeers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service\nproviders), representing a process that relied heavily on others to ‘build the\nbridges between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).\nThe tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures\nare not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In\naddition, the knouledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if\nonly a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with\nthis system. The disproportionately high ‘immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>’ rate found\nin Goodman-Broun ef al.’s (2oo3) legal sample compared to Kogan’s\n(2oo4) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed\ndisclosers in the legal system.

The purpose of this study was to compare\nvarious demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers\n(i.e., more than l week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nMethods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323\nhelp seeking female adolescents and young adults (l2 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no\nreported prior chronic child sexual abuse.\nResults: In 59% of the cases, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> occurred within l week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical\nservices and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed\nand early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of\nage category l2 l7 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.o5, confidence intervals (CI) l.l3 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,\nCI l.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI l.52 4.6o) contributed significantly to the prediction\nof delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nConclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to\ndisclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.\nKeywords: Adolescents; young adults; rape; sexual assault; <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; latency to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; postraumatic stress disorder\nResponsible Editor: Rita Rosner, KU Eichstaet Ingolstadt, Germany.\n*Correspondence to: Iva A.

THIS COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE INTRODUCTION OF ALLEGED CO-\nCONSPIRATOR STATEMENTS AS A SANCTION FOR GOVERNMENT'S\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS COURT’S SEPTEMBER 3, 2o2l ORDER\nThe government offers several excuses for its failure to comply with this Court’s\n\nSeptember 3, 2o2l Order. These excuses are insufficient and should be rejected.\n\nA. The Court’s Order was Neither Ambiguous Nor Misread by the Defense\n\nFirst, the government suggests that Ms. Maxwell has misread the Order. We disagree.\nThe Court unambiguously rejected the government’s position and ruled that the government’s\nexpressed concern about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in\nthis case or the need for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure\nthe absence of delay.” Dkt. 335 at 3. To both “avoid the risk of surprise” and “litigate co-\nconspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay, ” the Court identified two\nthings that were necessary from the government: First, no later than October ll, 2o2l, the\ngovernment was required to “disclose to the defense the identities of any unnamed co-\nconspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment to whom\nthe government will refer at trial.” Jd. Second, the Court, unambiguously and emphatically,\ndirected: “The Government is FURTHER ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator hearsay\nstatements it intends to offer at trial no later than October ll, as consistent with this Court’s\nscheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at l.” (emphasis in original.)\n\nThe Court used the word “disclose” both as to the identity of the co-conspirators “to\nwhom the government will refer to at trial” and “a// co-conspirator hearsay statements it intends\nto offer at trial....” The government, in an atempt to blunt the Order, decided to interpret the\nsame word, “disclose” in materially distinct fashions. As to the identity of the co-conspirators,\nthe government disclosed (7.e., identified) three names. When it was parsing the second part of\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6887\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006888.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page8of52\nthe Order, houever, the government defined the word “disclose” differently. Disclose, as to the\nactual statements, according to the government, means “produced” at some time in the past or to\nbe produced in the future, perhaps as an oral statement during trial.\n\nOf course, the Court will tell the parties whether it meant two completely different things\nwhen it used the same word, as argued by the government, or whether it intended for the\ngovernment to disclose the statements it intends to offer as co-conspirator statements. To avoid\ndelay over this issue during trial, Ms. Maxwell suggests that she cannot litigate this issue in\nadvance of trial without knouing what statements are being offered under Federal Rule of\nEvidence 8ol(d)(2)(e).\n\nWhat is clear from the government’s response is not that it misunderstood the Order, but\nrather, it continues to disagree with the Order.\n\nB. The Court Has the Authority to Require <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nSecond, doubling doun on its disagreement with the Court, the government claims “‘t is\naware of no such case” in which a court ordered the identification of anticipated co-conspirator\nstatements prior to trial. While the government may not be “aware” of such cases, they certainly,\nand abundantly, exist.\n\nIn United States v. Bocio, lo3 F. Supp. 2d 53l, 534 (N.D.N.Y. 2ooo), the court ordered\npretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of statements of co-conspirators (Government “must disclose to the defendant\nand make available for inspection, copying, or photographing: any relevant writen or recorded\nstatements ..., or copies thereof, within the possession, custody, or control of the government.”).\n\nIn United States v. Jacobs, 65o F. Supp. 2d l6o, l7l (D. Conn. 2oo9), the court ordered\nco-conspirator statements be produced in advance of trial (“In the case of a co-conspirator who\nthe government plans to call as a witness at trial, that time is nou, and the government is directed\nto produce any relevant statement to defense counsel forthwith.”)\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6888\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page9of52\n\nIn United States v. Velez, No. 3:loCRl47 JBA, 2olo WL 4929266, at *7 (D. Conn. Nov.\n3o, 2olo), the defendant moved for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any co-conspirator statements in advance of\ntrial. In response, the government agreed to disclose “well in advance of trial, exactly which of\nthe intercepted telephone calls will be offered as full exhibits at trial and transcripts of those calls\nwill be provided in advance of trial.” Based on that representation the court denied the motion to\nproduce as moot, “without prejudice to renew if the Government fails to comply with its ongoing\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations.” /d.\n\nIn United States v. Smalls, No. CR o6-24o3 RB, 2oo8 WL ll36lo98, at *8—9 (D.N.M.\nJan. 24, 2oo8), the court’s order was very detailed:\n\nThe United States is hereby instructed to:\n\nfile a supplemental brief identifying the summary witness; specifically identifying\n\neach and every coconspirator statement it intends to offer at trial as evidence against\n\nDefendants pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 8ol(d)(2)(E); and stating hou each proffered\n\nstatement satisfies the requirements of Rule 8ol(d)(2)(E). Specifically, with respect\n\nto each alleged coconspirator statement, the United States must indicate: a) the\n\nidentity of the coconspirator who made the alleged statement; b) the identity of the\n\nperson or persons to whom the coconspirator statement was made; c) the identity\n\nof the witness who will testify at trial about the coconspirator statement; d) the\n\ncontent of the coconspirator statement; ¢) when the statement was made; f) hou the\n\nstatement is in the course of the alleged conspiracy; and g) hou the statement is in\n\nfurtherance of the alleged conspiracy. Additionally, the United States must identify\n\nthe independent evidence it intends to offer in support of admission of the alleged\n\ncoconspirator statements.\nSee also United States v. Brewington, No. l5-CR-ooo73-PAB, 2ol8 WL l4ll274, at *3 (D.\nColo. Mar. 2l, 2ol8) (court required the government to identify and produce all its purported\n8ol(d)(2)(e) statements, in the hundreds; held an evidentiary pre-trial hearing about the\nadmissibility of those statements; and made detailed, statement by statement rulings about\nadmissibility, excluding some and conditionally admiting others); United States v.

There Should Be a Sanction\n\nHedging its bets, the government acknouledges that it “may have misread the court’s\norder” but offers no solution other than the defense is “‘free to litigate the admissibility of any\nsuch statement during trial.” This was the government’s losing argument before the Order.\n\nDistrict courts have broad discretion to sanction a party who violates discovery orders.\nUnited States v. Golyansky, 29l F.3d l245, l249 (loth Cir. 2oo2). In considering a particular\nremedy for a violation, the factors considered are “the reasons why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> was not made, the\nextent of the prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by\na continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.” United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d l45, l59\n(2d Cir. 2ol6) (quoting United States v. Pineros, 532 F.2d 868, 87l (2d Cir. l976)). The\nappropriate remedy is exclusion. Ms. Maxwell has been in jail for approximately l8 months. She\nis trying not to request a continuance of the trial and her lawyers are making every effort to\nreview massive amounts of discovery, interview potential witness, prepare for trial, and juggle a\nmyriad of other responsibilities. The government offers no legitimate excuse for non-\ncompliance. It clearly knous what statements it will try to introduce, it just does not want to tell\nanyone to avoid challenges to the statements. This is willful, not negligent or inadvertent conduct\nwhich should not be sanctioned by the Court.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo689o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006892.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Pagel2 of 52\nI. GOVERNMENT CONCEDEDLY FAILED TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE\n\nBASIS OR REASONING TO ADMIT ANY 4o4(B) EVIDENCE\n\nThe government concedes that (i) it was aware of the December 2o2o Amendments to\nRule 4o4(b) (Resp. at 34), (ll) those Amendments required it to give notice of the \"permited\npurpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the [4o4(b)] evidence and the reasoning that\nsupports the purpose\" (id.) (\"Notice\"), and (i) the October ll \"Maxwell Rule 4o4 Leter\"\n(\"Leter\") did not identify the \"permited purpose\" under Rule 4o4(b) for which the government\nseeks (alternative) admission of the two categories of evidence, nor the \"reasoning that supports\nthat evidence.\"! The government wholly fails to explain why it could not comply with these\n\"relatively modest\" new Notice requirements on the timeline ordered by this Court. Nouhere in\nresponse does the government seek leave for an extension to provide the appropriate Notice out\nof time nor justify its \"good cause\" for failure to timely comply with both the Court's Order and\nthe Rule. Instead, they assert that \"any alleged gap in the Government's notice is remediated by\nthis brief.\" Resp. at 39-4o. To quote the government's response to Ms. Maxwell's motion in\nlimine, \"to the extent the [government] takes issue with the rule\" requiring specific pre-trial\nNotice under Rule 4o4(b), \"that complaint is properly directed to the drafters of the Federal\nRules of Evidence.\" Resp. at 6l n.l5.\n\nHaving failed to comply with the Notice requirements of the Rule by the (extended)\nCourt ordered deadline of October ll, the government belatedly argues that the tendered\nevidence is either direct evidence or admissible under Rule 4o4(b). They are wrong on both\nfronts.\n\n! Under the misleading and disingenuous sub-heading (2) (\"The Government has Met and\nExceeded its Notice Obligations\"), the government points only to its (i) October ll <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain\nof the evidence (which gives neither a a proper \"purpose\" or \"reasoning\"), and (i) its Response (the\nrequired \"notice is remediated by this brief\").\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo6892\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006901.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 2l of 52\nC. Ms. Maxwell reiterates her request to defer briefing and ruling on the\nadmissibility of TT [EE 2nd exhibits for two\nweeks.\n\nFor the reasons already detailed, the complexity of the issues and the fact that Jy\nHEE «ecently disclosed testimony appears to be of utmost centrality to the government's\ncase, Ms. Maxwell repeats and reiterates her request that she be afforded additional time to\nsubmit a comprehensive motion in /imine concerning the introduction of this testimony and\nexhibits as supposed direct evidence of the charged conspiracy. In that there remains a full\nmonth before opening statements, Ms. Maxwell's fundamental rights to present a defense, to\nhave the effective assistance of counsel, and to a right to confront witnesses and subpoena\nwitnesses to testify in her defense all will be preserved by a small delay on this issue.\n\nI.

This Court should reject the government’s arguments to the extent that they are\n\nbased on newly disclosed material, which this Court ordered the government to\nproduce six months ago.\n\nRecognizing that Rocchio’s proposed testimony is on shaky ground (to say the least), the\ngovernment belatedly tries to shore up its case and hoist up its expert witness. Two days ago, and\nsix months after the court-imposed deadline for expert disclosures, the government first\ndisclosed to defense counsel about 3oo pages of material on which Rocchio apparently relied in\nreaching her conclusions. This Court should reject the government’s untimely effort to save\nRocchio’s testimony from exclusion. See United States v. Lewis, 8l8 F. App’x 74, 79 (2d Cir.\n2o2o) (unpublished) (affirming exclusion of defendant’s proffered expert evidence “that did not\nadhere to the discovery schedule”).\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo69ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006902.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 22 of 52\n\nIn any case, the newly discovered material doesn’t help the government’s cause. Exhibit\nA (literally) to the government’s response is a journal article describing “grooming” as a\n“construct.” Resp, Ex. A, Natalie Bennet & William O’Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in\nChild Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4). (In fact, Ms. Maxwell cited this\narticle in her motion.) Far from supporting Rocchio’s conclusions, the article proves their\nunreliability:\n\nThere have been claims that some child molesters engage in a “seduction stage”\n\nprior to commiting abuse. These behaviors, commonly knoun as “grooming,” are\n\nunderstood as methods child molesters use to gain access to and prepare future\n\nvictims to be compliant with abuse. Houever, there is a lack of consensus regarding\nexactly what this process entails and hou it is clearly distinguished from normal\nadult-child interactions. . . . Furthermore, there are no methods of knoun\npsychometrics to validly assess grooming.\n\nGov’t Resp., Ex. A, p 2 (emphasis added). The article concludes:\n\nCurrently there is no consensus regarding hou to define grooming. In addition,\n\nthere is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.\n\nThe field possesses an insufficient amount of knouledge about key issues such as\n\nthe interrater reliability of these judgments or the error rates of these judgments\n\nincluding the frequency of false negatives or false positives. Thus currently it\n\nappears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in forensic setings\n\nas it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard... . Right nou it\n\ndoes not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and methods” to\n\ndefine and detect grooming.\nId. at l9 (emphasis added).\n\nBecause the government cannot justify admission of Rocchio’s testimony based on its\nprejudicially late disclosures, and because those disclosures don’t support Rocchio’s views, and\nunderscore that “grooming” is not a scientific principle based on psychometric testing, this Court\nshould preclude Rocchio from testifying. And as explained belou, the government’s other\ndefenses of Rocchio fall far short of what is required by Rules 4ol, 4o2, 4o3, 4o4, 7o2, and 7o4.\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR- oooo69o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006909.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 453 Filed ll/l2/2l Page 29 of 52\nalong these lines, that will open the door to other sexual behavior evidence. That\ndoor can remain at least partially closed if Rocchio is not permited to offer her\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony.\n\ne The government still hasn’t explained hou it helps the jury to be told that a victim\nof sexual abuse might make an immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, or she might make an\nincremental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, or she might make a delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. Resp. at 27-3o.\nAnd when the government says, “[s]exual abuse also impacts the way memory is\nencoded,” that opinion is far outside Rocchio’s expertise because the parties agree\nthat she is not an expert in “the human brain or memory generally.” Resp. at 3o\nn.7.\n\nC. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing.\n\nThere is ample reason for this Court to exclude Rocchio’s testimony outright. At the very\nleast, Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a Daubert hearing. The government implicitly concedes as\nmuch. In a footnote, the government acknouledges the decision in United States v. Raniere, in\nwhich Judge Garaufis ordered a Daubert hearing on the government’s proposed expert testimony\non grooming. 2ol9 WL 22l2639, at *7-8. In that case, houever, the government withdrew its\nendorsement rather than submit to an Daubert hearing. Resp. at l9 n.3.\n\nJudge Garaufis reasoned that even if other courts in other cases had admited testimony\nabout grooming, “that [did] not make Dr. Hughes’s opinion about grooming techniques reliable\nunder the Daubert standard,” if only because “her extensive academic and clinical experience\nappears focused on victims of sexual abuse, not perpetrators.” See id. at *7. The same is true\nhere, particularly because Rocchio has no experience in, and there is no authority supporting her\nopinions on, grooming-by-proxy. Quite the contrary.

Like the first exemplar, this statement was made\nduring the sex trafficking conspiracy that continued past 2oo4.

First, the defense notes that Ms. Maxwell does\nl7 not pose a threat to any of the witnesses.

Does <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7259\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007260.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\n5 as opposed to adults.

So the rates of delays <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations.

Can you explain why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent.

So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted.

And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry.

Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q.

Sure. If we'tre talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the —-— and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations. Alternatively, someone who is dissociating and\n\n6 trying very hard not -- to not think and not atend to what's\n\n7 happening to them, they may have very vivid details of the\n\n8 swirls on the ceiling or the patern on the wallpaper.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the literature and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 techniques, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7264\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007265.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document467_ Filed ll/l5/2l Page 86oofl58 86\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the first time they've ever talked about it.\n\n2 Similarly, through trainings and readings and in my\n\n3 graduate program, also being taught that when you make an\n\n4 assessment it's really important, when someone is talking about\n5 their experiences, to inguire of them what their experiences\n\n6 were like with <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, because that can be so impactful.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they experienced as\n9 children but disclosed such abuse later?\n\nlo A. YSS.\n\nll Q. Can you explain.\n\nl2 A. I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of child sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important questions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\n23 assistance at the time of the event. And that also is highly\n24 relevant.\n25 So I see that a lot in my clinical practice.

The majority of the patients that I work\n7 with who've -—- who've experienced childhood sexual abuse, like\n8 all victims of child sexual abuse, the abuses, a majority that\n9 has occur, most likely will occur in the context of a\n\nlo relationship.

When patients have disclosed that they experienced\n2o childhood sexual abuse to you for the first time, were your\n2l patients adults or children?\n22 A. I would say that when they're making an initial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\n23 for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was\n24 working in an inpatient seting at times I, I certainly worked\n25 with adolescents who had made <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> while they were still\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7266\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007267.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 88ofl58 88\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl kids around the time, so not as much delayed.\n\n2 Q. Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated\n3 and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual\n4 abuse at the time of the abuse?\n\n5 A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one\n6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said\n7 that they told right away. With younger children in\n\n8 particular, we also knou that it's more likely with very young\n9 children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously\nlo go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be\nll accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and\nl2 then inquires, and that's hou that information comes out. But,\nl3 again, we knou that most victims of childhood sexual abuse\nl4 don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time\nl5 after the event, and that's consistent with what I've\nl6 experienced in my practice.\nl7 Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you\nl8 referring to?\nl9 A. We knou that delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> happens over time. But we\n2o also knou that the younger the child, the more likely it is\nal that the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> or the discovery of the abuse happens\n22 accidentally.\n23 Q.

Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7267\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007268.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 467 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 89ofl58 89\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

Hou do the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>-related behaviors you've seen in your\n6 forensic practice compare to those you've seen in your clinical\n7 practice?\n\n8 A. Very similar.

So there's different ways that the literature has looked at\nl5 the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in two\n25 different ways.

There's also research that's been done looking\nll at, again, hou people tell and, you knou, closer in time, not\nl2 just with adults looking back retrospectively, but times when\nl3 there's been —- someone has been knoun to have been abused, and\nl4 there have been studies that have been done looking at, do they\nl5 tell or not.

The government’s motion seeks to unfairly capitalize on this Court’s\ndecision largely overruling Ms. Maxwell’s Daubert challenge to the government’s expert, Dr.\nLisa Rocchio. If the government gets its way, Dr. Rocchio will present the jury with a one-sided\nversion of events while Ms. Maxwell will be crippled in her ability to respond. This Court should\nnot permit the asymmetry the government hopes to create.\n\nThere is no dispute that Drs. Dietz and Loftus are supremely qualified in their respective\nareas of expertise. Atached as Exhibit l is the defense <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the expert opinions of Dr.\nDietz and Dr. Loftus. That 374-page document includes eleven exhibits (Exhibits A — K)\ndescribing the qualifications and bases of the opinions Ms. Maxwell’s experts will offer at trial.\nDr. Dietz is so well-regarded that Dr. Rocchio herself has relied on his opinions, Exhibit 2, p\n58:l-24 (transcript of Nov. lo, 2o2l hearing), and Dr. Loftus all but wrote the book on the\nscience of memory.\n\nUnable to challenge the qualifications of either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus, the government’s\nmotion mischaracterizes their proposed opinions in an effort persuade this Court that they either\ninvade the province of the jury or are unhelpful to the finder of fact. This Court should not fall\nfor the government’s construction of strawmen.\n\nBeyond their responsiveness to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s\nexpert opinions are independently relevant because they will help the jury understand the facts of\nthis case. To the extent the government contends these opinions don’t “fit,” that objection is flat-\nout wrong or at least premature, since the government hasn’t put any evidence on yet. Because\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo747o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007478.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel3 of 28\nlacked actual knouledge of and intent to facilitate the alleged grooming and abuse, she is not\nguilty, even if, as a mater of hindsight, it should have been obvious.\n\nThe government’s second argument falls short as well. Although the phrase “2o/2o\nhindsight” might be well-knoun, the pouer of hindsight bias and the degree to which it might\nunreliably affect the outcome of this case is not. To be sure, as Dr. Dietz laid out in his\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, the scientific literature about hindsight bias is voluminous. Ex. l, p 4-5. These expert\narticles wouldn’t exist if the concept were obvious to everyone, and surely it wouldn’t be the\ncase that, as Dr. Dietz notes, “[e]ven individuals with specialized training and expertise succumb\nto hindsight bias,” id. at 5.\n\nThe government concedes that “the jury, and not the court, should be the one to decide\namong conflicting experts.” Mot. at 9 (quoting United States v. Randall, No. l9 Cr. l3l (PAE)\n(S.D.N.Y.)). But for the jury to do that job, it must be equipped with the necessary tools. And\none of those tools is Dr. Dietz’s perfectly permissible opinion that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony\ncannot carry the water the government wants it to because it is tainted by hindsight bias. See\nUnited States v. Broun, 557 F.2d 54l, 556 (6th Cir. l977) (“Conflicting testimony concerning\nthe conclusions drawn by experts, so long as they are based on a generally accepted and reliable\nscientific principle, ordinarily go to the weight of the testimony rather than to its admissibility.”).\n\nC. The Halo Effect.\n\nThe government has two objections to Dr. Dietz’s opinions on the “halo effect.” The first\nis that it is irrelevant (though, again, not unreliable). The second is that it improperly seeks to\nengender sympathy for Ms. Maxwell.\n\nFirst, the government is wrong to argue the testimony is irrelevant. Take just one\n(representative) example. Dr. Dietz opines that Mr. Epstein’s\n\n9\nDOJ-OGR- oooo7478\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007480.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel5of 28\ntestimony.” (cleaned up)). The government’s speculative concern about the effect of Dr. Dietz’s\ntestimony is no reason to exclude it when the Court has ample tools at its disposal to address the\ngovernments (ill-founded) worries.\n\nAlmost as an aside, the government disingenuously suggests that Dr. Dietz’s opinion is\ninadmissible because “it appears” to be based “solely on one interview of Epstein with Steven\nBannon.” Mot. at l7. As the government well knous, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is based on much\nmore. To be sure, Dr. Dietz quoted the interview in his <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, Ex. l, p 6, but he also\nreviewed and considered thousands of pages of material before reaching his opinion, including\nmost significantly all the material available to him about the Palm Beach Investigations of Mr.\nEpstein, Ex. l, p l66-69.\n\nD. Pathways to False Allegations of Sexual Assault.\n\nThe government misses the mark in its hyperbolic objection to Dr. Dietz’s opinions about\nthe multiple pathways to false sex assault allegations. Mot. at l8-22. The government claims\nthese opinions invade the province of the jury are unreliable and unhelpful. Not so.\n\nFirst, the opinions do not invade the province of the jury because Dr. Dietz is not offering\nan opinion on the truthfulness of the accusers’ allegations in this case. See Nimely v. City of New\nYork, 4l4 F.3d 38l, 395—96 (2d Cir. 2oo5) (expert testimony is inadmissible if it “comment[s]\ndirectly, under the guise of expert opinion, on the credibility of trial testimony from” specific\nfact witnesses.); cf Hygh v. Jacobs, 96l F.2d 359, 364 (2d Cir. l992) (expert not permited to\noffer testimony that “merely [tells] the jury what result to reach’). Dr. Dietz’s opinions rely on\nhis clinical experience and the vast body of literature explaining hou an accuser might come to\nfalsely allege sexual assault.\n\nOne point (but by no means the only one) of Dr. Dietz’s opinion is to challenge the\nreliability of Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, which she bases on the untested assumption that her\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo748o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007481.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Page l6 of 28\npatients are telling the truth when they claim to have been abused. See Ex. l, p 7 (“Studies\nconcerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by\nDr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise\nrelevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient\nallouance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to knou\nhou and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,\nMot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of\ndifferent experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d l64, l73 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo9)\n(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. l37, l53 (l999)).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of\nthe disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admited during her testimony\nat her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not\nsurface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.\nEx. 2, p l53-54.\n\nNor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 2o-2l. First,\nDr. Rocchio essentially admited they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p l53-54.\n\nSecond, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough\n(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his oun\npractice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by\nEngle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the\narticle. See Fed. R. Evid. 7o2, Advisory Commitee Notes, 2ooo Amendments. (“Nothing in this\n[rule] is intended to suggest that experience alone--or experience in conjunction with other\nknouledge, skill, training or education--may not provide a sufficient foundation for expert\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oooo748l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007482.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Pagel7 of 28\ntestimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 7o2 expressly contemplates that an expert may be\nqualified on the basis of experience.”).\n\nThird, in admiting Dr. Rocchio’s testimony over an objection by Ms. Maxwell similar to\nthe one offered here by the government, this Court said as follous:\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)\n\nsuggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms.\n\nMaxwell guilty... . It is the jury’s role to determine whether and hou Dr. Rocchio’s\n\nopinions apply to the facts of this case and the credibility of the witnesses.\n(Dkt. 435, p lo). The same logic applies to Dr. Dietz’s opinions.\n\nFinally, the government says the Dr. Dietz’s opinions don’t “fit the facts of the case.”\nMot. at 2l. But because the accusers’ stories have changed so much over the last twenty years,\nand because it’s still unclear what they will testify to at trial, this objection is premature at best.\nIf the government believes Dr. Dietz’s opinions do not “fit” the facts, this Court can consider that\nargument once there is evidence of what the facts really are.\n\nE. Dr. Dietz’s Alleged Opinions about the Accusers’ “Credibility.”\n\nNouhere in Dr. Dietz’s expert <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> does he propose to opine on the credibility of\nMs. Maxwell’s accusers. Ex. l. The government can argue otherwise only by mischaracterizing\nhis opinions. See Mot. at 22-23.\n\nFor one thing, Dr. Dietz should be able to critique Dr. Rocchio’s methods and\nconclusions by opining that experts in the field would not be “so credulous” as Dr. Rocchio is.\nSee Gov’t Omnibus Resp. to Maxwell Mot. in Limine, at l6; Ex. 2, p l6:ll-l6 (Dr. Rocchio: “In\nmy clinical practice, it’s not — I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It’s not\nmy job to go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear\nwhat they’re telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the\nscientific literature.”). Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that Dr. Rocchio erred in assuming that her\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7482\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007484.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 _ Filed ll/23/2l Pagel9 of 28\n\nFinally, the government points to Dr. Dietz’s “acknouledgement” that credibility should\nbe judged on a “case-by-case basis.” Mot at 23. That is exactly right. And it is exactly what Dr.\nRocchio does not do in her clinical practice, which is one reason why Dr. Dietz’s testimony is\nadmissible.\n\nF. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nDr. Dietz’s opinions on PTSD are relevant, reliable, and admissible.\n\nThe government’s first argument is that it doesn’t understand Dr. Dietz’s proposed\ntestimony, particularly Dr. Dietz’s statement that victims with PTSD symptoms are unlikely “to\nunnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event.” Mot. at 23. To be clear, the point Dr. Dietz was\nmaking in this statement and this paragraph of his <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is that victims with PTSD will\nlikely avoid reminders of the event that caused the trauma in the first place—for example, they\nwill avoid continued communication with the alleged perpetrator and they are unlikely to wear\nclothing provided by the alleged perpetrator. Dr. Dietz is not saying, as the government claims,\nthat victims should bear “responsibility for experiencing repeated assaults.”\n\nAccording to the government, the\n\ncritical distinction in this case involves the difference between victims of sexual\n\nassaults who are involved an ongoing relationship of atachment and coercion with\n\ntheir abusers—including the pouer imbalance arising from the age differential\n\nbetween them and the abusers—and those who are not. To the extent Dr. Dietz’s\n\ntestimony primarily addresses the later category, such an opinion is irrelevant and\nshould be precluded for lack of fit with the facts of the case. . . . To the extent Dr.\n\nDietz intends instead to opine on the former category, that opinion is not reliable.\n\nMot. at 23-24 (citations omited). This argument fails as well.\n\nOn the one hand, the government says Dr. Dietz’s opinion does not “fit the facts” of the\ncase because this case is about alleged “victims of sexual assaults who are involved an ongoing\nrelationship of atachment and coercion with their abusers.” But this argument begs the\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7484\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007489.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499 Filed ll/23/2l Page 24 of 28\ntrauma on memory. The government does not explain hou it can be fair to oppose the testimony\nof an actual memory expert.\n\nAccording to the government, (Dkt. 397), Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about memory is\nproper under Fed. R. Evid. 7o2 because:\n\nSexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances,\n\noften only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may\n\nbe lost. With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol responses in\n\nthe context of fear and trauma cause people to narrou their focus to the most salient\n\nand relevant details. If someone is abused multiple times or by multiple people, it\n\nis very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together, although\n\nthe victim can remember the perpetrator and maybe some of the locations where\n\nthe abuse occurred.\n\nTaken together, Dr. Rocchio’s expert testimony explains why victims of child\n\nsexual abuse—and especially repeated sexual abuse—may disclose their abuse in\n\na delayed and incremental fashion, and why their memories may lack some level of\n\ndetail when the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> finally occurs.\n\nThe validity of these opinions is debatable. What is not, houever, is that these opinions\nare a small part of what may or may not affect someone’s memory over time. The government\ndesperately wants to avoid discussing the other factors that may affect memory such as\nsuggestibility, substance abuse (both short and long term), secondary gain, the effects of time,\npsychological disorders, and confabulation (Dr. Rocchio admited that these things impact\nmemory during the 7o2 hearing). E.g., Ex. 2, p l2l-22.\n\nThese are not topics readily understandable. The government has selected a “trauma”\nexpert who will present only a small, self-serving part of the science related to memory. Experts\nsuch as Dr. Loftus spend a lifetime researching and writing about these concepts which have\nbeen regularly misunderstood by fact finders. One need only to consider the extraordinary\nnumber of innocent people convicted on what was thought to be reliable testimony based on\nfaulty memories of witnesses whose convictions were reversed after DNA evidence proved the\n“memories” incorrect. Jurors do not understand these scientific concepts and will benefit from\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7489\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007495.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page 2 of 375\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.C\nJeffrey S.

EXPERT <span class=\"highlight\">DISCLOSURE</span> BY THE DEFENSE\n\nA. Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nDr. Loftus is the Distinguished Professor of Psychological Science and Law at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine School of Law. Dr. Loftus is one of the nation’s leading experts\non the science of memory. In addition to her experience as an academic and clinical researcher,\nshe has been an expert witness or consultant in hundreds of cases. Her extensive experience and\ncredentials are recited in her curriculum vitae. Exhibit A.\n\nIt is expected that Dr. Loftus, a psychologist who specializes in the study of memory, will\nfocus on the memory aspects of this case. Based on her education, training, experience, and\nresearch, her testimony will concern the workings of human memory, the effects of suggestion\non memory, the mechanism of creation of false memories, the characteristics of false memories,\nhou memory fades and weakens over time, and hou memory becomes more vulnerable to\ncontamination. She will describe scientific research shouing that false memories can be\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7495\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007498.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-l Filed ll/23/2l Page5of 375\nComey, Moe, Pomerantz and Rohrbach\nNovember l, 2o2l\nPage 4\n\nMoreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that\n“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie\nBennet & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7949\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007950.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 82 of l598l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of childhood sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent. To the extent that they are involved\n25 in a sexually abusive relationship with an older person, they\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo795o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007951.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 83 of l5982\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo795l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007952.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 84 of l5983\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\n3 childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is more likely to evolve\n23 over time.\n24 Q. Hou if at all does memory play a role in <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>?\n25 A. So when we're talking about child sexual abuse, when we're\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7952\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007954.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 86 of l5985\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl A. Sure. If we'tre talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the —-— and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations. Alternatively, someone who is dissociating and\n\n6 trying very hard not -- to not think and not atend to what's\n\n7 happening to them, they may have very vivid details of the\n\n8 swirls on the ceiling or the patern on the wallpaper.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the literature and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 techniques, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7954\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007955.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 87 of l5986\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl the first time they've ever talked about it.\n\n2 Similarly, through trainings and readings and in my\n\n3 graduate program, also being taught that when you make an\n\n4 assessment it's really important, when someone is talking about\n5 their experiences, to inguire of them what their experiences\n\n6 were like with <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, because that can be so impactful.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they experienced as\n9 children but disclosed such abuse later?\n\nlo A. YSS.\n\nll Q. Can you explain.\n\nl2 A. I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of child sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important questions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\n23 assistance at the time of the event. And that also is highly\n24 relevant.\n25 So I see that a lot in my clinical practice.

Hou common is delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in the patients you treat\n5 and evaluate in connection with your clinical practice?\n\n6 A. It's very common. The majority of the patients that I work\n7 with who've -—- who've experienced childhood sexual abuse, like\n8 all victims of child sexual abuse, the abuses, a majority that\n9 has occur, most likely will occur in the context of a\n\nlo relationship.

When patients have disclosed that they experienced\n2o childhood sexual abuse to you for the first time, were your\n2l patients adults or children?\n22 A. I would say that when they're making an initial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\n23 for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was\n24 working in an inpatient seting at times I, I certainly worked\n25 with adolescents who had made <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> while they were still\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 89 of l5988\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl kids around the time, so not as much delayed.\n\n2 Q. Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated\n3 and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual\n4 abuse at the time of the abuse?\n\n5 A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one\n6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said\n7 that they told right away. With younger children in\n\n8 particular, we also knou that it's more likely with very young\n9 children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously\nlo go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be\nll accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and\nl2 then inquires, and that's hou that information comes out. But,\nl3 again, we knou that most victims of childhood sexual abuse\nl4 don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time\nl5 after the event, and that's consistent with what I've\nl6 experienced in my practice.\nl7 Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you\nl8 referring to?\nl9 A. We knou that delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> happens over time. But we\n2o also knou that the younger the child, the more likely it is\nal that the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> or the discovery of the abuse happens\n22 accidentally.\n23 Q. Are you aware of other psychologists treating and evaluate\n24 patients who have delay disclosing childhood sexual abuse?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 499-2 Filed ll/23/2l Page 9o of l5989\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\n3 Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, if you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

So there's different ways that the literature has looked at\nl5 the issue of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences. And typically in those\n\nl9 studies, you will ask -- people are asked about their\n2o experiences with rape, sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse.\n2l And so you can get some idea of what percentage of people in\n22 various studies across time report particular events in their\n23 lives. So you get an estimate of prevalence.\n24 You can compare that to look at <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in two\n25 different ways.

There's also research that's been done looking\nll at, again, hou people tell and, you knou, closer in time, not\nl2 just with adults looking back retrospectively, but times when\nl3 there's been —- someone has been knoun to have been abused, and\nl4 there have been studies that have been done looking at, do they\nl5 tell or not.

Child\nSexual Abuse 957, 974 (2ol4).\n\nIn any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those\nwhom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has\noccurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such\njudgments have no knoun error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.\n\nAlthough the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony\nis silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the\nDefendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third\nparties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a\nphenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for\nherself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to\nprovide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.\n\nDr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to\nsupport a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone\ngeneral acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and\ncannot be tested; and there is no knoun or potential rate of error.\n\nDr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted\nby perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the\nfrequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual\nabuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children\nwith varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those\nwith intact families, atentive parents, good social support, litle psychopathology, less prior\ntrauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more\nvulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical\ndata. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that\nabuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so\nmany abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal\njustice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is\nderived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent\ngroups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical\nevidence, or other means.\n\nOther opinions put forth in the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest\non assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no knoun error rate.\n\nb.

Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government\nwitness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full\ncross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634\nF.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. l98l). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction\nbecause the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about\nhis mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a\nwitness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the\njury to knou that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at\nl275.\n\nII. Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.\n\nThe government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only\nto the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 2o. In ruling on the motions in\nlimine, the Court expressly declined to prohibit Ms. Maxwell from challenging the consistency\n\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8lo6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008187.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel5ofl7\ncontaminated over time, hou false memories can be created through suggestive activities, and\nhou alleged victims can testify to false memories they believe to be true. Each of these opinions\nderives from Dr. Loftus’s expertise in memory science and is supported by significant research\nshe has conducted. See Shiraishi, 2ol9 WL l386365, at *4. Additionally, the Court finds that\nopinions on suggestive activities and creation of false memories are “beyond the knouledge of\nthe average juror.” Doe, 2ol8 WL lo64572, at *5 (collecting cases that admited expert\ntestimony on the effects of suggestive questioning of alleged sexual abuse victims). Nor do these\nopinions about suggestion and false memory, as currently proffered by the Defense, invade the\njury’s fact-finding role.

Notice at l. “It is common knouledge that memory fades with time.” United\nStates v. Labansat, 94 F.3d 527, 53o (9th Cir. l996); see also United States v. Welch, 368 F.3d\n97o, 973-75 (7th Cir. 2oo4), judgment vacated on other grounds, 543 U.S. ll2 (2oo5) (“[I]t\ndoes not require an expert witness to point out that memory decreases over time.”); United States\nv.

Nov. l3, 2ol7) (‘{T]hat\nmemories are fallible and may deteriorate over time . . . is within the ken of the ordinary juror.”).\nIt is therefore inadmissible as expert testimony. Mulder, 273 F.3d at lol.\n\nSecond, the notice of Dr. Loftus’s expert testimony refers three times to Dr. Loftus’s\nexpected testimony on “the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case.” Notice at 2\n(emphasis added). The Court would preclude such testimony on the specific facts of this case\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008188.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6 Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel6ofl7\nbecause an expert witness may not “simply transmit . . . hearsay to the jury” or otherwise serve\nas a vehicle for the factual history of the case. United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d l79, l97 (2d Cir.\n2oo8); see In re Fosamax, 645 F. Supp. 2d at l92. Testifying as to specific suggestive activities\nwould also likely violate the rule against expert testimony on specific witnesses’ credibility.\nNimely, 4l4 F.3d at 398.\n\nBut in its response brief, the Defense states that “[l]ike Dr. Rocchio, [Dr. Loftus] would\nbe testifying as a ‘blind’ expert” and so will not testify about any particular witness in this case.\nDef. Br. at l7. Based on this representation, the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s opinion on the\ngeneral concepts of suggestive activities and false memory creation. The Defense may on cross-\nexamination ask witnesses about activities or events that the Defense believes led to false\nmemories. And the jury may then determine whether the general concepts in Dr. Loftus’s\nopinions are applicable to the evidence before it.\n\nLast, the Court clarifies that this decision as to Dr. Loftus is by no means an invitation for\nmemory experts to be admited in every future case. As other federal courts have observed,\nexpert testimony of this type is relevant only in unusual circumstances. See Carter, 4lo F.3d at\n95o; United States v. Redwood, 2l6 F. Supp. 3d 89o, 899 (N.D.

The Court finds this case to be one such unusual\ncircumstance, both because of the long period of time that has elapsed since the charged conduct\nand because of the public atention that conduct has received. Important, too, is that the Court\nhas admited the Government’s expert, Dr. Rocchio, who expects to testify on delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008189.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel7ofl7\nof sexual abuse. That testimony partially opens the door to memory-based explanations for the\nalleged victims’ later disclosures of abuse.\nIV.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 2o Cr. 33o (AJN)\nDear Judge Nathan:\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this leter in response to the question whether the\ndefense is required to disclose exhibits they intend to introduce into evidence through Government\nwitnesses as “impeachment.” While the defendant need not disclose exhibits being introduced\nsolely for impeachment, the defendant may not circumvent Rule l6’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> requirements by\ndescribing defense exhibits as being used for impeachment when in fact they are properly\nconsidered part of the defendant’s case in chief. Further, the introduction of extrinsic evidence for\nthe purpose of impeachment is narrouly circumscribed, as set forth belou.\n\nRule l6(b) expressly requires <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of items the defense “intends to use . . . in the\ndefendant’s case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A). The defendant’s “case in chief”\nis not a formalist term for the events that begin the moment the Government rests. Rather, “where\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008191.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l7 Filed ll/3o/2l Page2of4\na defendant cross-examines a government witness to butress her theory of the case, rather than to\nimpeach the testimony given by the witness on direct examination, the cross-examination is\nproperly seen as part of the defendant’s case-in-chief.” United States v. Napout, No. l5 Cr. 252\n(PKC), 2ol7 WL 6375729, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. l2, 2ol7) (quoting United States v. Hsai, No. 98\nCr. 75 (PLF), 2ooo WL l95o67, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. l2, 2ooo)) (alterations and internal quotation\nmarks omited). “[T]his interpretation of Rule l6 has been adopted by almost every district court\nto consider the issue.” /d. (collecting cases); see United States v. Young, 248 F.3d 26o, 269 (4th\nCir. 2ool) (affirming exclusion of evidence offered through cross-examination as part of the\ndefense’s “evidence in chief,” under the prior language of Rule l6, due to the defense’s failure to\ndisclose). Accordingly, the rule “requires [the defense] to identify all non-impeachment exhibits\nthey intend to use in their defense at trial, whether the exhibits will be introduced through a\ngovernment witness or a witness called by [the defense].” Napout, 2ol7 WL 6375729, at *7. The\nreasoning is simple: a contrary rule would “permit defendants to evade pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> simply\nby presenting much (or all) of their case-in-chief before the government rests,” thereby\n“frustrat[ing| the practical intentions behind Rule l6: to avoid unfair surprise and unwarranted\ndelay by providing both the government and the defense with a broad, reciprocal right to\ndiscovery.” United States v. Crouder, 325 F. Supp. 3d l3l (Mem.) (D.D.C. Sept. 24, 2ol8).\n\nThe defendant’s Rule l6 disclosures were due on November 8, 2o2l. (Dkt. No. 297 at 2).\nAccordingly, any exhibits which the defense intends to offer as part of its case-in-chief, whether\nthrough Government witnesses or its oun, should have been disclosed at that time. The\nGovernment of course understands that there are circumstances in which intervening event may\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008192.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l7 Filed ll/3o/2l Page3of4\ngive rise to good cause for a belated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.! Absent such a shouing, houever, new defense\nexhibits should be precluded or, at a minimum, ordered to be disclosed forthwith.\n\nTo the extent the defense anticipates offering exhibits for impeachment, as a general mater,\n“extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to\natack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness.” Fed. R. Evid. 6o8(b). This rule is\nsubject to certain exceptions. For instance, as the parties agreed this afternoon, extrinsic evidence\nof a witness’s prior statement is not barred by Rule 6o8. Fed. R. Evid. 6l3. The Rules also permit\n“other grounds of impeachment (such as contradiction, prior inconsistent statement, bias, and\nmental capacity).” United States v. Johnson, 469 F. Supp. 3d l93, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (quoting\nFed. R. Evid. 6o8(b) Advisory Commitee Notes). But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered\nfor impeachment on a collateral issue is properly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, l44 F.3d 24l,\n245-46 (2d Cir. l998); see United Sates v. Dore, No. l2 Cr. 45 (RJS), 2ol3 WL 396528l, at *6\n(S.D.N.Y. July 3l, 2ol3) (Sullivan, J.)

Accordingly, the defense may offer\nextrinsic evidence for impeachment, if the defense articulates an appropriate exception to the\ngeneral prohibition on such evidence described above.\n\n‘To be clear, good cause is not established simply because the defense has not made a final\ndetermination as to what evidence they intend to introduce—a position that effectively renders\nRule l6 a nullity.

The government says that Ms. Maxwell did not disclose the photograph as part of her\nreciprocal discovery obligations, thereby violating Rule l6(b)(l)(A). The government is wrong.\n\nThe language of Rule l6(b)(l)(A) is plain and unambiguous: Its reciprocal discovery\nobligations apply only to material Ms. Maxwell intends to use during her “case-in-chief.” The\nRule says:\n\n(b) Defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>.\n\n(l) Information Subject to <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>.\n(A) Documents and Objects. If a defendant requests <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nunder Rule l6(a)(l)(E) and the government complies, then the\ndefendant must permit the government, upon request, to inspect and\nto copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs,\ntangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of\nthese items if:\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l94\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008196.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l8 Filed ll/3o/2l Page3of8\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\nNovember 3o, 2o2l\nPage 3\n\nCases hold the same. E.g., United States v. Medearis, 38o F.3d lo49, lo57 (8th Cir.\n2oo4) (Rule l6(b)(l)(A) does not require defense to disclose evidence he does “not seek to use . .\n. in his case-in-chief”); United States v. Moore, 2o8 F.3d 577, 579 (7th Cir. 2ooo) (Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A) does not require defense to disclose evidence used to impeach “the testimony of a\nwitness for the prosecution,” because that is not evidence introduced in a defendant’s “‘case-in-\nchief”).!\n\nAs Judge Easterbrook recognized, the government’s contrary argument in this case\n“sorely misunderstands what it means to offer ‘evidence in chief? (or evidence in one’s ‘case in\nchief’).” Moore, 2o8 F.3d at 579. In fact, so obviously wrong is the government’s interpretation\nof Rule l6 that, when the government offered the same argument in United States v. Moore,\nJudge Easterbrook concluded that the district court commited a plain error in excluding a leter\nthe defense offered into evidence while cross-examining a prosecution witness during the\ngovernment’s case-in-chief. /d.\n\nThe government is also wrong to suggest that even if Ms. Maxwell did not have to\ndisclose statements used as impeachment while cross-examining a prosecution witness during\nthe government’s case-in-chief, she did have to disclose other exhibits used as impeachment,\nsuch as the photograph she offered into evidence while cross-examining Jane. Under Rule l6(b)\n\n‘Nor does Rule l6(b)(l)(A) apply to material a defendant uses to refresh a witness’s\nrecollection while cross-examining her during the government’s case-in-chief. United States v.\nGray-Burriss, 79l F.3d 5o, 57-58 & n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2ol5) (using documents to refresh\nrecollection of government’s witnesses not covered by Rule l6); United States v.

Ms. Maxwell can impeach a prosecution witness’s testimony with any\nadmissible exhibit. The decision in United States v. Hatfield makes this clear.\n\nIn Hatfield, the government sought a Rule l6(b)(l)(A) order compelling the defendant to\ndisclose six categories of evidence:\n\n(l) the Tactical Armor Products, Inc. computers and servers, as described in the\n\ntestimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (2) all computers of DHB Industries, Inc.,\n\nas described in the testimony of Rex Harris on June 3, 2oo8; (3) all computers\n\npersonally used by and/or issued to David H.

Hatfield, No. o6-CR-o55o, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2oo9).\nThe district court refused the government’s request, as should this Court. As Judge Seybert\nexplained:\n\nBecause [the defendant] will not be using these items to support his case in chief,\n\n[he] is not required to disclose the items under Rule l6....\n\nThe Court rejects the Government’s argument that [the defendant] is\nrequired to turn over the above documents pursuant to Rule l6 because [the\ndefendant] may use the items to impeach Government witnesses. Rule l6 mandates\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any documents and tangible objects that the defendant will use in his\ncase-in-chief, and not items which the defendant will use to impeach witnesses.\n\nHatfield, 2oo9 WL lo6736l9, at *l-2 (citing Medearis & Moore) (full citations omited).

Prohibiting a party from introducing the evidence is the most extreme sanction\navailable, and it requires proof that the belated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> prejudiced the government.

First, the atorney-client privilege\ndoes not apply to Mr. Glassman’s statement to Jane that cooperating and testifying would “help\nher case.” Second, even if the privilege did apply, it was waived when Mr. Glassman relayed his\nstatement to the government. Ex. l (35o9-o22).\n\n“The atorney-client privilege protects from <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> (l) a communication between\nclient and counsel that (2) was intended to be and was in fact kept confidential, and (3) was made\nfor the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.” Jn re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 4l3, 4l9\n(2d Cir. 2oo7). “The burden of establishing the atorney-client privilege, in all its elements,\nalways rests upon the person asserting it.” United States v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237, 244 (2d\nCir. l989). In this case, the party asserting the privilege is the government on behalf of Jane.\n\nThe government has not met its burden. Mr. Glassman’s statement to Jane that her\ncooperation and testimony would “help her case” is not protected by the atorney-client privilege\nbecause “it was [not] intended to be .. . kept confidential.” Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9.

Jan. 2o2o update). Jane’s\nmotivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms. Maxwell is essential\nto the government’s assessment of Jane’s credibility and its preparation for her cross-\nexamination.\n\nPredictably, then, Mr. Glassman shared with the government the advice he gave to Jane,\nso the information was not “in fact kept confidential.” See Erie, 473 F.3d at 4l9; see also United\nStates v. Bergonzi, 2l6 F.R.D. 487, 494 (N.D. Cal. 2oo3) (addressing assertion of atorney-client\nprivilege in respect to documents sought by the defendant in a criminal case and holding that\nprivilege did not apply because there was no evidence “the Company intended the\ncommunications to remain confidential, as it must have in order for the privilege to apply in the\nfirst instance” and because “the Company failed to meet its burden of persuading the Court that\nthe atorney-client privilege applies to the documents sought by Defendants”). The atorney-\nclient privilege thus does not apply.\n\nBut even if the privilege did apply, the privilege was waived. “It is well-established that\nvoluntary <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of confidential material to a third party generally results in forfeiture of any\napplicable atorney-client privilege.” United States v. Ghavami, 882 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol2). That is exactly what happened here. Mr. Glassman voluntarily communicated\nwith the government that he advised Jane to cooperate with the government because it would\n“help her case,” thereby waiving the atorney-client privilege. And as Fed. R. Evid. 5o2(a)\nrecognizes, “[w]hen the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> [of confidential information] is made in a federal proceeding\nor to a federal office,” that generally “waives the atorney-client privilege or work-product\n\nDOJ-OGR- oooo82o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document52l Filed l2/o3/2l Page4of5\nThe Honorable Alison J.

V, VI.

Nov. l Tr. at 6. That motion was granted for two primary\nreasons. First, the Court has a statutory duty to protect an alleged crime victim’s “right to be\ntreated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” l8 U.S.C. §\n377l(a)(8). Nov. l Tr. at 6-7. Because of the “sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct\nalleged” the Court found that pseudonyms were necessary to protect that right. /d. at 8. Second,\nif alleged victims of abuse were subject to publicity, harassment, and embarrassment, “other\nalleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from coming forward” to report abuse. Jd. The\nCourt emphasized that the Government’s proposal is “quite common” among courts in this\ncircuit, citing six such cases. /d. at 7-8. As a consequence of protecting alleged victims, the\nCourt further permited pseudonyms for several witnesses that were not alleged victims\nthemselves “because the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of\nthe alleged victims.” /d. at 8.\n\nThese reasons for granting the Government’s prior motion do not apply to the Defense’s\npresent request. Based on the current proffer, none of the Defense’s witnesses intend to testify to\nsensitive personal topics or sexual conduct. Rather, they all are anticipated to deny misconduct\nby Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and therefore do not qualify as victims under § 377l. Further,\nthere is no similar concern, as there are for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that denying the use\nof pseudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.\n\nIt is notable that the Defense does not cite in support of its motion a single case in which\na court granted the use of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. Neither does the Government. And\nnor could the Court after significant independent research. It appears, then, that the Defense’s\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8388\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008391.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document548- Filed l2/l5/2l Page5of6\n\nFourth, the Defense argues that a pseudonym is justified for one witness because, under\nthe Government’s theory of the case, she is a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein. There are at\nleast two problems with this justification. First, based on the Defense’s current explanation of\nthis witness’s anticipated testimony, this witness will testify that she was not the target of any\nsexual misconduct by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. She would therefore fall outside the scope of the\nCrime Victims’ Rights Act, which defines a victim as “a person directly and proximately harmed\nas a result of the commission of a Federal offense.” l8 U.S.C. § 377l(e)(2)(A). Though the\nAct’s definition of victim is “expansive,” the Defense has not identified a way in which this\nwitness was harmed, “whether physically, financially, psychologically, or otherwise” by an\noffense allegedly commited by Ms. Maxwell. United States v. Ray, 337 F.R.D. 56l, 57o\n(S.D.N.Y. 2o2o); see also In re Ippolito, 8ll F. App’x 795, 797 (3d Cir. 2o2o) (“[O]ne does not\nacquire status under the CVRA based on his oun say-so.”). Second, and relatedly, the Court\nunderstands that this witness will testify that sexual conduct did not occur. Consequently, the\ntestimony does not raise the same risks of embarrassment or harassment as did the other\nwitnesses’ testimony, nor does it risk deterring alleged victims of sexual abuse from coming\nforward in future cases. The Court therefore rejects this basis for permiting testimony under a\npseudonym.\n\nThe Defense’s fifth argument is that the Court permited two non-alleged victims to\ntestify under pseudonyms, which justifies permiting its witnesses to do the same. But as the\nCourt explained, it permited two non-victims to testify under pseudonym only “because the\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the alleged victims.” Nov.\nl Tr. at 8. The Defense has not identified any similar dynamic here.\n\nLast, the Court emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense’s motion, the\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo839l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 549-l Filed l2/l7/2l Page 5of 24 l7\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl Fourth, the confrontation clause of the Sixth\n\n2 Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to\n\n3 meaningful cross-examination of government witnesses at trial.\n4 United States v.

It has come to the atention of the\ndefense that one of the twelve jurors in this case (the “Juror”) has been giving oral and videotaped\ninterviews to various members of the press concerning the jury deliberations. These interviews\nhave been publicly reported in several media outlets.' Among other things, the Juror told\nreporters that he disclosed to the other members of the jury during deliberations that he was a\nvictim of sexual abuse and further described his memory of those events. According to the Juror,\nhis <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> influenced the deliberations and convinced other members of the jury to convict Ms.\nMaxwell.\n\n! See Lucia Osborne-Crouley, “‘They were all believable’: Maxwell juror says jury was convinced by accusers’\naccounts of a patern of abuse,” The Independent (Jan. 4, 2o22); Laura Collins and Daniel Bates, “Ghislaine was a\npredator as guilty as Epstein’: Maxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex trafficker and reveals his\noun abuse ordeal,” Daily Mail (Jan. 5, 2o22), available at htps:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\nlo37ol93/Ghislaine-Maxwell-juror-says-evidence-convinced-panel-predator.html; Luc Cohen, “Some Ghislaine\nMaxwell jurors initially doubted accusers, juror says,” Reuters (Jan. 5, 2o22).\n2o7o3ol.l\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008812.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document574 Filed ol/lo/22 Page2of3\ndismiss the severed perjury counts at the time of sentencing, in light of the victims’ significant\ninterests in bringing closure to this mater and avoiding the trauma of testifying again.\n\nIf any of the defendant’s post-trial motions are granted, the Government proposes that the\nparties be directed to promptly confer and propose a schedule for further proceedings. That\nschedule may depend on the manner in which the Court resolves such motions.\n\nDefense Position\n\nThe defense requests that the Court delay seting a schedule for sentencing because there\nis a compelling basis for the Court to overturn Ms. Maxwell’s conviction and grant her a new trial\nbased on the disclosures of Juror #5o during deliberations. The parties are currently briefing that\nissue. The defense therefore objects to seting a schedule for sentencing until this motion is\nresolved. For the same reason, the defense intends to set forth in its moving papers the reasons\nwhy Ms. Maxwell should not be forced to expend resources to brief other post-trial motions until\nafter the Court decides this motion.\n\nFurthermore, requiring Ms. Maxwell to participate in the preparation of the Presentence\nInvestigation Report, while she is awaiting a decision on her motion for a new trial, will adversely\nimpact her Fifth Amendment rights. Ms. Maxwell will be forced into the position of not\ncooperating with the Probation Department’s investigation because any statement she makes to\nProbation, and any documents she provides, may be used against her at her retrial.\n\nZz\nDOJ-OGR-oooo88l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008833.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document583_ Filed ol/25/22 Pagelof5\nThe New York Times\nCompany\nSenior Vice President &\nDeputy General Counsel\nT 2l2 556 4o3l\nVIA EMAIL AND FEDEX\nmecraw@nytimes.com\n62o 8th Avenue The Honorable Alison J.

Additionally, allouing Juror 5o to intervene will\nassist this Court in determining hou to conduct an appropriate inquiry into the subject, by\nallouing his an opportunity to fully and fairly brief the Court on the relevant issues. Moreover,\nthe interests of justice and judicial economy will be served if Juror 5o is permited to intervene at\nthis point in time, as the same will allou Juror 5o to identify and assert any fifth amendment\nrights against self-incrimination before any hearing is held pursuant to an inquiry directed by the\nCourt.\nA. Juror 5o’s Request to Intervene\nl. Jurors have compelling and legitimate privacy rights.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has explicitly acknouledged that Jurors can have\n“compelling” and “legitimate” privacy interests that warrants sealing the record as to certain\nstatements given by the jurors. Press-Enter. Co. v Superior Ct. of California, Riverside County,\n464 US 5ol, 5ll-l2 (l984)-. In Press-Enter. Co., the Supreme Court expressly determined that\nforcing an individual to disclose details of a sexual assault may justify holding closed hearings\nand sealing the record due to “the embarrassment and emotional trauma from the very <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof the episode”. /d. In Press-Enter. Co., Chief Justice Burger further made clear that forced\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of past sexual assault suffered by jurors gave rise to a “valid privacy right”. /d.\n\nIn United States v. King, the Second Circuit upheld the ruling by the louer court, which\nalloued parts of the record in that case to be sealed based on the jurors’ privacy interest in\nintensely personal subjects, as well as upheld the louer court’s finding that such interest was\nheightened by the intense media scrutiny King atracted from the press. United States v King, l4o\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- oooo8986\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00008990.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document6o9_ Filed o2/24/22 Pagellofl3\nBe The instance mater presents a compelling reason to release\nthe Jury Questionnaire to Counsel, under seal.\n\nTo the extent Juror 5o’s privacy interest would normally prevent <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, those factors\ndo not apply to the release of the Jury Questionnaire and the voir dire transcript, under seal, to\nhis oun atorney. Such a release will allou Juror 5o to comply with Judge Nathan’s Order from\nJanuary o5, 2o22. Additionally, since the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript will remain\nunder seal, with the limited expectations requested herein, this Court need not be concerned\nabout the risks that may be posed by full <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the same, and therefore does not need to\nconsider the risks of widespread <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in deciding the instant motion.\n\nWhile the court was right to seal the Jury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript from the\npublic given the circumstances of the trial, the circumstances have changes since that time. Nou\nthat the Jury Questionnaire of Juror 5o specifically is at issue, Juror 5o’s atorney should be\ngranted access to the document under seal. The privacy concerns that favor limiting access to the\nJury Questionnaire and voir dire transcript by others do not apply to Juror 5o himself, given his\nunique involvement and personal role in the inquiry directed by the order of this Court. As such,\nthe balancing of the relevant factors strongly supports granting Juror 5o access to his oun Jury\nQuestionnaire and the transcript of his voir dire testimony, under seal, especially in light of the\nunique facts and circumstance presented by this mater.\n\nIV.

Although Juror 5o has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this\ncase, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case. This is a recognition of\nthe general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or\nnonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v.

Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully\narticulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be\ndenied. For purposes of the issue concerning maintaining the seal on public access, discovery\nrequests are not “judicial documents.” United States v. Smith, 985 F.

Here, for example, Juror 5o’s social media posts expressed appreciation for the\nstatements of gratitude he received for bravely telling his personal story of abuse and convicting\nMs. Maxwell. With so many advocacy groups demanding that victim witnesses be “believed,”\njurors may fear condemnation, or worse, if they acquit. Follouing the acquital of the officers who\nbeat Rodney King, for example, riots took place in Los Angeles and jurors received death threats.°\n\nTo counter the heightened concern with juror bias in high-profile, sensational trials,\nNACDL believes that courts must vigorously protect the integrity of this process on the front end,\nthrough questionnaires and extensive voir dire, and on the back end by refusing to allou a\nconviction where a juror, by his false answers to core questions relating to his ability to be fair,\nhas impaired the Court’s ability to exclude biased jurors from the panel.\n> See, e.g., Believing In The Truth (2ol2) (book by juror in trial of polo mogul John Goodman);\nHung Jury: The Diary Of A Menendez Juror (2ol8); We, The Jury: Deciding The Scot Peterson\nCase (2oo7) (book writen by seven of Scot Peterson’s jurors); Madame Foreman: A Rush To\nJudgment (l996) (book by three O.J.

The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United\nStates, 43o U.S. l88, l93 (l977) (determining court’s holding by reference to concurring opinions\nonly “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices”).

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty.

(This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions.

The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 4o7 F.2d l33o, l33o-3l (2d Cir. l969).

When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo92lo\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009238.jpg": "Case 2o5l-oo88o; PAEumBmctien en O34 Fileddz/24/22agePagee 36 of 67\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, vy\n\nPAUL M.

My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,\nLaw, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)\n: regularly since l978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:\n. Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9447\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009449.jpg": "Case ede eteielemeaiay Nar <7 | Saeenaeeaeeie eel as\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 3 of 29\nmade to the tribunal by the lawyer; (2) fail to disclose to the tribunal controlling\nlegal authority knoun to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the\nclient and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or (3) offer or use evidence that the\nlawyer knous to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by\nthe lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to knou of its\nfalsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if\nnecessary, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see {l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9449\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009450.jpg": "Case (2oeN8oGRB PAgcun Bot Gmentl6l 6622o lRildd) 8ANBA 2P ag Peyef SB of ll7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary. New York,\nlike most (but not all) jurisdictions, has adopted Rules 3.3 (a) and (b) in identical or substantially\n2 | was the expert for Doe in the Connecticut disciplinary hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009451.jpg": "Case lf2aser4oo33o& ABcurDecupreat 6l69/2o Filed Gea Pagkage $2 of ll7\nA-5847\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 5 of 29\nidentical form’ and it has also adopted Rule 3.5(d). These rules mandate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain\ninformation to a court even if <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n 3See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). in my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a\nlawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).\nDOJ-OGR-oooo945l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009452.jpg": "Case lf2aser4oo33o& ABcurDecupreat 6l69/2o Filed Gea Pagkage $3 of ll7\nA-5848\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 6 of 29\nDISCUSSION\nEvents in March 2oll\nl5. | The Brune & Richard lawyers had no duty to reveal to the court Trzaskoma’s discovery\nof a 2olo court order suspending a Bronx lawyer with the same name as juror Conrad. None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim.

Seldin, 422 U.S. 49o, 498, (l975)). Striking the\npleading of a putative litigant is appropriate where the litigant lacks standing. United\nStates v.

The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,\nthis is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must shou\nboth that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis\nfor the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 8l6 (emphasis in original). Because the\ndefendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of\ndishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.\n\nIn so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is\nmandated when the correct <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of\nthe juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 8l5 (quotation omited). As\nthe Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior\ndecision in United States v. Langford, 99o F.2d 65 (2d Cir. l993). Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5. Here,\nthe defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was\nexplicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 4l F.3d at 8l5, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.\n\nThe defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no beter.\nJustice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That\nopinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United\nStates, 43o U.S. l88, l93 (l977) (determining court’s holding by reference to concurring opinions\nonly “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys\nthe assent of five Justices”). And to the extent those concurrences may be considered in construing\nthe holding of McDonough, they were clearly available to the Second Circuit when it did so in\n8 While the vote count is not always clearly listed on Westlaw or other legal research sites, the\nofficial version in the U.S. Reports indicates as much.

For all the\nreasons given in the motion and elaborated belou, this Court should reject the government’s\natempt to cripple Ms. Maxwell’s vindication of her constitutional right to a trial by a fair and\nimpartial jury.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe government’s response relies heavily on the fact that several potential jurors who\nadmited to being victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or harassment were not excluded for\ncase. That is nothing but misdirection.\n\nThose potential jurors admited to being victims of conduct nothing like the alleged\nconduct in this case.

Resp. at 4-5.\n\nJuror No. 5o, by contrast, has nou admited to being the victim of child sexual abuse—\nthe very same conduct at issue in this case. And he has also admited to responding to that abuse\nin much the same way the alleged victims in this case responded—delaying <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, relying\non memories that can be replayed like a video, etc. This Court should not be misled by the\ngovernment’s misleading comparisons.\n\n* United States v.

The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers\nabout those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors\nand eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the\njuror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly\naggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by\nthe juror as a child.\n\nThe Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors\non this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the writen\nquestionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential\njurors who did not tell the truth:\n\nI will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,\n\nI feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be\n\na summary voir dire; it will be probing. . . . Ifa juror’s going to lie and be dishonest,\n\nwe will smoke that out.\n\nTr. lo/2l/2l Hrg. at 26:l2.\n\nAlthough given multiple opportunities to identify himself as a victim of child sexual\nabuse, Juror No. 5o failed to truthfully respond to very clear and pointed questions such as “were\nyou the victim of a crime” and specifically, whether\n\nHave you or a friend or family member [have] ever been the victim of sexual\n\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or atempted\n\nsexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,\n\nacquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)\n\nHad Juror No. 5o truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately\nchallenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the\nunlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 5o would have been questioned, in camera,\n4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo9878\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009889.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document644_ Filed o3/ll/22 Page 2o of 32\n\nQuestion 48 was not confusing or complicated and, again, there is no credible\nexplanation for why the victim of a sexual assault, in a case about sexual assault, would not have\ntaken a long look at that question. The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t\nunderstand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by\ncourts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by\nomission.\n\nFor example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about\nassets or ounership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s\npetition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason\nfor the false answer. Houever, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily\non the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio\nv. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 4o7 F.2d l33o, l33o-3l (2d Cir. l969). See also United States v.\nStone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. l96o) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed financial\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need of going further”). When a\nfalse-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are\nskeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as\nserious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 4o7 F.2d\nat l33o-3l.\n\nIn a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to\nwhich the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 5o’s false answers as nothing but an\ninnocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo9889\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00009917.jpg": "Cas6 2k OCs PAB name r= ate FRO LSA Pa Peeper sib.

My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,\nLaw, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)\n: regularly since l978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:\n. Problems of Law and Ethics (9\" ed. 2ol2). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of\nlegal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association\nmeetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in\nthe United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;\nethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours\nyearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 2o/2o\nCommission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in\nlight of globalization and advance in technology. I have writen widely in the area, including for\nlaw journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic\nresearch. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.\nQuestion Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion\n2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February l6, 2ol2 —\nnamely, “whether the atorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this mater would have satisfied\ntheir ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 2l leter and their\ncomplete investigation into Juror No. l.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’\npossible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> duty in\nMarch, May, and July of 2oll. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol26\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010128.jpg": "Cees PAROAP ORE DARN ema War <-¥ l FiSHORS PAPO ab ate e OS6F difll/l 7\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 3 of 29\nmade to the tribunal by the lawyer; (2) fail to disclose to the tribunal controlling\nlegal authority knoun to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the\nclient and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or (3) offer or use evidence that the\nlawyer knous to be false. If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by\nthe lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to knou of its\nfalsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if\nnecessary, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence,\nother than the testimony of a defendant in a criminal mater, that the lawyer\nreasonably believes is false.\n(b) A lawyer who represents a client before a tribunal and who knous that a\nperson intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent\nconduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures,\nincluding, if necessary, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the tribunal.\n8. Also relevant is New York Rule 3.5(d), which provides: |\nA lawyer shall reveal promptly to the court improper conduct by a member\nof the venire or a juror, or by another touard a member of the venire or a juror or a\nmember of his or her family of which the lawyer has knouledge.\n9. Each of these rules requires knouledge on the part of the lawyer, and that knouledge\nmust be “actual” knouledge. The standard is a subjective one. New York Rule l.o(k) contains\nthis definition:\n_ Knouingly, knoun, knou, or knous denotes actual knouledge of\nthe fact in question. A person’s knouledge may be inferred from circumstances. !\nlo. A leading Second Circuit case addresses the knouledge requirement. In Doe v. Federal\nGrievance Commitee, 847 F.2d 57 (2™ Cir. l988), a district judge in Connecticut disciplined a\nlawyer who did not report his belief that an opposing witness had lied in a deposition. The\nConnecticut (and the New York) rule at the time required a “lawyer who receives information\nclearly establishing that...[a] person other than his client has perpetrated a fraud upon a tribunal\n* | have also been asked to address the potential relevance of Rule 8.4(d) of the New York Rules, which\nsays that a “lawyer or law firm shall not...engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice.” This rule should not be read to expand Rule 3.3’s mens rea\nrequirement of knouledge. When the New York Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted to\nreplace the Code of Professional Responsibility, the courts chose the standard of “knouledge,”\nthe same standard as in the ABA Model Rules, to replace “clearly established,” which the Second\nCircuit had already interpreted to mean “knouledge” (see l lo-ll infra). When a specific and\nconsidered rule requires knouledge, another and general rule should not be interpreted to\nimpose a duty based on a louer standard. There would be obvious notice and fairness interests\nimplicated in doing so. ;\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol28\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010129.jpg": "CaesPACOAB OES DARN l Remar iGAaee O FSS DAP ab atene l36 afl 7\nA-5846\nCase l:o9-cr-oo58l-WHP Document 522 Filed o4/o6/l2 Page 4 of 29\nshall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.” Jd. at 6l (emphasis added)(quoting DR 7-\nlo2(B)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility). The district judge concluded that Doe had\n“qnformation clearly establishing” deposition perjury because he had “clear and convincing\nevidence of [the] witness’s perjury.” Jd. Doe himself testified that “he believed that [the] witness\nhad lied at the deposition.” Id. at 59.\nll. Without rejecting the louer court’s factual finding that Doe had clear and convincing\nevidence of fraud on the tribunal, the Doe Court held that “clearly establishing” required more. It\nheld that “knouledge is required before the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> duty arises.” Jd at 62. Clear and\nconvincing proof, which is an objective test, did not trigger a reporting duty. That a lawyer\n“strongly suspected” fraud on the tribunal (a subjective test) was also insufficient. Jd. at 63. As\nthe Court noted: ,\n_ Our experience indicates that if any standard less than actual knouledge was adopted in\nthis context [i.e., DR 7-lo2(B)(2)], serious consequences might follou. If atorneys were\nbound as part of their ethical duties to report to the court each time they strongly\nsuspected that a witness lied, courts would be inundated with such reports. Court dockets\nwould quickly become overburdened with conducting these collateral proceedings which\nwould necessarily hold up the ultimate disposition of the underlying action. We do not\nbelieve that the Code's drafters intended to throu the court system into such a morass.\nInstead, it seems that the only reasonable conclusion is that the drafters intended\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of only that information which the atorney reasonably knous to be a fact and\nwhich, when combined with other facts in his knouledge, would clearly establish the\nexistence of a fraud on the tribunal.\nTo interpret the rule to-:mean otherwise would be to require atorneys to disclose mere\nsuspicions of fraud which are based upon incomplete information or information which\n. _ may fall short of clearly establishing the existence of a fraud. We do not suggest,\n\n' houever, that by requiring that the atorney have actual knouledge of a fraud before he is\nbound to disclose it, he must wait until he has proof beyond a moral certainty that fraud\nhas been commited. Rather, we simply conclude that he must clearly knou, rather than\nsuspect, that a fraud on the court has been commited before he brings this knouledge to\nthe court's atention.\n\nId. Discipline was reversed.”\nl2. In an adversary legal system like ours, mandatory <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> rules, which operate as a\ncheck on the premises of that system, receive scrutiny and debate from the courts and the bar\nover their proper scope. Furthermore, American jurisdictions do not all agree on hou to\nreconcile competing interests — those of the client, the tribunal, and the adversary. New York,\nlike most (but not all) jurisdictions, has adopted Rules 3.3 (a) and (b) in identical or substantially\n2 | was the expert for Doe in the Connecticut disciplinary hearing.\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol29\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010130.jpg": "CaSas i2o2 Or RCRGeD AS NL Dement Ge?

These rules mandate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain\ninformation to a court even if <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and\nRule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See\nNew York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knouledge.”\nl3. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and\nduties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24\nCir. 2oo3) was an appeal of Rule ll sanctions. When a party seeks Rule ll sanctions, the target\nof the motion has a 2l-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged\nsubmission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule ll sanctions is\nobjective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 9o. When, houever, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,\nas by order to shou cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,\nPennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual\nknouledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course\nof representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”\nId. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.\nat 9l.\nl4. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our\n“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in\nethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are writen with\nappreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their\nadversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.\nDodson, 454 U.S. 3l2 (l98l):\nWithin the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a\npersonal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”\nBut the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue\nof being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the\nmeaning of § l983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the\ndesignated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will\nultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense\nlawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but\nrather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”\nId. at 3l8 (footnotes omited). The question I turn to nou is whether lawyers from Brune &\nRichard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by\nnot disclosing certain information prior to their July 2l, 2oll, leter to the Court.\n- 3 See htp://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/ migrated/cpr/pic/3_3.authcheckdam.pdf (last\nvisited April 5, 2ol2).\n“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). In my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a\nlawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).\nDOJ-OGR-ooolol3o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010131.jpg": "Cadac i2o2 Or ener keep AS SL eminent G52?

None of\nthe lawyers had knouledge that the Bronx lawyer and juror Conrad were the same person. None\neven had “clear and convincing” evidence or “strongly suspected” — the objective and subjective\ntests Doe rejected — they were the same person. Trzaskoma and Brune (who was told of the\ndiscovery though not shoun the suspension order that Trzaskoma discovered but did not print)\nresolved to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those answers, including juror Conrad’s\nBronxville address, directly contradicted any identity between the juror and the lawyer. This was\n_in fact compelling. If the sworn answers were true, the juror was not the lawyer. A contrary\nconclusion would require the lawyers to believe that a suspended lawyer would repeatedly\nperjure herself in federal court in order to sit on a jury.\nEvents in May 2oll\nl6. Juror Conrad gave the Court a note asking if the jury was going to be instructed on\nvicarious liability and respondeat superior. The contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by\nothers at the firm, to take another look at the issue the next day. The 2olo suspension order and\nan earlier suspension order from 2oo7 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A paralegal\ndiscovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted\nselected information. After seeing the selected information but before reviewing the entire\nprofile, Trzaskoma wrote “Jesus, I do think it’s her,” but then, after reviewing the entire profile,\nchanged her mind in light of the contradiction between the juror’s voir dire answers and the\nlimited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different addresses, etc.).\nIn addition, Trzaskoma did not believe that the given age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the\napparent age of juror Conrad.\nl7. Trzaskoma discussed the issue with Brune and Edelstein later in the day. All three\nconcluded that juror Conrad was not the suspended lawyer. Co-counsel with whom the mater\n_ was thereafter informally discussed thought the question not worth pursuing. Because the Brune\n& Richard lawyers did not believe — let alone have actual knouledge — that the juror and the\nsuspended lawyer were the same person, they did not present their information to the Court. At\nleast five lawyers, based on what they had seen or been told, reached this conclusion.\nl8. At this time, as earlier, no Brune & Richard lawyer had actual knouledge that juror\nConrad was lawyer Conrad. Actual knouledge is the mental state that creates the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> duty\nunder New York Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). There was no ethical duty to reveal a suspicion, even a\nstrong suspicion.\nl9.

There was no\nduty to do so. I accept that the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim\nand could see hou the government could cite the information that they had in March and May to\nbolster that claim. But the lawyer ethics rules impose no general duty to volunteer information\nthat an opponent might use to support its argument and the exceptions in the rules cited do not\ncreate one specifically.\n2l. To put it otherwise, in order to find a duty to reveal there must be a source of the duty.\nProfessional conduct rules do impose duties to reveal, but they do so in a way that gives lawyers\nnotice of their requirements. No rule required <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the information discovered in March\nor May. Any such rule would have to specify the information required to be revealed and the\nlevel of confidence in the accuracy of that information. Here, the rules imposing a duty to\ndisclose to the tribunal are Rules 3.3(b) and 3.5(d). These rules use actual knouledge as the level\nof confidence required for the duty to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. The information the lawyers had about the\nmaterial they had gathered in March and May negates actual knouledge; the actions of the\nlawyers are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knouledge. In sum, only if the\nlawyers had had actual knouledge in March or May would they have had to reveal that in July,\nand they did not have actual knouledge.\n22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that are apparently alleged to\nimply that the Brune & Richard lawyers did not have information about juror Conrad’s identity\nprior to June 2o, when they received a copy of her leter to the government.\n° Because the premises of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world\nof Rule ll is again apt: ,\n\nThe primary purpose of Rule ll is to deter baseless court filings, but this goal must be\n\nconsidered in light of the fact that, in an adversary system of litigation, the essence of the\n\nlawyer's task is to present issues of facts and law “as favorably as fairly possible” in support of\n\nthe client's claim. See United Nat. Ins. Co. v. R & D Latex Corp., 242 F.3d llo2, ll5 (9\" Cir.\n\n2ool).

Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?’”’).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5—6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” Jd. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (“I’m also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\nae\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010366.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document656 Filed o4/26/22 Pagelofl\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT sinmistaricad |\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ciesiasenisoriaes\n\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #:\nDATE FILED: 4/26/22\n\nUnited States of America,\n\n—VvV—\n\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\n\nGhislaine Maxwell,\n\nORDER\nDefendant.\nALISON J.

The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not\n\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo4o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010655.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document672 Filed o6/24/22 Page 64 of 68\nCommitee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards\nand participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors’ candor obligations in particular.\n\nIn general, as “ministers of justice,” prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations\nthan other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l.4(a) states: “In light of the 7\nprosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened\nduty of candor to the courts .. ..” Prosecutors’ candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the\nprofessional conduct rules or in courts’ sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect\ncandor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in\nenforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address\nwhat courts should expect of prosecutors as “ministers of Justice” — expectations that are not fully\ncodified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions.\n\nIf the Government were to call Ms. Giuffre as its witness in connection with the sentencing,\nthen it would have the ordinary obligation first to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony\nand then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule\n3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-l -4(b) (“The prosecutor should not make\na statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be\ntrue . . ..”) id., Standard 3-5.4(c) (“a prosecutor should make timely <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the defense of\ninformation [that tends to impeach the government’s witnesses] that is knoun to the prosecutor,\nregardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding.”).\n\nI assume that the Government does not intend to make Ms. Giuffre its witness, and that\ninsofar as Ms. Giuffre makes a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory\nright as a putative victim. Even if so, in my judgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the\nGovernment were to rely on Ms. Giuffre’s statement in its submissions to the court, thereby\nessentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit Ms. Giuffre’s information, the\nGovernment should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition\ntestimony that, it has been told, raises serious questions concerning the credibility of her relevant\ntestimony. The prosecutors should not rely on Ms. Giuffre’s information unless, in the language\nof Standard 3-l.4(b), they “reasonably believe [it] to be true.” Their belief in Ms. Giuffre’s\nreliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they\nhave been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her\naccount truthful.\n\nFinally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on Ms. Giuffre’s\nstatement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear\nsome responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have\npreviously writen: “Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing\njudge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any\nlawyer must make full and frank <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of factual maters relevant to the sentencing court’s\ndecision-making, it is surely the prosecutor.” Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446;\ncf. United States v. E.V., 5oo F.3d 747, 754 n.l2 (8 Cir. 2oo7) (referring to “prosecutors’\nobligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing”). Consequently, the Office cannot\nconsciously disregard Ms. Giuffre’s deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her\nsubmission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that Ms. Giuffre’s submission is unreliable,\n\n2\nSDNY_GM_o27759oo\nSUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, lo, l5, and l7\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo655\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010754.jpg": "Castatl2o:2ooosRIBPAKINDOnoure6S83 AlenOG2922 Reape aifh353\n[uspcspNy\nDOCUMENT\nThe New York Times ELECTRONICALLY FILED\nCompany DOC ee\nDATE FILED: 6/29/22 |\nDavid McCr. : :\nSenior Vice Heddentsle January 24, 2o22 The motion to unseal the questionnaires of the\nDeputy General Counsel twelve seated jurors is GRANTED.

We also ask that this Court\nmake clear that any subsequent briefs and exhibits filed in conjunction\nwith this motion should not be filed under seal and with only those\nredactions necessary to protect jurors’ identities.\nAs the Court knous, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of\njuror misconduct.

Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these\narguments would only enhance the Rule 4o3 prejudice.\n\nThird, apart from Rule 4ol and 4o3, the Defense’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Gershman does not\nsatisfy Rule l6. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,\nlike “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at l2. It does not mention\nGershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the\nDefense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def. Br. at\nl8. Indeed, the Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very litle of Gershman’s anticipated\ntestimony. Therefore, even if Rules 4ol and 4o3 were satisfied, the Court would exclude\nGershman’s testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule l6.\n\nIi. Conclusion\n\nThe Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert\ntestimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and\ncircumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis.

First, the Court understands that Dr. Hall could not testify to\nthe “significance” of mental health diagnoses without first testifying to what those diagnoses are.\nBecause the Court is precluding Dr. Hall’s testimony on Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court\nwill also preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony on their significance. Additionally, the current <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\non this point does not satisfy Rule l6’s requirement that the Defense provide Dr. Hall’s opinion\nrather than just the general topic of the testimony. Even if the Court admited Dr. Hall’s\ntestimony as to Alleged Victim 4’s diagnoses, the Court would preclude his testimony on\nsignificance until more specific opinions are disclosed to the Government.\n\nNext, the Defense anticipates that Dr. Hall will testify to the “bases for those opinions” in\nhis report. /d. Dr. Hall’s report refers not only to what Alleged Victim 4 told him during their\nin-person interview but also other records like ee\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll5l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 6 of lo\nmetadata). The defendant understood this to be a <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> that concerned metadata. ll/23/2l\nTr. at 2l (“Mr. Flatley was disclosed by the government for similar purposes to talk about the\nretrieval of metadata from some of the devices that were seized from Epstein’s home.”’). In any\nevent, the Government made that both explicit and highly specific in the November 26 leter, three\ndays after the defendant expressed concerns about notice. The November 26 leter identifies the\nprecise exhibits about which Flatley will testify, including the exhibits that display metadata fields\n(which were produced on October ll, 2o2l), and it provides detail about the methods and metadata\nabout which he will testify. The sufficiency of the Government’s notice is evidenced by the fact\nthat the defendant noticed a rebutal expert on November l, 2o2l, and they likewise have had\nample time to prepare any cross-examination on metadata. Thus, to the extent the Court has any\ndoubt as to whether Flatley’s testimony constitutes expert opinion, the Government would seek to\nqualify him as an expert on the relevant subjects.\n\nSecond, the remainder of Flatley’s expected testimony stated in the November 26 leter is\nclearly fact testimony. As the leter explains, Flatley will testify that he examined Government\nExhibits 54 and 55 and determined that particular other Government exhibits were stored there.\n(Ex. A at 2). And he will testify that he, personally, made images of Government Exhibits 54 and\n55. (Ex. A at l).\n\nThird, the “newly and untimely-disclosed expert opinion testimony” (Def. Leter at 5) is\nno such thing:\n\ne The primary defense concern appears to be about the statement, reflected in the 35oo\nmaterial, that Flatley examined metadata to determine the number of times the “ghislaine” user\naccount accessed Government Exhibit 54, as reflected in the notes for December 2. This is not\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-oooll85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011186.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol Filed o7/l2/22 Page 7 oflo\nexpert opinion testimony, either, and thus no notice objection can be sustained. But in any event\nthe Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,\nit is responsive to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso\nsuggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login\ndata, which shous that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”\nundermines that claim. The defendant can hardly claim that the Government provided insufficient\nnotice of testimony it discussed with the witness in response to the defendant’s expert notice and\nwhich the Government would only elicit in response to cross-examination on the subject.\n\nThere is no further opinion contained in the December 5 notes. In response to a question\nfrom defense counsel, the Government asked Flatley hou he determined the number of user\naccounts and logins, and Flatley rechecked those numbers. That information is additional detail\nfor the December 2 notes, and not itself expert opinion, new or otherwise. (And the production of\n35oo material the same day it was generated is hardly an “untimely <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.”)\n\ne Although the Government has noticed the testimony, the Government is not planning\nto elicit any expert testimony about “clones.” (Def. Leter at 4). He will simply provide fact\ntestimony that he personally created an image of the devices marked for identification as\nGovernment Exhibits 54 and 55.\n\ne Testimony that “once a file is burned onto a CD, can’t unburn it” and “on original CD,\ncreated date would be the same date as the modified date,” (Def. Leter at 5), is pure fact testimony.\nIt requires no specialized training to knou that information; Flatley can testify to those facts based\non his personal knouledge. And, again, this is testimony that the Government does not intend to\nelicit on direct examination, but rather would elicit only in response to cross-examination along\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oooll86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011195.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7ol-2 Filed o7/l2/22 Page2of3\nHaddon, Morgan and Foreman, P.c\nLaura A.

Follouing the close of the Government’s\ncase in chief, the defendant produced her witness list and Rule 26.2 disclosures. In addition, the\ndefendant atached two new documents as Rule l6 discovery: a sale agreement for the defendant’s\nLondon home at 44 Kinnerton Street (atached as Exhibit A) and a judicial opinion in United States\nv. Epstein, 96 Civ. 83o7 (DC) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 3l, l998). The Government seeks to preclude the\nsale agreement under Rule l6.!\n\nThe sale agreement should have been disclosed on November 8, 2o2l, the Court’s deadline\n' Although the judicial opinion does not appear to be admissible, the Government plans to confer\nwith the defense on that document.\n\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011207.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page 2of7\nfor defense production of Rule l6 materials. The Government is prejudiced by the defendant’s\ndecision to delay production until after the close of the Government’s case, and the defendant\nshould therefore be precluded from offering the agreement in her case-in-chief. And in any event,\nthe agreement should be excluded under Rule 4o3.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nPursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(b)(l)(A), if a defendant “requests\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under Rule l6(a)(l)(E) and the government complies,” then the defendant must permit\nthe Government to inspect any documents in the defendant’s “possession, custody, or control,”\nwhich the defendant intends to use in her “case-in-chief at trial.” Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(b)(l)(A).\nAlthough “[a] defendant would always like more information about the government’s case before\nrevealing anything about his or her oun,” Rule l6 “conditions a defendant’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations\non the government’s having made certain specified disclosures, not on the government’s laying\nopen its entire case or the defendant’s satisfaction.” United States v. Rajaratnam, o9 Cr. ll84\n(RJH), 2oll WL 72353o, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2oll); see Fed. R. Crim. P. l6 Advisory\nCommitee Note—l974 Amend. (“The majority of the Advisory Commitee is of the view that\n... the giving a broader right of discovery to the defense is dependent upon giving also a broader\nright of discovery to the prosecution.”). When the defendant “avail[s herself] of the strategy to\nobtain discovery of the government, [s]he must comply with the requirement for reciprocal\ndiscovery”—even as to exhibits the defendant might introduce only if the defendant herself\ntestifies. United States v. Ryan, 448 F. Supp. 8lo, 8lo-ll (S.D.N.Y. l978). Just as the\nGovernment has a continuing duty to disclose discoverable material after its initial Rule l6\nproduction, so the defense has the same continuing duty. See Fed. R.

R. Crim. P. l6(d)(2)(C).\nWhere a defendant makes an untimely production of Rule l6 materials, including by “not\ndisclosing the document in the first place or by not fulfilling her continuing duty to disclose,” it is\n“properly within the district court’s discretion” to exclude the evidence. United States v. Bruce,\n75 F. App’x 849, 85l (2d Cir. 2oo3); see United States v.

Factual Background\n\nThe Government has made thirty-eight discovery productions to the defense under Rule\nl6(a), beginning on August 5, 2o2o, totaling over two million pages, triggering the defendant’s\nreciprocal discovery obligations under Rule l6(b). On June 2, 2o2l, the Court ordered the\nGovernment to produce its Jencks Act material and proposed exhibit list on October ll, and the\ndefendant to provide her Rule l6 disclosures on November 8—three weeks in advance of trial.\n(Dkt.

On November 8, 2o2l, the defendant provided the Government with a Rule l6\nproduction.\n\nOn December lo, 2o2l—more than a month later, shortly after the close of the\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011209.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o3 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of7\nGovernment’s case—the defendant provided a supplemental <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of material under Rule\nl6(b)(l)(A). Document “Rule l6 oo7” appears to be a sale agreement for the defendant’s home\nat 44 Kinnerton Street, London, dated December l9, l996. Lf rr\nes ee\n|\n\nAlthough the defense has not specified the relevance of this document, it appears to be\noffered in service of the argument that the defendant did not live at this address in l994, which is\nwhen Kate testified she first visited the defendant there. To be clear, the document does not\nactually establish that fact: The defendant herself has testified under oath that she lived in the 44\nKinnerton Street residence beginning in l992 or l993 (see Exhibit B), and even assuming the date\nof sale is accurate, it hardly precludes the possibility that the defendant lived there at an earlier\ndate.\n\nIll. Discussion\n\nThe defendant’s decision to withhold the sale agreement until the close of the\nGovernment’s case violates her Rule l6 obligations. The records were within her possession,\ncustody, and control long before trial, and the theory for which the Government expects the\ndefendant to use the agreement has been apparent since the Government’s production of Jencks\nAct material in mid-October, before the defendant’s initial Rule l6 deadline. By failing to disclose\nthe agreement until the close of the Government’s case, the defendant has prevented the\nGovernment from conducting a full investigation, causing prejudice to the Government. The Court\n2 Nor does it preclude the possibility that Kate was simply mistaken about which of the defendant’s\nLondon residences she first visited.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oooll2o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011236.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7o4 Filed o7/l2/22 Page4of8\nthat “[t]here is no allegation that I is a victim of any improper or illegal conduct by Mr.\nEpstein or Ms. Maxwell” and offers no suggestion that [i would face any particularized harm\nshould she testify under her true name.

There is accordingly no legal basis for i to testify under a\npseudonym.\n\nFor Michelle Healy, the defendant claims that she is the same Michelle who, on cross-\nexamination, Jane recalled participating in sexualized massages with her and Epstein after Jane\nreached the age of consent and moved to New York.” On this theory, which the Government\ndisputes, the defendant claims Healy is a victim-witness entitled to the same solicitude as the\nvictims who testified in the Government’s case-in-chief. (Def. Leter at 7-8). The defendant’s\nposition is misplaced. First, the defendant has not established that Healy is the same Michelle that\nJane referenced in her testimony. Indeed, the Government anticipates filing a separate motion to\npreclude Healy’s testimony in part because there is an insufficient basis to find that Healy’s\ntestimony would in fact contradict Jane’s.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, it appears based on the defendant’s Rule 26.2 disclosures that Healy\nwill testify that she was not a victim of Epstein and the defendant.

The\ndefendant has not produced any Rule 26.2 disclosures regarding lL so the Government has\nvery limited information regarding her identity and no information about her expected testimony.\nBut it does not appear from the defendant’s leter that her testimony will concern anything\nsensitive.

The government insisted Examiner Flatley\nwould not offer expert opinions. Instead, the government claimed Examiner Flatley would offer\nfact testimony about the steps he took to extract and clone certain devices seized under a search\nwarrant. This was the full description of the expected testimony:\n\nThe Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner Flatley will\n\ntestify about his extraction of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll3ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011313.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 7l5 Filed o7/l2/22 Page3of8\nThe Honorable Alison J.

Examiner Flatley will\nexplain that he confirmed the accuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data\n\nAD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner Flatley will explain that metadata is\n\ninformation about a file, such as the file name and when the file was created.

The government contends\nthat it was prejudiced by its oun failure to investigate whether its witness was telling the truth.”\nGov. Leter at 6. Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories\nabout where Ms. Maxwell lived in l994—at a home in the Kensington neighborhood, or at the\nKinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood. The government chose not to investigate\nwhere Ms. Maxwell actually lived in l994 and which, if any, of Kate’s stories were true. That is\nnot Ms. Maxwell’s fault. And neither is it her duty to do the government’s work for it. The\ngovernment cannot seriously contend that an investigation into where Ms. Maxwell lived “did\nnot become necessary” until after Kate testified. Gov. Leter at 6.\n\nThe government complains about the difficulty of conducting investigations abroad. Gov.\nLeter at 6 (“That is a time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving\nmultiple agencies in each country that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the\nconclusion of trial.”). The government’s complaints are overwrought. For one thing, the\ngovernment had investigators in the United Kingdom investigating Ms. Maxwell’s college\nrecord. There was nothing preventing these investigators from asking the most basic of\nquestions: When did Ms. Maxwell purchase the Kinnerton Street property?\n\n?

And it would pervert the search for the truth, mislead the jury, and\nundermine the integrity of the criminal justice system.

And Jane does not authorize\nMr. Glassman to testify about any of his alleged communications with her.\n\nFurther, as a California atorney, Mr. Glassman is bound by California Rule of\nProfessional Conduct l.6.

A California atorney may only disclose confidential information if: (l) the client\ngives informed consent, or (2) the atorney believes <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is necessary to prevent the client\nfrom commiting a crime that will cause death or grave bodily harm. Here, to the extent the\n“ther” in Ms. Moe’s email refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent. And Mr.\nGlassman obviously has no reason to believe that disclosing any alleged communication he gave\nminimum, distasteful and designed to intimidate the witness, and should be discouraged. But\nprocedurally, the appearance date on the subpoena is November 29, 2o2l - two days before he\nwas served - making it impossible for him to comply.

The lawyer-client privilege and\nwork-product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be\ncalled as a witness or be otherwise compelled to produce evidence concerning a client.\nA lawyer’s ethical duty of confidentiality is not so limited in its scope of protection for the\nlawyer-client relationship of trust and prevents a lawyer from revealing the client’s\ninformation even when not subjected to such compulsion.

Although a lawyer is not permited to reveal\ninformation protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) concerning a client’s past,\ncompleted criminal acts, the policy favoring the preservation of human life that underlies\nthis exception to the duty of confidentiality and the evidentiary privilege permits\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to prevent a future or ongoing criminal act.\nLawyer not subject to discipline for revealing information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited under this rule\n[4] Paragraph (b) reflects a balancing between the interests of preserving client\nconfidentiality and of preventing a criminal act that a lawyer reasonably believes”* is\n\n2\n\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011417.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Pagellof l4\nlikely to result in death or substantial* bodily harm to an individual.

A lawyer may decide not to reveal such information. Whether a lawyer\nchooses to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited\nunder this rule is a mater for the individual lawyer to decide, based on all the facts and\ncircumstances, such as those discussed in Comment [6] of this rule.\n\nWhether to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code section\n6o68, subdivision (e) as permited under paragraph (b)\n\n[6] <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> permited under paragraph (b) is ordinarily a last resort, when no\nother available action is reasonably” likely to prevent the criminal act.

If necessary, the client may be persuaded to do\nboth. The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e) and in taking\nresponsible action to deal with situations atributable to the client. If a client, whether in\nresponse to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by\nceasing the client’s oun criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from commiting or\ncontinuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nby the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer\nbe present.

Before counseling an actor\nwho is a nonclient, the lawyer should, if reasonable* under the circumstances, first\nadvise the client of the lawyer’s intended course of action. If a client or another person*\nhas already acted but the intended harm has not yet occurred, the lawyer should\nconsider, if reasonable* under the circumstances, efforts to persuade the client or third\nperson* to warn the victim or consider other appropriate action to prevent the harm.\nEven when the lawyer has concluded that paragraph (b) does not permit the lawyer to\nreveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l), the lawyer nevertheless\nis permited to counsel the client as to why it may be in the client’s best interest to\nconsent to the atorney’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of that information.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of information protected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68,\nSubdivision (e)(l) must be no more than is reasonably* necessary to prevent the\ncriminal act\n[8] Paragraph (d) requires that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information protected by Business and\nProfessions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited by paragraph (b), when\nmade, must be no more extensive than is necessary to prevent the criminal act.\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> should allou access to the information to only those persons* who the lawyer\nreasonably believes* can act to prevent the harm.

(See rule l.4; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6o68,\nsubd. (m).) Paragraph (c)(2), houever, recognizes that under certain circumstances,\ninforming a client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) would likely increase the\nrisk of death or substantial* bodily harm, not only to the originally-intended victims of the\ncriminal act, but also to the client or members of the client’s family, or to the lawyer or\nthe lawyer's family or associates. Therefore, paragraph (c)(2) requires a lawyer to\ninform the client of the lawyer’s ability or decision to reveal information protected by\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as permited in paragraph (b) only if it is reasonable™* to\ndo so under the circumstances. Paragraph (c)(2) further recognizes that the\nappropriate time for the lawyer to inform the client may vary depending upon the\ncircumstances. (See Comment [lo] of this rule.) Among the factors to be considered in\ndetermining an appropriate time, if any, to inform a client are:\n\n(l) whether the client is an experienced user of legal services;\n\n(2) the frequency of the lawyer's contact with the client;\n\n(3) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n(4) whether the lawyer and client have discussed the lawyer’s duty of\nconfidentiality or any exceptions to that duty;\n\n(5) the likelihood that the client's mater will involve information within\nparagraph (b);\n\n(6) — the lawyer’s belief,* if applicable, that so informing the client is likely to\nincrease the likelihood that a criminal act likely to result in the death of, or\nsubstantial* bodily harm to, an individual; and\n\n(7) — the lawyer’s belief,“ if applicable, that good faith efforts to persuade a\nclient not to act on a threat have failed.\n\nAvoiding a chilling effect on the lawyer-client relationship\n[lo] The foregoing flexible approach to the lawyer’s informing a client of his or her\nability or decision to reveal information protected by Business and Professions Code\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooll4l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011420.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 73l-l Filed o7/l4/22 Page l4 of l4\nsection 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) recognizes the concern that informing a client about\nlimits on confidentiality may have a chilling effect on client communication. (See\nComment [l].) To avoid that chilling effect, one lawyer may choose to inform the client\nof the lawyer’s ability to reveal information protected by section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l)\nas early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform\na client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within\nparagraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer\natempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the\nlawyer will have satisfied the lawyer’s obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be\nsubject to discipline.\n\nInforming client that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> has been made; termination of the lawyer-client\nrelationship\n[ll] When a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions\nCode section 6o68, subdivision (e) as permited in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary\ncases the relationship between lawyer and client that is based on trust and confidence\nwill have deteriorated so as to make the lawyer’s representation of the client impossible.\nTherefore, when the relationship has deteriorated because of the lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\nthe lawyer is required to seek to withdraw from the representation, unless the client has\ngiven informed consent* to the lawyer’s continued representation. The lawyer normally\nmust inform the client of the fact of the lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. If the lawyer has a\ncompelling interest in not informing the client, such as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s\nfamily or a third person* from the risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer\nmust withdraw from the representation. (See rule l.l6.)\nOther consequences of the lawyer's <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\n[l2] Depending upon the circumstances of a lawyer’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information\nprotected by Business and Professions Code section 6o68, subdivision (e)(l) as\npermited by this rule, there may be other important issues that a lawyer must address.\nFor example, a lawyer who is likely to testify as a witness in a mater involving a client\nmust comply with rule 3.7. Similarly, the lawyer must also consider his or her duties of\nloyalty and competence.

Confidentiality is particularly important in the EVCP given that it involves claims\nof sexual abuse and given the history of the Epstein case. In my experience, it can be incredibly\ndifficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such deeply personal, intimate, private information\nabout their experiences and the impact it has had on their lives. To compound that, victims of\nsexual abuse often suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in positions of\nauthority as well as a fear of exposure. This is especially true of victims of Jeffrey Epstein,\nmany of whom share a common distrust of the justice system and lack of faith in basic principles\nof fairness.\n\n7. Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that many victims were initially\nreluctant to participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express\nassurance of confidentiality. I had countless conversations with victims’ counsel and sexual\nabuse experts when the Program was being designed in which they vigorously expressed this\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-oooll468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011471.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-l Filed o7/l5/22 Page5of7\nextensive measures to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all information submited to,\nmaintained by, exchanged with and distributed by the Program.\n\nl2. With the express assurance of confidentiality, and without the formality of court\nproceedings or fear of exposure and cross examination, victims agreed to participate in the\nProgram, let their guards doun and share exceedingly intimate, private information. Claimants\nrelied upon the express condition and assurances of confidentiality in agreeing to support the\nvery existence of the Program, in deciding to participate in the claims process, and in submiting\ntheir claims and any other information to the EVCP. They were willing to trust this process,\ndespite deep-seated distrust of purported systems of “justice,” because of Program\nconfidentiality.\n\nl3. Compromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very foundation\nand fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims who are already\nloath to disclose such personal information. The idea that the information the victims agreed to\ndisclose to the EVCP solely for purposes of evaluation and potential resolution of the claim\nwould be disclosed to anyone outside the EVCP for any other purpose is anathema to the\nintegrity of this Program and others like it.

I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the\nclaims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the\nintegrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.\n\nl6.

Program Integrity\n\nFor the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible\nClaimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent\nclaims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies,\nirregularities or duplication.\nEach Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information\nprovided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant’s knouledge, and that the\nClaimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may\nresult in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be\npotentially fraudulent or to contain information knoun by the Claimant to be false when made will be\nforwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the\nDistrict Atorney and/or United States Atorney’s Office for possible investigation and prosecution.\n\nD. Confidentiality/Privacy\nThe Program is confidential. By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal\nRepresentative (where applicable) agrees that information submited by the Claimant pursuant to\nthe Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the\nfollouing purposes:\n\nl) Processing and evaluating the Claimant’s claim;\n2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and\n3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims.\nWhen documents or other information maintained or submited by the Estate become part of a\nClaimant’s file for purposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to\nassist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. No information\nprovided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant’s name and the date(s)\nand location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and,\nfor purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant\nalleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained\nsolely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any\nclaim, regardless of forum. The Program’s files are not available for inspection, review or copying by\nthe Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent\nl All parties agree that they are using the services of a third-party administrator to help reach a resolution of individual claims\nof sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, setlement and all other pertinent\nprivileges), and protection from <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under applicable law.\n8|Page\nDOJ-OGR-oooll485\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00011515.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 734-8 Filed o7/l5/22 Page loofl3\n| Probate ST-l9-PB-oo8o l7l\nl} program, quote, contains no assurances that\n2) the information submited by a claimant cannot |\n3| be later used against her if she thereafter\n4| decides to file suit against the estate or any |\n5| other co-defendant.\n6 Is that criticism grounded in\n7| the way you see the program? |\n8) A.

So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations.

So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2324\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012334.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 49 of 228 725\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl (At sidebar)\n\n2 MR.

So in the case of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in terms of child\n2l sexual abuse, we would call <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q.

Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2344\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012345.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 228 736\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there\n23 have been identified both internal barriers and external\n24 barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n25 Q. When you say \"external barriers,\" what are you referring\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012346.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

If we are\n\nl5 talking about adults, a trusted friend.

Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical practice, hou do people who\n2l have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose\n22 the abuse?\n23 A. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is a process that unfolds over time. So\n24 individuals will typically begin the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> maybe by\n25 alluding to what's happened in a general sense or the gist of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool2349\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012350.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 65 of 228 74l\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl what's happened. And then it's only over time that they will\n\n2 begin to talk more specifically about what has happened. And\n\n3 even in therapy, oftentimes <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the most intimate or\n4 difficult details is something that's very hard and individuals\n5 are very reluctant to do.\n\n6 Q. Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical experience, what factors --\n\n7 withdrawn, your Honor.\n\n8 Dr. Rocchio, in your clinical and forensic experience,\n9 what factors contribute to if and when a person discloses the\nlo childhood sexual abuse they experienced?\n\nll A. It has to do with the degree to which they feel safe, the\nl2 degree to which they feel that they are going to be believed.\nl3 Again, as it's a process that unfolds over time, they may begin\nl4 to talk about it. And then to the extent that they are geting\nl5 messages that they are being judged or that they are being\n\nl6 blamed or shamed, they may shut doun. To the extent that they\nl7 feel supported and believed, then they may be more likely to\n\nl8 continue with that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, again, over time.\n\nl9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what, if any, long-term impact does childhood\n2o sexual abuse have on victims?\n2l A. We knou that although all adverse events that occur during\n22 childhood can place children at higher risk for adverse\n23 outcomes, we knou that among those, child sexual abuse in\n24 particular increases risk for a very, very high number of\n25 various health problems and mental health problems and also\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool235o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012357.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 72 of 228 748\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl for the Court because we think that such questions would be\n\n2 inappropriate on cross—-examination.\n\n3 THE COURT: So beyond the scope.\n\n4 MS.

Those\n2l are the kinds of things that would impact memory and,\n22 therefore, delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, which I think are fair game on\n23 cross-examination; psychological conditions that may impact\n24 delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is fair game on cross-examination.\n25 So those are some of the topics.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool2357\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES005/DOJ-OGR-00012358.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 73 of 228 749\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl THE COURT: So the basic point is to the extent she\n\n2 talked about the literature regarding delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in the\n3 context of sexual abuse, you want to ask if there are other\n\n4 reasons for delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\n5 MR.

That was who I was referring to\n\n8 there because the other person who we had put the name on the\n\n9 witness list who is from the U.K., we had decided not to call\nlo that person before yesterday.

So to the\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4955\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014956.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 8oofl58 8o\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl extent that someone doesn't recognize that what's happening to\n2 them or doesn't cognitively label it as abuse, obviously that's\n3 not something that can be reported.\n\n4 But then of course the relationship itself also\n\n5 functions to make <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> less likely, because either the\n\n6 individual has been made, in the course of the relationship, to\n7 feel somewhat responsible, they might feel shame, or they may\n\n8 blame themselves; or to the extent that they've come to care\n\n9 for the person who's harming them, they may be afraid of\n\nlo geting that individual in trouble; or to the extent that the\nll relationship as a whole clearly has positive elements to it\n\nl2 apart from and distinct from the abusive elements, they may --\nl3 it's fulfilling some need on the part of the victim, they may\nl4 be fearful of losing those pieces.\n\nl5 Q.

What is delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>?\n\nl9 A. \"Delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\" is a term that's used in the\n2o literature to refer to telling about an experience of, well, in\n2l this case, sexual assault at some point after the event has\n22 occurred.\n23 Q. Does <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. So there have been a number of studies that have looked at\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014957.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 8loofl58 8l\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl what are some of the predictors of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and to --\n2 the studies that have been done that have looked at different\n\n3 age groups have found that those ages l2 to l8, that is,\n\n4 adolescents, are much more likely to have a delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\n5 as opposed to adults. So rates of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> kind of match up\n6 closer to the time of event as somebody ages.\n\n7 Q. And in terms of adolescents, can you explain hou common\n\n8 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is and why.\n\n9 A. So the rates of delays <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> have been studied a lot\nlo in various populations. And so we knou most of the studies\n\nll shou that the majority of victims of childhood sexual abuse who\nl2 are abused during adolescence don't disclose until sometime\n\nl3 later, typically in adulthood. And there are other factors\n\nl4 that are associated with delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in adolescents, but\nl5 in terms of age that would be one.\n\nl6 Q. Can you explain why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of childhood sexual abuse is\nl7 not common among adolescents?\n\nl8 A. Part of it has to do with the developmental life stage of\nl9 an adolescent individually. I mean, they -- we knou that even\n2o if an adolescent does tell, for example, anyone, they're\n2l likely, most likely to tell a peer. Adolescents tend not to\n22 like to talk to adults.\n23 Also, adolescents often like to think of themselves as\n24 older and more competent. To the extent that they are involved\n25 in a sexually abusive relationship with an older person, they\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4957\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014958.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 82oofl58 82\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may\n\n2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been\n\n3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehou a love, a\n\n4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it\n5 as abuse.\n\n6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,\n\n7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal\n8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,\n\n9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of\n\nlo being judged.\n\nll And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.\nl2 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you knou,\nl3 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults\n\nl4 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in\n\nl5 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.\n\nl6 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, hou do\n\nl7 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about\nl8 or disclose the abuse?\n\nl9 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of\n2o the literature looking at hou and why do people disclose or not\n2l disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that\n22 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> most often takes place to appear not -- for an\n23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to\n24 formal agencies.\n25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4958\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014959.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 83oofl58 83\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl Q. Yes. The question was, when -- based on your experience,\n\n2 research, and training, hou do people who have experienced\n\na childhood sexual abuse talk about or disclose the abuse?\n\n4 A. Basically that is something that occurs in the context of a\n\n5 relationship, and the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> comes out kind of over time in\n\n6 the context of that relationship.\n\n7 Q. What doctors contribute to hou much a person discloses\n\n8 about the sexual abuse they experienced?\n\n9 A. That will depend on the level of safety that they feel in\nlo the relationship. That will also depend on the response that\nll they're geting from the person that they're making --\n\nl2 beginning to make the initial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to. So, for example,\nl3 research that's been done on barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, as well as\nl4 research that's been done to train and teach people on hou to\nl5 respond when receiving the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, has found, you knou,\nl6 things that imply any sort of blame, shame, minimization, or\nl7 negative response will certainly shut doun the process of\nl8 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> quite -- and think, you knou, to the extent that\nl9 you're responding empathically to the extent that you're\n2o listening and atending to these, to the extent that that\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is happening in the context of a relationship of\n22 trust and safety, then the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is more likely to evolve\nao over time.\n24 Q. Hou if at all does memory play a role in <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>?\n25 A.

Sure. If we're talking about child sexual abuse, someone\n\n2 may have atended to the -- and knoun full well that they were\n3 being sexually abused and they may have very clear memory of\n\n4 certain sounds, certain smells, breath, certain physical\n\n5 sensations. Alternatively, someone who is dissociating and\n\n6 trying very hard not -- to not think and not atend to what's\n\n7 happening to them, they may have very vivid details of the\n\n8 swirls on the ceiling or the patern on the wallpaper.\n\n9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, hou do the topics of memory that you just\n\nlo testified about fit into your expertise?\n\nll A. So as a psychologist, again, these general principles of\n\nl2 memory are part of what I've been trained in throughout my\n\nl3 career and, as a trauma psychologist in particular, certainly\nl4 hou individuals talk about their experiences, hou they remember\nl5 what's happened to them and what is typical, in terms of\n\nl6 memory. Again, what are the general principles about memory is\nl7 absolutely part of the literature and the research within the\nl8 field of trauma psychology, as well as psychology generally,\n\nl9 more broadly.\n2o Q. In your education, did you learn about delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>?\n2l A. We taught -- we learned certainly about hou people tell\n22 their stories. And certainly when I was trained in assessment\n23 technigues, for example, in my training, and I was taught about\n24 hou to ask about abuse experiences, I was also told, you knou,\n25 be mindful that if someone answers your questions, this may be\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool496l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014962.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 86oofl58 86\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl the first time they've ever talked about it.\n\n2 Similarly, through trainings and readings and in my\n\n3 graduate program, also being taught that when you make an\n\n4 assessment it's really important, when someone is talking about\n5 their experiences, to inquire of them what their experiences\n\n6 were like with <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, because that can be so impactful.\n\n7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated\n\n8 patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they experienced as\n9 children but disclosed such abuse later?\n\nlo A. Yes.\n\nll Q. Can you explain.\n\nl2 A. I've, as I mentioned, when I do an assessment and I'm\n\nl3 talking with people about experiences of child sexual abuse,\n\nl4 one of the common and important guestions I will ask is: and at\nl5 the time that this was happening or at some point later, did\n\nl6 you share your experiences with anyone; did you tell anyone.\n\nl7 And as I said, in terms of a -- in a clinical seting, that\n\nl8 information is very important. We knou that the responses of\nl9 the person that they told have significant impact on the\n2o adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.\n2l Also, of course we knou that if people don't tell,\n22 then that also means they likely didn't get medical care or\nao assistance at the time of the event. And that also is highly\n24 relevant.\n25 So I see that a lot in my clinical practice.

The majority of the patients that I work\n7 with who've -- who've experienced childhood sexual abuse, like\n8 all victims of child sexual abuse, the abuses, a majority that\n9 has occur, most likely will occur in the context of a\nlo relationship.

When patients have disclosed that they experienced\n2o childhood sexual abuse to you for the first time, were your\n2l patients adults or children?\n22 A. I would say that when they're making an initial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\n23 for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was\n24 working in an inpatient seting at times I, I certainly worked\n25 with adolescents who had made <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> while they were still\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool4963\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00014964.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 782 Filed ol/l5/25 Page 88ofl58 88\nLBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Direct\n\nl kids around the time, so not as much delayed.\n\n2 Q. Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated\n3 and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual\n4 abuse at the time of the abuse?\n\n5 A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one\n6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said\n7 that they told right away.

You just mentioned very young children. What are you\n\nl8 referring to?\n\nl9 A. We knou that delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> happens over time.

Hou?\n\n2 A. Through the clinical literature, through the training.\n\na Again, if either I'm conducting training and I'm teaching\n\n4 others or I'm participating in the training that's talking\n\n5 about what are some of the common themes and issues and things\n6 that you need to deal with in a psychotherapy and clinical and\n7 assessment context, we'll often talk about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and in\n\n8 particular things like, we also knou that so many individuals\n\n9 of child sexual abuse but also of rape and sexual assault of\n\nlo all kinds don't necessarily label their experiences as such.\n\nll So when I'm teaching, or ways that I've been taught and trained\nl2 is to use behavioral descriptors of what I'm asking about. So,\nl3 for example, there have been numerous studies that say, you\n\nl4 knou, lf you ask a group of individuals, say college students,\nl5 have you ever had an experience where someone physically forced\nl6 you to engage in sexual activity against your will, they'll,\n\nl7 you knou, a certain percentage of them will say yes. And then\nl8 if you follou you and say, have you ever been raped, no. So\n\nl9 you have to use behavioral descriptors, because people for a\n2o variety of reasons don't necessarily label their experiences as\n2l abuse. And that's also true with varying kinds of violence as\n22 well. Have you been abused, versus, have these behaviors\n23 happened to you.\n24 Q.

I spoke earlier about prevalence\n\nl6 rates where you're asking people, often in anonymous surveys\n\nl7 but sometimes in interview setings, but in research studies,\nl8 about a variety of experiences.

Preliminary Statement\n\nThe Government respectfully submits this memorandum in response to the Court’s Orders\nconceming the two pending motions to unseal grand jury transcripts (Epstein Dkt. 6l; Maxwell\nDkt. 785) in cases prosecuted in this District. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3).\nThis memorandum, as directed by the Court, addresses the specific facts and factors highlighted\nin the Court’s Orders relevant to the particular grand jury materials at issue here. (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat l-3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-3). In order to ensure that “[t]ransparency in this process ... not be\nat the expense of [the Government’s] obligation under the law to protect victims” (Epstein Dkt. 6l\nat 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2), the Government also respectfully requests leave to file a supplemental\nsubmission once the Government and the Court have received any filings from the victims or\nothers referenced in the transcripts.\nIl. The Court’s Orders\n\nAs the Court recognized (Epstein Dkt. 63 at l-2; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at l-2), the Second\nCircuit has held that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in which release of grand jury\nrecords is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2 (2d\nCir. l997); see also In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 494 (2d Cir. l973) (supplemental opinion)\n(Friendly, C.J.) (recognizing that there are certain “special circumstances” in which release of\ngrand jury records is appropriate even outside of the boundaries of Rule 6(e)).! The Second Circuit\nenumerated a list of non-exhaustive factors for trial courts to consider when deciding such motions:\n' There is currently a Circuit split. See Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l233 & n.6 (llth Cir.\n2o2o) (en banc) (describing the Circuit split); Jn re Petition for Order Directing Release of\nRecords, 27 F.4th 84, 9o-9l (lst Cir. 2o22) (same). In light of this split, when the Government\nsought similar relief seeking to unseal grand jury transcripts in the Southern District of Florida\nfrom 2oo5 and 2oo7 relating to Epstein, the Honorable Robin L. Rosenberg—who is bound by the\nEleventh Circuit’s rule barring extra-Rule disclosures set forth in Piteh—denied that motion. /n re\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o63\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015064.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page3oflo\n(i) the identity of the party seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (ll) whether the\ndefendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; (i) why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is being sought in the particular\ncase; (iv) what specific information is being sought for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>;\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place; (vi) the\ncurrent status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that\nof their families; (vi) the extent to which the desired material—\neither permissibly or impermissibly—has been previously made\npublic; (vi) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who\nmight be affected by <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are still alive; and (ix) the additional\nneed for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nIn re Craig, l33 F.3d at lo6.\n\nOn July 22, 2o25, the Court directed the Government to file a memorandum of law\n“addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as germane to\nits application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). The Court also directed the\nGovernment to state whether, “before filing the instant motion, counsel for the Government\nreviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government provided notice to the\nvictims of the motion to unseal,” and to submit: (l) indices of Epstein and Maxwell grand jury\nmaterials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a complete set of the\nEpstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of the Epstein\nand Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand\njury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits.

The In re Craig Factors\n\nThe Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors\nand any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63\nat 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follous is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which\nare designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in\npublic <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest\nand the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. /n re Craig,\nl3l F.3d at lo4.\n\nl. The Identity of the Party Seeking <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe first factor considers which party is seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury materials; the\nidentity of the party seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here,\nthe Government is seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with\nincreasing calls for additional disclosures in this mater.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as\na preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not\ndispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, nor can\ngovernment opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknouledges the extraordinary\n? See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at\nFederal Prison - United States House Commitee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense\npublic interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the ll9th Congress, on February ll, 2o25, the\nCommitee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a leter to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession\nregarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force\nsent another leter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein\nfiles’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o65\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015066.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page5oflo\nnature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the\nunderlying proceedings.\n\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the\nGovernment Opposes the <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof grand jury materials. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll\nInquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2o22) (affirming denial of motion to disclose\ngrand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 8oo F.2d l293,\nl3o5 (4th Cir. l986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and\nexhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).\n\nDefendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell\nhas indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell\nDkt. 793).\n\n3. Why <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThe third factor considers “why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that\nin some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury\ninformation.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly\nexpressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond\nthat, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of\nJustice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.\n3 As noted belou, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family\nconcerning the instant motion.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015067.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page6oflo\nSupp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. l999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent\ncountless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the\npublic’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). Atention given to the\nEpstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum\nannouncing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.\n\nThe instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in\nthat memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information\nto the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\n\n4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThe fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo6. Here, the Government seeks the public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury\ntranscripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 6l at l; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at l). As\nstated in the pending motions, any public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> granted by the Court would be “subject to\nappropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein\nDkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n5. Hou Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place\n\nThe fifth factor asks hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6. The grand jury met in June and July of 2ol9 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met\nin June and July of 2o2o and March of 2o2l in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has\nnot dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7 (“if historical interest\nin a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that\nthe public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).\n\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o67\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015068.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page 7 oflo\n6. The Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury Proceedings\nand that of their Families\n\nThe sixth factor considers “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings\nand that of their families.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99. The passage of time “brings about the death\nof the principal parties involved in the investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.”\nId. at lo6. The Court should consider the “continued existence and vulnerabilities of such parties.”\nId.\n\nIn this case, the grand jury testimony was offered specifically in connection with charges\nproposed against Epstein and Maxwell. Epstein is deceased, and no family member has approached\nthe Government indicating an interest in the instant motions. One of Epstein’s family members\npreviously filed a request for materials pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment responded to that request, and no litigation ensued. Maxwell currently is\nincarcerated, and no family member has approached the Government indicating an interest in the\nmotions.\n\n7. The Extent to Which the Desired Material—Either Permissibly or\nImpermissibly—Has Been Previously Made Public\n\nThe Government is not aware of the relevant grand jury transcripts being impermissibly\nleaked to the public.\n\nCertain aspects and subject maters of the transcripts became public during Maxwell’s trial.\nTo the extent that any of the desired material was disclosed to Maxwell as a result of the\nGovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, it was disclosed pursuant to a protective order.\n\nMany of the victims whose accounts relating to Epstein and Maxwell that were the subject\nof grand jury testimony testified at trial consistent with the accounts described by an FBI agent\nand the detective from the New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) in the grand jury and\nsome have also made public those factual accounts in the course of civil litigation. The\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR- oool5o68\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015069.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 796 Filed o7/29/25 Page8oflo\nGovernment is providing under seal a list of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand\njury proceedings and a corresponding list noting which witnesses testified at trial.\n\n8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might Be\nAffected by <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Are Still Alive\n\nThe eighth factor considers “whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might\nbe affected by <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are still alive.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nHere, there was one witness—an FBI agent—during the Epstein grand jury proceedings.\nThere were two witnesses—the same FBI agent from the Epstein grand jury proceedings and a\ndetective with the NYPD who was a Task Force Officer with the FBI’s Child Exploitation and\nHuman Trafficking Task Force—during the Maxwell grand jury proceedings.\n\nBoth witnesses are still alive; the FBI agent continues to be an agent with the FBI, and the\nDetective continues to be a Detective with the NYPD as well as a Task Force Officer.\n\nConsistent with applicable rules concerning the admissibility of hearsay testimony, the\ngrand jury witnesses described statements of others, including statements of and concerning\nvictims, many of whom are still alive. In the sealed submission accompanying this filing, the\nGovernment will note which victims are still alive.\n\n9. Whether There Is an Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the\nParticular Case in Question\n\nFinally, the ninth factor considers “the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the\nparticular case in question.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. In addition to the typical reasons for\ngrand jury secrecy, the grand jury transcripts contain victim-related and other personal identifying\ninformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the\ncrimes with which Epstein and Maxwell were charged, to which the Government is sensitive, and\nwhich is why the Government proposes redacting the transcripts before releasing them. (See\nEpstein Dkt. 6l at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o69\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015080.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page2of4\nHon.

Analyzing hou the Nolle Prosequi ([Epstein] ECF No. 52)\nfiled in this case impacts proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, with legal\nauthorities.\n\n(Epstein Dkt. 67). In the Maxwell case, the Court directed the Government to provide additional\ninformation by August 4, 2o25, in particular, a leter:\n\nl. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand\njury exhibits as well as the transcripts, or just the transcripts.\n\n2. Identifying with specificity the grand jury exhibits, as\nredacted for public release, that are not already part of the\npublic record. In making this assessment, the Government\nshould take into account whether the unredacted portions of\nthese exhibits were received in evidence during trial in this\ncase, otherwise disclosed on the docket of this case, or\ndisclosed in the course of civil litigation, see, e.g., Giuffre v.\nMaxwell, l5 Civ. 7433 (LAP).\n\n3. Identifying with specificity the information testified to in the\ngrand jury transcripts, as redacted for proposed release, that\nis not already part of the public record, taking into account\nthe sources above.\n\n(Maxwell Dkt. 797).\n\nBecause the Court’s Orders, and the information sought, are consistent in several respects,\nthe Government respectfully submits this consolidated leter response.\n\nFirst, at this time, the Government has moved only to unseal the grand jury transcripts in\nthese cases. Of course, the grand jury exhibits are not the only exhibits in these cases; a large\nnumber of exhibits were admited at the Maxwell trial, which trial exhibits are—subject to\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—presumptively public documents. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo49 (2d Cir. l995) (“the public has an especially strong right of\naccess to evidence introduced in trials” (internal quotation marks and citation omited)); United\nStates v. Akhavan, 532 F. Supp. 3d l8l, l86 (S.D.N.Y. 2o2l) (“trial exhibits are judicial\ndocuments to which an ‘especially strong’ common law presumption of access applies” (quoting\nAmodeo, 7l F.3d at lo49)). The Government previously made those trial exhibits—subject to any\njudicially approved redactions and/or sealing—available to the public through a website during\nthe Maxwell trial.\n\nThe Government respectfully requests leave of the Court to advise the Court by August 8,\n2o25, of its position with respect to unsealing of the grand jury exhibits. Such timing will permit\nthe Government to consider (with respect to its underlying position as well as with respect to any\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015081.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo Filed o8/o5/25 Page3of4\nHon.

The Maxwell grand\njury met on June 29, 2o2o, July 8, 2o2o, and March 29, 2o2l.\n\nThird, the Government has provided the Court with all substantive exhibits from the grand\njury presentations in each of the Epstein and Maxwell cases that it currently has in its possession.\nThe Government respectfully submits under seal to Judge Berman one additional grand jury\nexhibit from the Epstein case that it referenced in its leter to the Court but did not have readily\navailable at that time.\n\nFourth, in connection with this leter, the Government respectfully submits to Judge\nEngelmayer under seal and ex parte a version of the Maxwell grand jury transcripts that\nspecifically identifies which information in the transcripts is not, as far as the Government is aware,\npublicly available. As previewed in the Government’s submission of July 29, 2o25, many of the\nvictims and witnesses testified at trial consistent with the accounts offered in the grand jury by\ninvestigating law enforcement witnesses. The enclosed, annotated transcripts shou that much of\nthe information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony—with the exception of the\nidentities of certain victims and witnesses—was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise\nbeen publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses. !\n\nFifth, the substantive grand jury exhibits are not currently part of the public record. The\nGovernment, houever, is undertaking to identify for the Court any specific portions of the grand\njury exhibits that are reflected in the public record. In doing so, the Government endeavors to\ncompare the exhibits against the voluminous public and sealed exhibits offered at the Maxwell\ntrial and to review certain relevant civil litigation dockets of which the Government is aware to the\nextent such dockets are publicly available. The Government respectfully requests leave of the\nCourt to supplement this leter no later than August 8, 2o25, in order to respond to item 4 of Judge\nBerman’s Order and item 2 of Judge Engelmayer’s Order.\n\nSixth, the nolle prosequi filed in the Epstein case does not impact the proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nWhile the Supreme Court has noted—in a different context—that a Court’s “jurisdiction end[s]”\nwhen “a nolle prosequi [is] entered,” Ex parte Wilson, l4o U.S. 575, 583 (l89l), it did so in the\ncontext of a court having the ability to enter a judgment. To the contrary, at least one court has\nexplicitly held that a nolle prosequi does not deprive a court of the authority to determine whether\nto disclose sealed grand jury minutes. United States v. Byoir, 58 F. Supp. 273, 274 (N.D. Tex.),\n' Although there was no public trial of Epstein, the Government is prepared to do a similar\nanalysis regarding the Epstein grand jury transcripts if Judge Berman believes it would assist in\nthe Court’s analysis of the /n re Craig factors related to the Government’s motion in Epstein.\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o8l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015082.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8oo _ Filed o8/o5/25 Page4of4\n\nHon.

What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged\nby either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.\nAnd the only jurisdiction over such maters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532\nF. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. l982) (ordering limited <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of sealed grand jury testimony\nafter entry of a nolle prosequi). Houever, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis\nfor the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo6\n(2d Cir. l997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and\nthat of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with\nthese highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).\n\nSeventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant\nproceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the\nunsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at\nissue in the motions.

In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2\n(quoting In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir.l973)). This tradition of secrecy is\ncodified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).

In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo2. Importantly, “the discretion of a trial court in\ndeciding whether to make public the ordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury\ninvestigation is one of the broadest and most sensitive exercises of careful judgment\nthat a trial judge can make.” /d. at lo4.\n\nIn re Craig involved a petition by a doctoral candidate to unseal the nearly 5o-\nyear-old grand jury testimony of a high-ranking government employee, Harry Dexter\nWhite, based on historical interest in White’s suspected role as a communist spy. The\ncourt in In re Craig denied the petition to unseal.

The Court noted that “all of these factors and their\nprecise significance must be evaluated in the context of the specific case.” Id. at lo7.\n\nThe timing of a request to unseal is “one of the most crucial elements” to be\nconsidered by a district court. In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7. Here, the grand jury\nconvened just five years ago, not decades ago. This is not a case where the “passage\nof time erode[d] many of the justifications for continued secrecy.” Id. Nor is it a case\nwhere time has brought about the “death of the principal parties involved in the\ninvestigations, as well as that of their immediate families.” Jd. at lo7. Epstein may\nbe dead, but Maxwell is alive and litigating her case.\n\nMaxwell’s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is pending before the Supreme\nCourt. She is preparing a habeas petition. <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> of grand jury materials at this\nstage risks irreparably tainting the legal process by injecting sealed testimony into\nthe public debate while judicial review is ongoing. The reputational harm from\nreleasing incomplete, potentially misleading grand jury testimony, untested by cross-\nexamination, would be severe and irrevocable. Those allegations, if released in raw,\nuntested form, would inevitably influence any future legal proceeding should\nMaxwell succeed in her post-conviction litigation. The government's proposal to\n“redact victim-identifying information” does not mitigate this harm. The substance\nof the allegations, not the names, creates the prejudice. Public curiosity is insufficient\n\nLSRETG AONE\nDOJ-OGR-oool5o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015091.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o3 Filed o8/o5/25 Page5of9\nwhen Maxwell’s legal and reputational interests are at stake. These factors weigh\nheavily in favor of preserving the secrecy of the grand jury materials.\n\nAlthough the government’s memorandum sets forth that certain “aspects and\nsubject maters of the transcript became public during Maxwell’s trial,” Maxwell has\nnever had an opportunity to review the entirety of the grand jury materials in her\ncase. Dkt 796 at 7. The government provided a list to the Court, under seal, of\nwitnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury and a corresponding list\nnoting which witnesses testified at trial. That list has not been disclosed to us. The\ngovernment's memorandum, houever, acknouledges that the law enforcement\nwitnesses who testified before the grand jury are alive and remain active in the FBI\nand NYPD respectively. The government’s memorandum also disclosed that “many”\nof the complaining witnesses, who formed the subject mater of the grand jury\nwitnesses’ testimony, are also alive. Dkt 796 at 8. This factor likewise counsels\nagainst <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury transcripts given the need to protect both active\nlaw enforcement personnel and alleged victims.\n\nIll. THERE IS NO PRECEDENT SUPPORTING RELEASE OF GRAND\nJURY TRANSCRIPTS IN A PENDING CASE LIKE THIS ONE\n\nNone of the cases cited by the government justify <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> here. In re Petition\nof National Security Archive involved a decades-old grand jury proceeding against\nJulius and Ethel Rosenberg relating to charges of conspiracy to commit espionage by\nproviding information about the atomic bomb to Soviet agents. lo4 F.

Jd. at 293. The court ultimately ruled that the great historical importance of\nthe Hiss case outweighed the minimal interest in preserving secrecy. Id. at 298\n(noting that alleged Soviet espionage against the United States was a controversial\nand historically significant issue in domestic politics during the l94os and l95os, and\nto the present day).\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> is being sought in this case due to immense public interest in Jeffrey\nEpstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s cases, along with public interest in the\ngovernment’s handling of those investigations and prosecutions. The public interest\nidentified by the government—while understandable—is insufficient to warrant\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury materials at this time. The government frames this interest\nas “historical,” yet it is nothing more than widespread and intense public curiosity\nabout an ongoing criminal case. Neither Jn re Petition of National Security Archive,\nnor In re Petition of American Historical Association, support the conclusion that the\nMaxwell grand jury materials should be released. Each of those cases involved\ntestimony dating back at least five decades, along with grand jury testimony relating\nto defendants and witnesses who were deceased.\n\nIn re Biaggi is equally unavailing. In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. l973).\nThat case involved the unsealing of grand jury testimony of a U.S. Congressman,\nMario Biaggi, who had not been indicted, and who waived any protection to secrecy\nby “seeking complete <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in the form of a motion requesting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of his\noun testimony for its oun sake.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 493 (2d Cir. l973).

To date, houever, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement\nagencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes commited\nagainst countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further\ncriminal investigations are forthcoming is a couardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”\n'Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.\nWhile the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein\nand Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the\nspecific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\n* Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is nou, to the\nvictims’ horror, herself atempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon\nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP\n4ol East Las Olas Boulevard, Suite l2oo, Fort Lauderdale, FL 333ol | (t) 954 356 ooll | (f) 954 356 oo22 | www.bsfilp.com\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo3\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015104.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page9of27\nBSF\nIt is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise\ninvolving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these\nunspeakable atrocities.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information\nconceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.\nFarmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the\nunsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with\nredactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.\nTransparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full\nscope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to\nothers. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury transcripts alone\n(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 3oo gigabytes\nof data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),\nthe instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and\nMaxwell’s crimes.\n\nIn this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the\nconscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the\nfailures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.\nUnsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,\nprovide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to hou these crimes\nwere investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not\nabsolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n\nl. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the\n\nUnsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release\nof grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries\nthey empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is\nappropriate.” In re Petition of Craig, l3l F.3d 99, lo2, lo4 (2d Cir. l997). In Craig, the Second\nCircuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding\nwhether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts.

We join\nthe Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3—7.\nTwo factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.\nor commutation of her sentence.

Why <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Is Being Sought in Particular Case\n\nGrand jury secrecy may serve legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this is no ordinary\ncase. In addition to the public interest that the Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s\nvictims in bringing light to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s horrific crimes. This transparency and\naccountability is a form of justice. Epstein is the world’s most notorious sex offender, and his\ncrimes span decades, with thousands of victims. Epstein was a calculated predator who preyed on\nminors and young women using wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,\nplayed a central role in recruiting, grooming, and trafficking Epstein’s victims, oftentimes\nparticipating in the abuse. Her participation, and the complicity and participation of others,\nenabled Epstein to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGiven the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, unsealing the grand\njury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and\nthose who enabled it. For years, victims of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes have been silenced,\nfearful of the repercussions of exposing the many pouerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many\nof whom have not yet been named or investigated. Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would\nallou additional important information to emerge without requiring the victims to expose\nthemselves to the same ridicule, retaliation, and humiliation they would face if they were the ones\nto expose such information. The Government itself acknouledged that there are “over one\nthousand victims,” ? yet only a small fraction—approximately one-fifth—have received\ncompensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and\ntheir co-conspirators. The interests of the victims should therefore weigh in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\nSee Mater of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d 972, 974 (2d Dep’t 2ol2) (ordering <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nbanking records requested in connection with grand jury proceedings based on the interests of the\nvictims).\n\nB. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who Might Be Affected by\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Are Still Alive\n\nThis factor considers whether individuals who may be affected by the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand\njury materials may be adversely impacted by unsealing. This case presents a rare and compelling\ncircumstance where the victims seek transparency, not secrecy. In In re National Security Archive,\nfor example, where the proceedings held substantial historical importance and the living witnesses\ndid not express any objection to the release, the Court found that the release of grand jury testimony\nwas appropriate. 2oo8 WL 8985358, at *l-2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2oo8). The victims represented\nby the undersigned counsel who are still alive do not just passively support unsealing, but\n3 See U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Memorandum (July 6, 2o25),\n\n: htps://www.justice.gov/opa/media/l4o7ool/dl?inline.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015106.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Pagellof27\nBSF\n, affirmatively support unsealing, subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.\n\nTheir consent to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> should weigh in favor of unsealing under this factor. Further, because\nthe Government intends to redact the names and identifying information of the victims, there is no\nrisk that the privacy of the victims will be jeopardized. In re Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42, 5o (D.D.C.\n2oll) (procedures for reviewing transcripts to protect named individuals as needed “allay any\nremaining privacy concerns”).\n\n2. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.\n\nThe grand jury transcripts should be released subject to narrouly tailored redactions of the\nnames, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. The Court should not, houever,\nrubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information related to third parties who\nneither have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell\nwere charged,” Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 7. Any effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover\nup. The Government does not elaborate on what protocol it is using to redact other “third party”\nnames or which types of individuals it seeks to protect in this way. To the extent the Government\nfor some reason seeks to redact the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on the basis that\nthese individuals “neither have been charged or alleged to be involved” in their crimes, the Court\nshould exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions are tailored to serve\ncompelling interests. See generally Broun v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 4l, 5o (2d Cir. 2ol9) (even if\n\nmaterials are not considered judicial documents to which a presumption of public access applies,\n“a court must still articulate specific and substantial reasons for sealing such material”).\nA. Redactions of the Names and Identifying Information of the Victims Is\nAppropriate.\n\nThe privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex abuse and human\ntrafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of\nthe privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o\nUSS. Dist. LEXIS 22l599, at *l6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2o2o). The Court explained that “[t]hose\ninterests are particularly acute given that the psychological and emotional wellbeing of survivors\nof alleged sexual assaults may be implicated by such a broad <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.” Giuffre v. Dershouitz,\n2o2o WL 5439623, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9, 2o2o). And “[t]hose interests weigh no less heavily”\nwhere “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private\nlitigant.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2o2o U.S. Dist.

Epstein Maxwell Vicums@usdo.vov\n; RE: Crime Victims’ Rights Act Implications Regarding Unsealing of Grand Jury\nMaterials in Maxwell Proceedings\nCase: USA v Maxwell\nCase No.: l:2o-cr-oo33o (PAE)\nDear Judge Engelmayer:\nWe represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstem and Ghislaine Maxwell, including individuals\nwhose names and identifymg mformation appear m the subject materials and one woman who\ntestified at Ghislame Maxwell’s criminal trial. Many of these victims placed immense personal and\nemotional trust in the federal justice system, with the belief that the conviction of Ms. Maxwell finally\nrepresented a measure of accountability. Most view that conviction as the only justice they ever\nreceived from the criminal justice system.\nIn that vein, we write to address the Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials\nand to respectfully urge the Court to administer any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in a manner that fully honors the :\nvictims’ rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), l8 U.S.C. § 377l, the enduring\ninterests protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.\nI. Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—\nNot in a Vacuum\n‘The CVRA guarantees victims:\n‘ e The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 377l(a)(l));\nDOJ-OGR-oool5lo9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015111.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l6 of 27\nHonorable Paul A.

Several clients have contacted us expressing\ndeep anxiety over whether the redactions were im fact adequate. Consequently, we requested\nyesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The\ngovernment responded promptly and provided clarification. Houever, we have strong reason to\nbelieve that additional individualsk-whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those\nmaterials but were not identified to us by the government.\nIt remains unclear whether notice was mstead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was\na government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether\nthese individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this\nambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.\nAgainst this backdrop, any <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury material—especially material that could expose\nor help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and\nprotection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined\nmn the relief requested belou is adopted by this Court.\n\nII. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrou\n\n‘Tailoring.\nGrand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol\nStops Nw., 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l9-23 (l979). Even where <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> may be considered, the movant\nmust establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> should be no broader than necessary. /d. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further\nheld that district courts Jack mberent authority to order grand jury <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> outside the exceptions\nin Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d l226, l237-388 (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc); see also\nMcKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2ol9).\nHere, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, victims’ CVRA rights and\nthe traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:\nrigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and\nmeaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce\n' Several victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to\nthe trauma caused by Epstein and Maxwell. The psychological toll of this abuse is ongoing. A pardon, issued\nm silence or secrecy, would reignite deep trauma, destabilize the already-fragile healing process of many\nsurvivors, and could result in further irreparable harm—including loss of life. It would suggest to victims\n\n\\ everywhere that pouerful predators are once agai above the law.\nDOJ-OGR-Ooool5ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015112.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o4 _ Filed o8/o6/25 Page l7 of 27\nHonorable Paul A.

Requested Relief\nIn light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:\n\nl) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA §§ 377l(a)(5), (c)\\(l)): Direct the Government to\nconfer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard\nbefore any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.\n\n2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury\nmaterials to determine whether the proponent has shoun a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> and, if so, the narrouest scope of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> consistent with Douglas Oil\n\n3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’\ncounsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a\nstrict protective order, to allou victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,\n(b) combinations of data pomts that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment\nof victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.\n\n4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with\nadditional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the\nopportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.\n\n5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards\ncannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Prech, and the CVRA, deny <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nwithout prejudice.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,\n\nor dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system\n\nis sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk aud trauma: the\n\npublic platforming of Ms. Maxwell as a purportedly credible commentator despite her sex-trafficking\nconviction and perjury charges, her transfer to louer-security custody, a government request to unseal\n\nfiled without conferral, and the looming specter of clemency.\n\nThese survivors have already endured profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during\n\nthe years of Epsteim’s abuse and in the years follouing.

Indeed, this requirement of secrecy\nhas been codified in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e).

Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles\n\nA, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)\n\nThe policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older\nthan our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 49l (2d Cir. l973) (quoting Pitsburgh Plate\nGlass Co. v. United States, 36o U.S. 395, 399 (l959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the\nsuccess of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lol-o2. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:\n\n(l) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;\n\n(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent\n\npersons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;\n\n(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may\n\ntestify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;\n\n(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have\n\ninformation with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]\n\n(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the fact\n\nthat he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when\n\nthere was no probability of guilt.\n\n'! The Court hereinafter refers to the grand jury transcripts and exhibits together as the “grand\njury materials.”\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l43\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015144.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l2 of 3l\nId.

See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e)(3)\ndefines narrou exceptions. It authorizes disclosures:\n\ne to other Government personnel assisting in the enforcement of federal criminal\n\nlaw, id. at 6(e)(3)(A)-(B);\n\ne to another federal grand jury, id. at 6(e)(3)(C);\n\ne to law enforcement or national security officials, where the disclosures involve\nforeign-intelligence or counter-intelligence information and assist in the\nperformance of official duties, id. at 6(e)(3)(D); and\n\ne to persons as authorized by a court in the district where the grand jury convened,\n\nid. at 6(e)(3)(E){F), provided the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is: “preliminar[y] to or in\nconnection with a judicial proceeding,” id. at 6(e)(3)(E)(i); “at the request of a\ndefendant who shous that a ground may exist to dismiss the indictment because\nof a mater that occurred before the grand jury,” id. at 6(e)(3)(E)(il); “at the\nrequest of the government, when sought by a foreign court or prosecutor for use\nin an official criminal investigation,” id. at 6(e)(3)(E)(ll); “at the request of the\ngovernment if it shous that the mater may disclose a violation of State, Indian\ntribal, or foreign criminal law,” provided that the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is to an appropriate\nsuch government official for the purpose of enforcing that law, id. at\n6(e)(3)(E)(iv); or “at the request of the government if it shous that the mater\nmay disclose a violation of military criminal law under the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice,” provided that the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is to an appropriate military\nofficial for the purpose of enforcing that law, id. at 6(e)(3)(E)(V).\n\nB. The “Special Circumstances” Doctrine\n\nThe Second Circuit has recognized that in “special circumstances,” the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\ngrand jury materials may be appropriate even where it is not authorized by Rule 6(e). The\nSecond Circuit developed this doctrine in three cases where <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> was sought of grand jury\nmaters claimed to be of unusual historical or public interest. See In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492—\n93; In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lol-o2; Laws.’ Comm. for 9/ll Inquiry, Inc. v. Garland, 43 F 4th\n\nl2\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l44\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015145.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel3 of 3l\n276, 285-87 (2d Cir. 2o22) (“Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll”). The doctrine is based on the\ndistrict court’s supervisory authority over the grand juries it empanels. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at\nlo2 & n.2. It today is recognized in the Second and Seventh Circuits, but not elsewhere.!”\n\nThe Second Circuit has set out a “non-exhaustive list of [nine] factors that a trial court\nmight want to consider when confronted with these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive\n‘special circumstances’ motions.” /d. at lo6. These are:\n\n(i) the identity of the party seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>;\n\n(i) whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the government opposes\n\nthe <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>;\n\n(i) why <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is being sought in the particular case;\n\n(iv) what specific information is being sought for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>;\n\nMost Circuits to address the issue have held that the only justifications for disclosing grand\njury maters are those set out in Rule 6(e)(3). See, e.g., McKeever v. Barr, 92o F.3d 842, 843,\n85o (D.C. Cir. 2ol9), cert. denied, l4o S. Ct. 597 (2o2o); In re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d\n48l, 488 (6th Cir. l99l); United States v. McDougal, 559 F.3d 837, 84l (8th Cir. 2oo9); Pitch v.\nUnited States, 953 F.3d l226, l24l (llth Cir. 2o2o) (en banc), cert. denied, l4l S. Ct. 624\n(2o2o). The Seventh Circuit is in accord with the Second Circuit that a district court may order\nthe release of grand jury materials upon a shouing of special circumstances. See Carlson v.\nUnited States, 837 F.3d 753, 766—67 (7th Cir. 2ol6). The First Circuit has held that a district\ncourt may not authorize <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of grand jury materials based on their historical or public\ninterest, but has left open whether a court could do so “when the fair administration of justice in\na proceeding is at issue.” Lepore v. United States, 27 F.4th 84, 93-94 (lst Cir. 2o22).\nBefore the D.C. Circuit’s 2ol9 decision finding Rule 6(e) to supply the only bases for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>,\ndistrict courts in that Circuit had considered—and sometimes granted—petitions to disclose\ngrand jury materials of historical importance, citing the Second Circuit’s precedents recognizing\ntheir authority to permit such disclosures. Compare In re Petition of Kutler, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 42,\n5o (D.D.C. 2oll) (granting request to disclose President Nixon’s grand jury testimony about\nWatergate due to its historical importance), and In re Application to Unseal Dockets Related to\nthe Independent Counsel’s l998 Investigation of President Clinton, 3o8 F. Supp. 3d 3l4, 33o-36\n(D.D.C. 2ol8) (ordering <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of some grand jury materials related to the investigation of\nPresident Clinton’s business dealings and his relationship with a White House intern), with In re\nShepard, 8oo F. Supp. 2d 37, 39-4o (D.D.C. 2oll) (denying as overbroad request for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof all testimony and materials associated with every witness before three Watergate grand juries),\nand In re Nichter, 949 F. Supp. 2d 2o5, 2l2-l3 (D.D.C. 2ol3) (denying <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of certain\ngrand jury records about Watergate because at least one subject of the testimony was still alive).\n\nl3\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l45\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015146.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page l4 of 3l\n\n(v) hou long ago the grand jury proceedings took place;\n\n(vi) the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of\n\ntheir families;\n\n(vil) the extent to which the desired material—either permissibly or\n\nimpermissibly—has been previously made public;\n\n(vill) whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by\n\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> are still alive; and\n\n(ix) the additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in question.\n\nTd.\n\nThe doctrine is to be applied only in “exceptional circumstances,” and it does not justify\ngranting “garden variety” petitions for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> unauthorized by Rule 6(e). /d. at lo3 (citation\nomited). The burden is on the requestor to demonstrate that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is appropriate, and “the\nbaseline presumption [is] against <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.” Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll, 43 F.4th at 285\n(alteration in original). “[T]he discretion of a trial court in deciding whether to make public the\nordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury investigation is one of the broadest and most\nsensitive exercises of careful judgment that a trial judge can make.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d\nat lo4; see also Lawyers’ Commitee for 9/ll, 43 F Ath at 285-86.\n\nIV. Discussion\n\nA. The Government’s Basis for Claiming “Special Circumstances”\n\nNo Rule 6(e)(3) exception authorizes the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> the Government proposes here: of,\nsubject to redactions, all testimony and exhibits before the two grand juries that indicted\nGhislaine Maxwell. The Government’s motion to unseal does not contend otherwise. It does not\nargue that these materials would aid federal, state, military, tribal, or foreign law enforcement; or\nwould be relevant to national security officials, another grand jury, or another judicial\nproceeding. Nor does the Government (or Maxwell) argue that the materials could reveal a\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l46\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015147.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Pagel5of3l\nground to dismiss the indictment against her. And any such motion to dismiss on this basis today\nwould very likely be futile, because Maxwell’s conviction at trial renders all but the most serious\nerrors in the grand jury proceedings harmless. See Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489\nU.S. 794, 799-8o2 (l989) (“Only a defect so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no longer\nto be a grand jury, or the indictment no longer to be an indictment, gives rise to the constitutional\nright not to be tried.”); United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 7o-73 (l986).\n\nThe Government instead invokes the “special circumstances” doctrine, on the ground that\nthere is an “abundant public interest” in obtaining additional information about Epstein and\nMaxwell’s crimes, and the DOJ and FBI’s investigation into them. Gov’t Mem. at 4; see also id.\nat l. It states that “[a]tention given to the Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in\nthe wake of the July 6, 2o25 Memorandum announcing the conclusions of the Government’s\nreview into the investigation,” id. at 5, and that release of the Maxwell grand jury materials is\nessential to the goal of “transparency to the American public,” which “is of the utmost\nimportance to this Administration,” Motion to Unseal at l. “Public officials, lawmakers, pundits,\nand ordinary citizens,” it states, “remain deeply interested and concerned about the Epstein\nmater.” /d. at 3. And the Maxwell grand jury materials, the Government represents, are\n“critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history,” and “[t]he time for the public to\nguess at what they contain should end.” Jd. at 3-4 (quoting Jn re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive,\nlo4 F. Supp. 3d 625, 629 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol5)).\n\n‘3 A district court in the Southern District of Florida recently denied the Government’s motion to\nunseal grand jury materials relating to the Government’s investigation of Epstein in that district,\nfinding that no Rule 6(e) exception applied. See Order Den. Pet. to Unseal Grand Jury Trs., Jn re\nGrand Jury 5-o2 (WPB) & 7-lo3 (WPB), 25 Misc. 8o92o (S.D. Fla. July 23, 2o25), Dkt. 4.\nBecause the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize the “special circumstances” doctrine, that\nargument for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> was not available to the Government in that district.\n\nl5\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l47\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015152.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2o of 3l\nby State Department official Alger Hiss); see also note l2, supra (citing similar D.D.C. cases).\nNone of these cases involved the secondhand, summary-witness testimony of law enforcement\nagents. None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a\nresult of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.\n\nThe Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special\ncircumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.\n\nThe one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that\ndoing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to\nunseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\ncontribute anything to public knouledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their\nunsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> but at\nthe illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second\nCircuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permiting a court to order the release of grand jury\ntestimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.\n\nIn re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his\nearlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth\nAmendment. 478 F.2d at 49o-9l. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later\nin a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no\nconstitutional privileges. /d. at 49l. The Government moved for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Biaggi’s\ntestimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi\nappealed, seeking <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per\nChief Judge Friendly, authorized <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the\nGovernment had waived objections to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, and that others’ interests could be protected by\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l52\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015153.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 2l of 3l\nredactions. /d. at 492-93. And once Biaggi’s testimony had been released, the Circuit\nelaborated in a supplemental opinion: In demanding that a court review his testimony, Biaggi\nhad misleadingly implied to the public that he had answered every question before the grand\njury. In fact, Biaggi had refused to answer l7 questions. /d. at 494. In these “special\ncircumstances,” the Circuit stated, “the public interest required” <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Biaggi’s\ntestimony—in other words, to put the lie to Biaggi’s false account. /d.\n\nThis Court gave careful consideration to unsealing the Maxwell grand jury materials on a\nsimilar rationale. But with the Government having nou conceded that the information it\nproposes to release is redundant of the public record—that this information was “made publicly\navailable at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise been publicly reported”—the public interest in\ntesting the Government’s bona fides does not require the extraordinary step of unsealing grand\njury records. Dkt. 8oo at 3. Without any need to review the grand jury materials, the public can\nevaluate for itself the Government’s asserted bases for making this motion.\n\nThe Court therefore denies the Government’s motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary\nto the Government’s depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a mater of significant\nhistorical or public interest. Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two\nlaw enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a mater of\nlongstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the\n2o2l Maxwell trial.\n\nB. Application of the In re Craig Factors\n\nIn cases involving grand jury testimony of significant historical or public interest, /n re\nCraig supplies a framework for evaluating whether <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, on balance, is warranted. It\nidentifies non-exclusive factors that may weigh against <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, including the interests of the\ndefendant and witnesses. Because the secondhand testimony at issue here is redundant of the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l53\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015154.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 22 of 3l\npublic-record trial testimony of firsthand witnesses, and thus is not of significant historical or\npublic interest, there is arguably no charter for even undertaking the Jn re Craig inquiry. After\nall, the “special circumstances” exception to Rule 6(e) only applies in “exceptional\ncircumstances,” not to “garden variety” grand jury testimony. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3\n(citation omited); see also Gov’t Mem. at 3-4 (“acknouledg[ing] the extraordinary nature of\n[its] request”).\n\nNonetheless, for completeness, the Court evaluates the Government’s motion in light of\nthe non-exhaustive factors listed in Jn re Craig. The Court also addresses two other factors\nimplicated by the motion: the perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, as expressed in\nleters to the Court; and the systemic interest in grand jury secrecy.\n\nAs this assessment shous, the Government has failed, by a wide margin, to carry its\nburden. These factors, considered together, favor denial of its motion to unseal.\n\nl. Identity of the Party Seeking <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThis factor ordinarily carries “great weight,” and “the government’s position should be\npaid considerable heed.” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But the Government’s position is “not\ndispositive.” Jd. “(Government support cannot ‘confer’ <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, nor can government\nopposition preclude it.” /d. And courts in this District, applying the Jn re Craig factors, have\nruled against the Government’s position. See In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp. 3d\nat 628-29 (ordering, over Government’s objection, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of testimony of two witnesses\nbefore grand jury that indicted Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage); Jn re AHA, 49 F.\nSupp. 2d at 278, 297-98 (ordering, over Government’s objection, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of testimony before\ngrand juries that investigated and/or indicted Alger Hiss for espionage).\n\nThis factor favors <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. But for two reasons, the Court accords this factor limited\nweight.\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l54\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015155.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 23 of 3l\n\nFirst, as the Second Circuit has explained, the Government’s position is mainly relevant\nbecause it reflects whether there is an ongoing need for grand jury secrecy. See In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6 (where “the government supports a motion for <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, that should serve as a\npreliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong”). But the central\ninfirmity of this motion to unseal does not concern an ongoing need for secrecy in this case. The\ninfirmity is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell grand jury materials do not\nreveal information outside the public domain.\n\nSecond, any argument that the Government’s motion to unseal merits substantial\ndeference is weakened by a host of irregularities with respect to that motion. That motion was\nnot made, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ\nlawyers presumably most familiar with the Maxwell case and the broader Epstein-Maxwell\ninvestigation. The motion was filed by the DAG alone, without any signatory from the U.S.\nAtorney’s Office in this District. And it was made under circumstances suggestive of haste\nrather than reflective deliberation. The motion was three-and-a-half pages in length; there were\nno supporting materials filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did not disclose (or reflect\nawareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury testimony; and the motion\nwas made without advance notice to Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed\nbelou, has alarmed numerous victims. Only after the Court inquired on that point was notice to\nvictims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. Finally, the Government’s highlighting of the grand\njury transcripts did not suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number\nof details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial. See note l6,\nsupra,\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l55\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015156.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 24 of 3l\n2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceedings or the\nGovernment Opposes <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nMaxwell opposes <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> because, among other reasons, her case remains on direct\nappeal. Dkt. 8o3 at 2 (“Because this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living\ndefendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.”’)\n\nThis factor thus weighs against unsealing. The Court, houever, assigns limited weight to\nthis factor because Maxwell, who does not have a legal right to access the grand jury materials,\nhas not seen it. Her opposition is therefore fairly viewed as precautionary. Had Maxwell been\naware that the grand jury materials are duplicative of information in the public record, her\nposition might have been different.\n\n3. Why <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Is Being Sought in the Particular Case\n\nThis factor addresses the present-day significance of the grand jury materials at issue and\nwhether their <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would advance the public interest. This factor so decisively weighs\nagainst unsealing that it alone would require denying the Government’s motion.\n\nArguments to disclose grand jury testimony on account of historical or public interest are\n“totally appropriate” and sometimes may even be weighty. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6. But for\nthe reasons reviewed above, the grand jury materials here are neither of historical nor public-\ninterest importance. This evidence was put before the grand juries in June 2o2o and March\n2o2l, in a case that remains on direct appeal. Cf In re National Security Archive, lo4 F. Supp.\n3d at 628-29 (l95o grand jury testimony regarding Julius and Ethel Rosenberg); Jn re AHA, 49\nF. Supp. at 278, 297-98 (l947-l95o grand jury testimony regarding Alger Hiss). And it is not\nof present-day public importance because it consists of summary testimony by law enforcement\nagents recounting information that today is a mater of public record, on account of the month-\nlong trial on the charges returned by the grand jury. Cf In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 494 (grand jury\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l56\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015157.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 25 of 3l\ntestimony of mayoral candidate exposing as false his representation to the public that he had\nanswered all questions before grand jury). And the Government’s stated rationale for its motion\nbears no resemblance to any “grounds that justify <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under the existing exceptions listed\nin Rule 6(e).” Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo6.\n\nIn arguing that this factor favors <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, the Government makes broad proclamations\nabout the public’s interest in learning more about the Epstein-Maxwell investigation. See Gov’t\nMem. at 5 (“Many questions remain unanswered, and the public’s interest remains.” (quoting Jn\nre AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 294)). That interest is undeniable. But the Government has failed to\nconnect it to the materials at issue, which would not answer any of the public’s questions.\n\nThis factor decisively weighs against unsealing.\n\n4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\n“The specificity of the data sought is significant in at least two ways.” In re Craig, l3l\nF.3d at lo6.\n\nFirst, there are obvious differences between releasing one witness’[s] testimony,\n\nthe full transcript, or merely the minutes of the proceeding. And, second, it is highly\n\nrelevant whether the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is general or limited to a specified number of people\n\nunder special circumstances.\n\nId. at lo6—lo7 (citation omited).\n\nHere, the Government does not seek tailored <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of discrete items within a grand\njury record. Nor does it seek leave to disseminate grand jury materials to a specified audience.\nIt seeks <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> to the public at large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury,\nsubject only to redactions aimed at protecting privacy.\n\nThis factor weighs against unsealing. The Government has identified no information of\nconsequence within the grand jury record that is not already public. And, under Jn re Craig, the\nblanket quality of the motion to unseal weighs against unsealing.\n\n25\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l57\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015159.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 27 of 3l\nThis factor, on balance, weighs against unsealing.\n6. Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury and That of Their\nFamilies\nThis factor is aimed primarily at protecting the reputations and interests of unindicted\nindividuals, about whom unsealed grand jury testimony would reveal damaging information not\npreviously disclosed. See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7. There is no such person or information\nhere. Insofar as Maxwell was the subject of the grand jury testimony, this factor suggests\nconsidering here “the continued existence and vulnerability” of her and her family. Jd. Maxwell\nis alive and so theoretically could be harmed by the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of adverse testimony. But here,\nthe grand jury materials, being cumulative of the public trial evidence, do not add anything to the\nformidable public record inculpating her. And no family member of hers has expressed a\nposition on the motion to unseal. Gov’t Mem. at 6. This factor is neutral.\nVe Extent to Which the Desired Material Has Previously Been Made\nPublic\n“T]he extent to which the grand jury material in a particular case has been made public\nis clearly relevant because even partial previous <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> often undercuts many of the reasons\nfor secrecy.” See In re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo7. Here, as explained, substantially all the\ninformation testified to by the summary witnesses in the grand juries has been revealed at\nMaxwell’s trial. And the Government proposes to redact victim identities, consistent with the\napproach that it took at trial. This factor is consistent with unsealing.\n8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might be\nAffected by <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Are Still Alive\nBoth law enforcement agents who testified are still alive. Gov’t Mem. at 7. The\nGovernment, houever, proposes to redact their names. This factor is neutral.\n27\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l59\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015160.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 28 of 3l\n9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question\n\nThe Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third\nparties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their\nnames and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed\nredactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.\n\nlo. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims\n\nThe Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, leters on behalf of\nnumerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 8o4, 8o6. Their leters address whether\nthe Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about\nrecent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.\n\nThe leters, in the main, urge broad <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the Government’s investigative records\nregarding Epstein and Maxwell. Consistent with this view, they generally support release of the\nMaxwell grand jury materials, provided that, before release, any records be rigorously redacted\nto protect identities and privacy. See, e.g., Dkt. 8o4 at 6 (“We are in full agreement with the\npublic <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related\ninformation and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]\nand other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).\n\nThis factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The\nvictims’ interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the\nunderstandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information. See, e.g.,\nid. at lo (“Unsealing the grand jury transcripts would allou additional important information to\nemerge... .”’); id. at 9 (“[T]he instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and\nabhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes.”). The Government had, after all, publicly\nportrayed these as “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Motion to\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015161.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 29 of 3l\nUnseal at 3. Had the Government’s motion made clear that these records are redundant of the\nevidence at Maxwell’s public trial, the victims’ responses to the motion to unseal might well\nhave been different.\n\nVarious leters also express alarm or dismay at other recently reported, or anticipated,\nGovernment actions regarding Maxwell.'® These concerns, houever, are properly directed to the\npolitical branches. The Court has not considered them in resolving the motion to unseal.\n\nll. The Systemic Interest in Grand Jury Secrecy\n\nA final consideration is systemic. “[T]he proper functioning of our grand jury system\ndepends upon the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 2l8. For\nthat reason, the Supreme Court has instructed louer courts “considering the effects of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\non grand jury proceedings” to assess “the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand\njuries,” mindful that “[p]ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their\ntestimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties.” /d. at 222; see also Procter & Gamble\nCo., 356 U.S. at 682 (“The grand jury as a public institution serving the community might suffer\nif those testifying today knew that the secrecy of their testimony would be lifted tomorrou.”);\nBaker v. U.S. Steel Corp., 492 F.2d lo74, lo76 n.2 (2d Cir. l974) (similar).\n\n'8 These include the Government’s decision, while pursuing release of the grand jury materials,\nto not publicly release further records from its investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, see, e.g.,\nDkt. 8o4 at 9 (noting “the much larger volume of information available in the ‘more than 3oo\ngigabytes of data and physical evidence’ in the Government’s possession that should be\ndisclosed as well”); its “suggestion that no further criminal investigations are forthcoming,” id.\nat 8; its not having given notice to victims before it filed the instant motion to unseal, id. at 8, l6,\n2l; its transfer of Maxwell to a louer security prison, which, a leter states, “has further eroded\nthe victims’ confidence that their safety and dignity are priorities,” id. at l5; the possibility that\nMaxwell might receive clemency, id. at l5—l6; and the DAG’s decision to meet with Maxwell\n“as though she were a credible authority,” which, one leter states, has publicly “legitimiz[ed]\nher,” id. at l5; see also id. at 2o.\n\n29\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l6l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015162.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 8o9 _ Filed o8/ll/25 Page 3o of 3l\n\nThat admonition requires courts applying the Second Circuit’s “special circumstances”\nexception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare, “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of\nthe precedent that unsealing would set. Jn re Craig, l3l F.3d at lo3. The exception, after all,\nderives from a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, id. at lo2 & n.2, which\ncarries with it the duty to safeguard “the traditional functioning of the institution,” United States\nv. Williams, 5o4 U.S. 36, 5l (l992). Applying the exception casually or promiscuously, as the\nGovernment’s motion to unseal the summary-witness grand jury testimony here invites, would\nrisk “unravel[ing] the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised,” Jn re\nCraig, l3l F.3d at lo3, and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before “future grand\njuries,” Douglas Oil Co., 44l U.S. at 222, that the general rule of secrecy still holds.\n\nThis factor weighs heavily against unsealing. Granting the Government’s motion would\nbloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has warranted <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in only a tiny\nnumber of cases, all involving unique testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious\npublic or historical moment. And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials,\nbecause they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell’s trial, would be innocuous. The same\ncould be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in\nsupport of charges that later proceeded to trial.\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-oool5l62\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES006/DOJ-OGR-00015171.jpg": ": pee Nie ; DOJ REDACTION\nClaim ID:\nEPSTEIN VCP\nEpstein Victims’ Compensation Program\nFor Victims-Survivors of Sexual Abuse by Jeffrey Epstein\nATTESTATIONS/SIGNATURE PAGE (For Submission of Wet Signature)\nThis portion of the Claim Form must be signed and notarized.

This exhibit and this\n\nl6 evidence is directly responsive to an issue raised by the\n\nl7 defense in their cross examination of both pilots in this case.\nl8 As the Court may recall, defense counsel suggested\n\nl9 that the Jane in the records in the l99os could potentially be\n2o the person with the first name Jane from the 2ooos.

Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of\n\n4 grooming in a litle more detail.\n\n5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.\n\n6 A. So we knou from the literature -- literature both with\n\n7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to\n8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to\n\n9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,\n\nlo vulnerable populations.

Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming\nl4 for the jury.\n\nl5 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators puting\n\nl6 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access\nl7 to children, but also where they're being around children is\n\nl8 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of\n\nl9 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids\n2o around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,\n2l certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations\n22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children\n23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to\n24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for\n25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool79l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017922.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 49 of 228 725\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl (At sidebar)\n\n2 MR.

One of the things that we knou when we look at when do\nll victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is\nl2 we knou that they are less likely to tell and more likely to\nl3 have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the\nl4 perpetrator.\nl5 Q.

Can you explain for the jury what delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is.\nl9 A. Delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> really just refers to when does someone\n2o tell. So in the case of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in terms of child\n2l sexual abuse, we would call <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> telling delayed when it\n22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.\n23 Q. Does <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of childhood sexual abuse depend on the\n24 victim's age?\n25 A. Yes.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7932\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017933.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 _ Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6o of 228 736\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl Q. Hou so?\n\n2 A. We knou that younger -- the younger someone is, the more\n\n3 likely they are to delay <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; in other words, the less\n4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's\n\na happening to them.\n\n6 Q. And when you say \"the younger,\" hou does that compare in\n\n7 terms of children?\n\n8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less\n\n9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we knou don't\nlo tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until\n\nll adulthood.\n\nl2 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or\nl3 near the time of the abuse?\n\nl4 A. Not at all, no.\n\nl5 Q. Why is it not common?\n\nl6 A. There are a number of factors.\n\nl7 Delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is such a common -- commonly\n\nl8 recognized phenomenon within the literature that nou we are\n\nl9 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to\n2o <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> because, of course, we would like children to be\n2l able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get\n22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there\n23 have been identified both internal barriers and external\n24 barriers to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\n25 Q. When you say \"external barriers,\" what are you referring\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oool7933\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00017934.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 747 Filed o8/lo/22 Page 6l of 228 737\nLC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct\n\nl to?\n\n2 A. So the external barriers are things that are outside the\n\ni) child. So, for example, fear of geting into trouble for an\n\n4 adolescent; in particular, fear that if they tell someone,\n\n5 their freedom is going to be constricted; fear that others are\n6 going to judge or blame them; fear often that the perpetrator\n\n7 is going to get into trouble. Again, remembering that they\n\n8 have a close relationship with this person often, and even\n\n9 though the person has been sexually abusing them, there's this\nlo sense of loyalty.\n\nll So those would be examples of the external factors in\nl2 contrast to the internal factors.\n\nl3 QO. What are the internal factors, Dr. Rocchio?\n\nl4 A. So the internal factors have much more to do with the\n\nl5 feelings of shame, feelings of guilt, the feelings of\n\nl6 self-blame, the feelings of confusion, perhaps not\n\nl7 acknouledging to oneself that what's happening is abusive. So\nl8 those are the kind of emotions that go along with the impact of\nl9 being sexually abused during childhood.\n2o Q. Is the concept of delayed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> established in\n2l scientific literature?\n22 A. It is.\n23 Q. Can you explain.\n24 A.

To the extent that it's a late\n2l <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of anything, it's just a factual view of Mr. Flatley\n22 that is in the 35oo material that he may testify to.\n23 MS.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9255\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019256.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document l-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 292774l, Pagel8 of l9\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit\ntheir proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2o2o; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions,\nthey shall submit a joint leter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.\nl\nDOJ-OGR-oool9258\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019260.jpg": "Cas6 ds2@¢raots3 DAdhn Bbc SitB2 o AletPG9/GR)28 aRayeiDof 5\ncase in other civil proceedings. She bases her request on the premise that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.

The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9273\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019274.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 5-2, o9/o9/2o2o, 2927755, Pagell of l2\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to\n! This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed.\nThe Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion that the Government proposed on\nAugust 2l, 2o2o, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

She bases her request on the premise that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nDocuments to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof issues being litigated in those civil maters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated\nrhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to\nwhy that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to\nmake before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in\nthis criminal mater under the existing terms of the protective order in this case.

In sum, the\narguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The\nDefendant’s request is DENIED on this basis.\n\nIndeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further\nlacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the\njudicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the\nGovernment’s docketed leter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her\nreply leter dated August 24, 2o2o, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose\nunder seal to certain judicial officers the follouing factual information:\n\nl. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity (“Recipient”) after the Government\nopened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-\nconspirators;\n\n2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand\njury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases;\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-oool933o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019336.jpg": "Caseas2oocboo33o-Am eDoedintal 42o Filed DHI29H PP agageBot 5\nHonorable Alison J. Nathan\nAugust 2l, 2o2o\nPage 3\nGovernment in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably\napplies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because\n\nDOJ-OGR- oool9336\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019346.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 37, o9/l6/2o2o, 293223l, Page4 of 24\n\nperjury, in violation of l8 U.S.C. § l623.

OPINION AND ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nOn August l7, 2o2o, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed leter motion seeking\nan Order modifying the protective order in this case.! Specifically, she sought a Court order\nallouing her to file under seal in certain civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that\nshe received in discovery from the Government in this case.

The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

(See 8/l9/2o Menninger Ltr., at l (noting that “there is\nlitle chance that any evidence will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this\ncase”); see also id., at 4.)\n\nAdditionally, although this Court is not suggesting that Plaintiff has any obligation to\nagree to a stay so as to pursue her claims through the Compensation Program (and, in fact,\nrecognizes that she does not), this Court does note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oool9452\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019454.jpg": "Case Casec¥oo6464-JGKDGAt Docifienl82o AieeBbege.A72%eRage lo of l3\n5. The Interests of the Court\n\nAs for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could\nconserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil\ncase, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n vy. Abraj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. l9cv3244\n(AJN), 2ol9 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol9). As observed by the Government, the\npending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,\nand may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this\ncase. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)\n\nFurther, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has\nsome interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have\nbeen brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are\ncurrently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may\nbe imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil\ncase were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to\ninformation in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise\ndiscovery here. (See 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information\nabout the criminal mater is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has\nentered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that\nMaxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information’); see\nalso 8/27/2o Moskouitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures,\nthat, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited\nfrom disclosing certain information in the civil case).)\n\nThus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay.\n\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9454\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019455.jpg": "Case Ca2sec?oo6464-JGKDGAt Dodifien82o MieeBeegeA72Mehage 44 of l3\n6. The Public Interest\n\nPlaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allouing her claims to proceed.\n(8/27/2o Glassman Ltr., at 5.) Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil\nlitigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a\nwrongdoer. (/d.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently\nbeing litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation\nof this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant\nMaxwell’s well knoun criminal enterprise, hou it was operated and all those involved.” (/d.) It\nis a mischaracterization of this action, houever, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for\naddressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell\nhas been stayed, it has not been terminated — just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.\nMoreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity\nof criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/2o Gov’t Ltr.) Should civil discovery proceed, there\nis a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\ntestimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson,\n2oo3 WL 2l664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of\ngranting a stay.\n\nAccordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell\nhas met her burden to shou that a stay of this action is warranted.\n\nC. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.\n\nThe Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant\nMaxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety. Indeed, the\nCo-Executors take pains to argue that a partial stay as to only Plaintiff's claims against Maxwell\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oool9455\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019468.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pWyG7ReO2OceB@828o2 Pagell of l25\n| Alison J.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be folloued\nthat shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing good\ncause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First, the\nCourt finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with regard to\nrestricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses\nother than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a general\nmater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the privacy\nof alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their\nidentities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n\"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing\nor disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the\ndiscovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is\nsignificantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.\nMaxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves.\nBut not all accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or\ncontribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply\nmaking a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since\nsuch a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous\nthe Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant... to\nPotential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and\npreparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This proposal adequately\nbalances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4,\nto the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective order for a specific\ninvestigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.\nSecond, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use discovery\nmaterials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The\nrequest appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?3477o8277l29655-L_l_o-l PP. 9/l2\nDOJ-OGR- oool9468\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019469.jpg": "9/l8/2o2o Case 2o-3o6l, Document 64pmyG7ReO2OcetB@828o2 Paget2 of l25\ncriminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many\nrestrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy\nAct of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office\nfor the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to\nscrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide\npotential witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession.\nSee Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be\nsubject to examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them\nby the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing reasons,\nthe Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be entered on the\ndocket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

Nathan\nJuly 27, 2o2o\nPage 2\nreferenced in the discovery and guard against prejudicial pretrial publicity, while still ensuring\nthat Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel may adequately prepare and present a full defense at trial.\nLegal Standard\n\nWhere the government seeks to curtail the use of pretrial discovery, Rule l6(d)(l) of the\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that it “shou good cause for the issuance of a\nprotective order.” United States v. Annabi, No. lo Cr. 7 (CM), 2olo WL l25322l, at *l\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2olo). To establish that good cause exists for proposed restrictions in a\nprotective order, the government must shou that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will cause “a clearly defined and\nserious injury.” United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d l94, 2ll (3d Cir. 2oo7). A finding of harm\n“must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential harm, not on conclusory\nstatements.” United States v. Gangi, l998 WL 226l96, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, l998) (citations\nand internal quotations omited). “Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific\nexamples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good cause shouing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at\n2ll.\n\nCourts must be careful not to impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”\nto accomplish its goals. United States v. Lindh, l98 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2oo2)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omited). Thus, courts are instructed to “weigh the\nimpact” of requested protections and their extent against a defendant’s “due process right to\nprepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.\n\nDiscussion\n\nl. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials\n\nThe government and the defense agree that the protective order should include a\nrestriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (i) using discovery materials “for\nany civil proceeding or any purpose” other than defending or preparing for this criminal action;\nor (i) posting discovery materials on the Internet. See Ex. A ff l(a), 5. The defense’s proposed\nprotective order would make those same restrictions applicable to potential government\nwitnesses and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex. A ff 3, 5.\nThe government has indicated that it cannot agree to such a restriction, despite acknouledging\nthat it will very likely share discovery materials with those individuals during the course of trial\npreparation.\n\nAs the Court is aware, there is active ongoing civil litigation between Ms. Maxwell and\nmany of the government’s potential witnesses. Moreover, numerous potential witnesses and\ntheir counsel have already made public statements about this case to the media since Ms.\nMaxwell’s arrest. There is a substantial concern that these individuals will seek to use discovery\nmaterials to support their civil cases and future public statements. It is therefore vital that the\ngovernment’s potential witnesses and their counsel be subject to the same restrictions as Ms.\n\nApp.o4o\nDOJ-OGR-oool9499\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019503.jpg": "CaGeide2QoeRB MOB 3o o4TMe Deter? 29-o2 OF RES O7827 289 Aagef J 2b l3\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n~- eee eee eet LLL\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ° DROW ERT VE ONDER\n-v.- : CO\n2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\n- eee eee eee LLL\nALISON J.

Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 2\nThe defendant’s demand that she and her counsel be permited to name any individuals who have\never publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any “public\nfora,” and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,\nand should be denied.\n\nAs an initial mater, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and\nvictim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly\nin the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of victim\nidentities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, l8 U.S.C. §\n377l, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded,\namong other rights, “[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused,” in addition to “[t]he\nright to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy.” Id. §§\n(a)(l), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has a strong interest in protecting\nthe identities of . . . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes.”\nUnited States v. Paris, 2oo7 WL l484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May l8, 2oo7).\n\nMoreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely\nacknouledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley,\nl3 Cr. 48 (AJN), 2ol6 WL 9o225o8, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6) (“Because Corley’s minor\nvictims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests are minimal,\nthe Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from\nlearning the surnames of the minor victims.”); United States v. Kelly, o7 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2oo8 WL\n5o6882o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July lo, 2oo8) (“Given the potentially explicit nature of the government\nwitnesses’ expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity\nto protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties\n[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity\nor any identifying information of the government’s witnesses.”). It is similarly routine in this\nDistrict for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as “Victim-l” or\n‘“‘Witness-l’’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly.\n\nThe Government’s proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally\nrequiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or\nfiling while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial.\nIndeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation and preparation for trial, the Government’s\nproposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators,\nshould not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with\nprospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing\nor disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order { 5. The terms of the\nGovernment’s proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by\nname in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of\na pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be\nprohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time\nor deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense\nparagraphs 7, 9, and l7 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and l6).\n\nApp.o57\nDOJ-OGR-oool95l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019520.jpg": "Odsedl ADA SBos ATT tide WHE 262 F iB 628/PAg Kayei6l 257\n\nThe Honorable Alison J. Nathan\n\nJuly 28, 2o2o\n\nPage 6\nGovernment.’ The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where\nsuch a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective\norder to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so\nthat the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s atempt to refuse\nto agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use\nof its oun materials should be rejected.\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government’s use of materials it has gathered through its\ninvestigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary\ndisclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of\nJustice and the U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case,\nconsistent with the Government’s customary practice, and as the Government has informed\ndefense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel\nwith the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed,\nconsistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a\nwitness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more\ncommonly shou a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the\nGovernment rarely if ever shous a_ witness material she has not already seen, does not have\npersonal knouledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically\nspeaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not\nlikely to occur.\n\nNevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to\ndemand restrictions on the Government’s use of its oun materials. To the contrary, as noted above,\nmany of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes\nno suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as\na whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would\nconflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations\nunder various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of\nInformation Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 34o U.S. 462 (l95l), that cannot be bargained away through\na protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has\nreceived both FOJA and Jouhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which\nthe Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully\nsubmits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a\nprotective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites\nno authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue.\n\nBy contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the\nGovernment, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government’s use, or third parties’ use,\n\n* Specifically, the defendant’s proposed protective order differs from the Government’s in that\nit adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential\nwitnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government\nparagraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.\nApp.o6l\nDOJ-OGR-oool952o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019522.jpg": "CaSeide2QoeROOB 2o o4IN ce Detlnien? 2-o2 OF RES O7928/289 Paget l 2b l2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\neee ee ee eR\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA ORO OER\n—-  - ;\n: 2o Cr. 33o (AUN)\nGHISLAINE MAXWELL, :\nDefendant. :\nSo LL Lg\nALISON J.

OPINION & ORDER\nALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:\nBoth parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on\nmost of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public\nrecord to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their\ncounsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial\nin this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the\nfollouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order.\nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), “[a]t any time the court may, for\ngood cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.”\nThe good cause standard “requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of\nthe protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s interest in the\ninformation.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party\nseeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing good cause. Cf Gambale v. Deutsche\nBank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nl\nApp.o87\nDOJ-OGR-oool9546\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019547.jpg": "Cased ADAH SBos AT en dc WHE 362 FiRABOZ2o/Pageiyef2l ab3\n\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\ntheir identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the protective order should\n“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or\ndisseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery\nmaterials”); see also United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at\n*ll(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for\nindividuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because\nthey have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements\nare equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a\nfar different mater than simply making a public statement “relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no\nrelevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy\ninterest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks\nundermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by\nlaw. In contrast, the Government’s proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allous the\nDefense to “referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant . . . to Potential\nDefense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the\ndefense case at trial.” Dkt.

There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here.\n\nSecond, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective\norder that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal\ndiscovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allou the\ndefendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those\nthat are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third\nparties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly\nconcerned about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her\ncounsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly\ninappropriate for defense counsel to be permited to sift through the criminal case discovery and\ncherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend\nagainst accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of previously-\nsealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time.\nAnd yet that is what the defendant proposes.\n\nThird, the specific documents at issue pertain to ex parte applications made as part of an\nongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain\nunder seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those\nmaters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Leter, remain sealed.? As\nthe U.S. Atorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the\ninvestigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of\nJeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, houever, have not\nbeen made public.* Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were\nproduced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument that such materials are not\n“confidential” would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also\nmisapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.> See,\n> The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (l) as noted above, the permission from Court-l\nto provide the April 2ol9 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions\nthe Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the\nrecord relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The\ndefendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without\nany application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect.\n\n* To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the\nnature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental\nleter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an\nexplanation.\n> Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are\nimproperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-l and\nCourt-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials.

The requested redactions and\nsealing would thus be necessary to ensure compliance with those sealing orders and is justified\nbased upon them.” Cf Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 44l U.S. 2ll, 2l8 n.9 (l979)\n(“Since the l7th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records of\nsuch proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury secrecy ... is an\nintegral part of our criminal justice system.”).\n\nAssuming without agreeing that these materials constitute “judicial documents” within the\nmeaning of First Amendment right-of-access jurisprudence, such a determination would not be\ndispositive. The First Amendment presumptive right of access applies to civil and criminal\nproceedings and “protects the public against the government’s arbitrary interference with access\nto important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684\nF.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2ol2) (internal quotation marks omited). The Circuit has applied two\ndifferent approaches when deciding whether the First Amendment right applies to particular\nmaterial. The “experience-and-logic” approach asks “both whether the documents have\nhistorically been open to the press and general public and whether public access plays a significant\npositive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo, l2o (2d Cir. 2oo6) (internal quotation marks omited). The second\napproach—employed when analyzing judicial documents related to judicial proceedings covered\nby the First Amendment right—asks whether the documents at issue “‘are derived from or are a\nnecessary corollary of the capacity to atend the relevant proceedings.” /d. (internal quotation\nmarks and alteration omited).\n\nEven when it applies, the First Amendment right creates only a presumptive right of access,\nand the “presumption is rebutable upon demonstration that suppression ‘is essential to preserve\nhigher values and is narrouly tailored to serve that interest.’” Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino,\n38o F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2oo4) (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside\nCnty., 464 U.S. 5ol, 5lo(l984)) (internal citation omited). “What offends the First Amendment\nis the atempt to [exclude the public] without sufficient justification,” NYCTA, 684 F.3d at 296,\nnot the simple act of exclusion itself. Thus, the presumptive right of access may be overcome by\n“specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the\nsealing order is narrouly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at l24.\n\n* The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in a certain order issued\nin April 2ol9, namely that the order itself may be provided to the recipient of a subpoena, and,\npursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery\nobligations, that the entirety of the relevant filings may be provided to the defendant as discovery\nin this criminal case.\nApp.o96\nDOJ-OGR-oool9555\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019558.jpg": "Case PAGEL ONBSOUAIEht DoOcORBAT-AL o Fue ad S7o2)2o9 eR Agecl iS\nUSDC SDNY\nDOCUMENT\nELECTRONICALLY FILED\nDOC #;\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DATE FILED: _ 9/2/2o\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\nUnited States of America,\n—VvV—\n2o-CR-33o (AJN)\nGhislaine Maxwell,\nMEMORANDUM\nDefendant.

The Court’s decision to adopt the\nGovernment’s proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine whether the\ndocuments in question are “judicial documents;” (i) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to\nthe materials; and (iti) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at ll9-2o. “Such\ncountervailing factors include but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’\nand ‘the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.’” /d. at l2o (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44,\nlo48 (2d Cir.l995) (“Amodeo IP’)). The Government’s proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds\nthat the defendant’s leter motion is “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial\nprocess,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United\nStates v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d l4l, l45 (2d Cir. l995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law\npresumption of access ataches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations\nagainst the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including,\nmost notably, the threat that public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury\ninvestigation—favor the Government’s proposed narrouly tailored redactions.\nIn light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to\nthe Defendant’s reply leter, dated August 24, 2o2o and the Defendant’s August 24, 2o2o leter addressing her\nproposed redactions to the Defendant’s August l7, 2o2o leter motion.

See, e.g., United States v. Caparros, 8oo F.2d 23,\n24 (2d Cir. l986) (“We hold that this collateral protec-\ntive order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § l29l\n.... ); United States v.

Because “a litigant\ndoes not have an unrestrained right to disseminate in-\nformation that has been obtained through pretrial dis-\ncovery,” such protective orders do not amount to an im-\npermissible prior restraint under the First Amend-\nment. Caparros, 8oo F.2d at 25. Even where a litigant\nraises a colorable argument that a protective order vi-\nolates a litigant’s right to release documents outside of\ncriminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right can\nawait final judgment on the underlying charges” be-\ncause the “purported right at issue is not related to any\nright not to stand trial.” Jd. at 26.\nB.

Thus, appellate jurisdiction in those\ncases was founded on the principle that when interve-\nnors seek access to sealed records, “orders denying ac-\ncess are final as to the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyra-\nmid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo, ll7 (2d Cir. 2oo6)\n(emphasis added). Once the courts in those cases de-\nnied the intervenors’ motions to modify protective or-\nders, there was nothing left for those intervenors to Lit-\nigate. Here, by contrast, Judge Nathan’s Order did not\nend the entire litigation as to Maxwell. To the con-\ntrary, Maxwell is scheduled to file pretrial motions in\nDecember 2o2o and to proceed to trial in July 2o2l.\nWhen considering interlocutory appeals from rul-\nings on protective orders governing a criminal defend-\nant’s use of discovery materials, by contrast, this Court\nhas concluded it lacks jurisdiction. See Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 24; Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798. Maxwell cites no\ncase in which this Court has found jurisdiction over an\ninterlocutory appeal of an order regulating the use of\nmaterials a criminal defendant received during litiga-\ntion, and her efforts to distinguish Pappas and Capar-\nros fall short. Pappas concluded that where a protec-\ntive order “prohibits . .. <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information [a de-\nfendant] acquired from the Government prior to the\nlitigation, the order is not a typical protective order\nregulating discovery documents and should be appeal-\nable because of the breadth of its restraint.” Pappas,\n94 F.3d at 798 (emphasis added). But that is not the\nDOJ-OGR-oool9627\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019628.jpg": "Case 2o-3o6l, Document 82, lo/o2/2o2o, 2944267, Page2l of 37\nl5\n\ntype of protective order at issue here. To the contrary,\nthe Protective Order in this case expressly provides\nthat its provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-\ning <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any information, with the exception\nof victim or witness identifying information, that is\npublicly available or obtained by the Defendant or her\nDefense Counsel form a source other than the Govern-\nment.” (A. 84-85). Instead, the Protective Order “im-\nposed restrictions on the parties’ <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of materi-\nals exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,\nlike the similar provision in the Pappas protective or-\nder, is therefore “not subject to appeal” prior to entry\nof final judgment. Pappas, 94 F.3d at 798.\n\nCaparros is similarly analogous. That case declined\nto find jurisdiction over a similar order for several rea-\nsons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue\nis not related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 8oo\nF.2d at 26. The Court also concluded that the protec-\ntive order in that case would be reviewable on appeal\nafter final judgment and emphasized that the defend-\nant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order\nis not immediately reviewed.” Jd. So too here. Maxwell\nhas not articulated any serious injury she will suffer if\nthis Court dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical\nharm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising\nfrom the unsealing of filings in a civil case. Should any\nprejudicial publicity arise, though, Maxwell will be\nfully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry\nof final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 2l5, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2olo)\n(evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether public-\nity biased the venire); United States v.

To the extent Maxwell still\nwishes to use materials she obtained through criminal\ndiscovery for other purposes after entry of final judg-\nment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization\nfrom this Court to do so then.

Even if Maxwell were correct that the way\nin which the Government obtained the materials was\nimproper—and she is not—that fact would have no\nbearing on the analysis of whether materials in certain\ncivil cases should be unsealed. Maxwell cites not a sin-\ngle case to support the conclusion that her desire to\nprevent the Government from raising an inevitable\ndiscovery argument in suppression litigation should\nimpact the unsealing analysis in a civil case.

Accordingly, Judge Nathan did\nnot abuse her discretion when concluding that Max-\nwell “furnishe[d] no substantive explanation regarding\nthe relevance of the Documents to decisions to be made\nin those maters, let alone any explanation of why\nmodifying the protective order in order to allou such\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication\nof those maters.” (A. lol).\n\nIn pressing for a different result here, Maxwell ar-\ngues that “if the deposition material is unsealed, it\nmay foreclose” any of her arguments to Judge Nathan\nabout the perjury counts or other remedies available\nto Maxwell based on the Government’s alleged circum-\nvention of Second Circuit law.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool97o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019703.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document l-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll673, Pagelo of l9\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v.

First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3-cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9725\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019726.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 3-2, ol/l2/2o2l, 3oll69l, Pagell of 2o\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool9754\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019755.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2o-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65965, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o7/29/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool978o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019781.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 2l-2, o3/24/2o2l, 3o65978, Pagell of 25\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses tn this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\n\nDOJ-OGR-oool98o4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00019805.jpg": "Case 2l-58, Document 23, o3/29/2o2l, 3o65988, Pagelo of 24\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\nentered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge\nAlison J.

(Comey, Maurene)\n(Entered: l2/o2/2o2o)\n\nl2/o3/2o2o 8l | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On November 25, 2o2o, counsel for Defendant\nGhislaine Maxwell filed a leter request seeking an in camera conference for the\npresentation of a renewed motion for release on bail and a request to seal the\nNovember 25, 2o2o leter in its entirety. The Court required justification for the\nsealing request. On November 3o, 2o2o, the defense counsel filed a second leter no\nlonger fully pressing the unsupported request to file the leter entirely under seal and\ninstead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 3oth leters.\nThe Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 8o.\nAfter due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,\nwhich are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the\nthree-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of\nOnondaga, 435 F.3d llo (2d Cir. 2oo6). Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access. Id. at ll92o. \"Such countervailing\nfactors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or\njudicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.\" Id. at l2o\n(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 7l F.3d lo44, lo5o (2d Cir. l995) (\"Amodeo II\")).\nThe proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's\nleter motions are \"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in\nthe judicial process,\" thereby qualifying as a \"judicial document\" for purposes of the\nfirst element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo (\"Amodeo I\"), 44 F.3d l4l,\nl45 (2d Cir. l995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt. No. 8o, the Court DENIES the\nDefendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy\ninterests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2o2o leter, the Court will permit\nthe Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrouly tailored\nredactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly\nprepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for\nrelease on bail. SO ORDERED.

In\nl5 other words, when the account was opened, there were\nl6 disclosures made about the defendant's finances. In those\nl7 records, which are dated January 2ol9, the defendant's annual\nl8 income is listed as ranging from $2oo,ooo to approximately half\nl9 a million dollars. And both her net worth and liquid assets\n2o are listed as ranging from $lo million and above.\n2l Second, as we noted in our reply, the defendant is the\n22 grantor of a trust account in the same SWIFT bank with assets\n23 of more than $4 million as of last month. Bank documents\n24 reflect that the trust has three trustees, one of whom has the\n25 authority to act independently. One of those trustees is a\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o3oo\nDOJ-OGR-oool9956\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020035.jpg": "Caesast:2o-S8oo8RoHAENt ISSCUMENT/OD2 FileebBa3A/ Page age afl26io45\nB. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the\nPast Five Years\n\nThe government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and\ncompleteness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.\n(Dkt. 22 at ll-l2: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of\nMs. Maxwell's finances and the resources available to her” and therefore had no way “to set\nfinancial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).\n\nTo address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel\nretained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct\nan analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins\naccountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,\ntax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by\nMs. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.\nMaxwell, and the source of those assets from 2ol5-2o2o. This analysis, which is based in\nsubstantial part on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved a\nsignificant amount of work and has taken substantial time to complete. It was not possible\nto perform this analysis in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail\nhearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained follouing her arrest.\n\nThe Macalvins report was also reviewed by i. a Certified Fraud Examiner\nand a former IRS Special Agent with over 4o years of experience in complex financial fraud\ninvestigations. As a Special Agent, f | investigated numerous financial fraud and criminal\ntax cases, including several in this District. Dl reviewed the Macalvins report and the\nunderlying documents and determined that it presents a complete and accurate summary of the\nassets held by Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in\n\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2oo35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020308.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tra S3osaTentDGcWAiW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, 57Age Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges and a\nsubstantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three months remaining.\nGovernment Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable\n\nThe government implies that the assumptions underlying the July l2 trial date are\nirrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that its investigation was “ongoing.” But\n“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to enlarge the originally\ncharged conspiracy from four to eleven years and adding two new distinct charges based on\ndistinct alleged conduct that purportedly took place outside the time period of the original\ncharges. This is not a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for\nexample, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added a\nbrand new case on top of the existing case. This is a significant expansion of the case against\nMs. Maxwell that requires considerable time for the defense to investigate and prepare. Indeed,\nby its oun admission, the government needed more than two months after its January 2o2o\ninterview of Accuser-4 to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second superseding\nindictment. Yet, the government confidently contends that the defense will not need any\nadditional time to prepare to defend against this revised prosecution. The government’s double-\nstandard approach is simply wrong. The defense is entitled to conduct a meaningful defense\ninvestigation and must have adequate time to do so.\n\nThe government’s recent production of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses\nunderscores the significant amount of time that the defense will need to investigate. On April l3,\n2o2l, in a highly unusual, if not unprecedented <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, the government produced over 2o,ooo\npages of interview notes, reports and other materials related to 226 separate witnesses whom the\ngovernment does not intend to call as witnesses at trial. Ms. Maxwell has not yet received these\n\n2\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020309.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tra S3osaTentDGcWAerW/ 2o2l , RiNRDO3B, 57Age Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

Although defense counsel have not yet been able to fully review the\nmaterials, which are voluminous, it is apparent that the witness interviews contain exculpatory or\notherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the defense has an obligation to\ninvestigate. A number of these witnesses may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense\ncounsel were to atempt to contact and interview only a small number of these witnesses and\nconduct any necessary follou-up investigation, that would still take a significant amount of time\nto complete. Thus, while we appreciate receiving these materials, the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> has not\ndecreased the amount of time the defense will need to investigate; indeed, it has increased it.\n\nIt is also disingenuous for the government to argue that because it previously provided\ndiscovery regarding the new charges no additional time is required to prepare the defense of the\nnew indictment. When the parties were originally negotiating a discovery schedule for the\noriginal indictment, the government represented that it would be providing, in an abundance of\ncaution, a significant amount of discovery from Epstein’s seized electronic devices that\ncontained information that it was not relying on in Ms. Maxwell’s case. The government\nreiterated this point in its November 6, 2o2o leter to the Court requesting additional time to\nfinish producing discovery. (See Dkt. 69 at 4 (“|OJf the approximately l.2 million documents,\nonly a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation that led the\ncharges in the current indictment.”). These devices contain over 2.4 million pages of material,\nvirtually none of which pertained to the time period of the original indictment. Nou that the\nsuperseding indictment has expanded the time period of the alleged conduct well into the 2ooos,\nthe 2.4 million pages that were not previously relevant are nou pertinent, requiring re-review and\nanalysis.!\n\n' The actual number of pages is, in fact, larger than 2.4 million. For example, the discovery from these devices\nincluded forensic Cellebrite images of several individual devices that were assigned a single Bates number.\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020311.jpg": "Cas6dse@- trai S3osaTen tDGcWAErW/ 2o2l , RIoRD3B, 57AgePageDof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.

A//\ncounsel have been laboring under the difficulties caused by this unprecedented circumstance.\nThe government’s challenges pale in comparison to those experienced by the defense.\nDefending quarter-century-old allegations has required investigation across this country and\naround the world. Investigating the new allegations will require the same efforts and diligence.\nIt is laughable for the government to use COVID as an excuse for its delay in superseding the\nindictment and then oppose any continuance for the defense. Defense preparation is not immune\nto the impact of the pandemic.\nA Trial Continuance is Necessary\n\nWhile the government’s offer to provide discovery highlights and its representation that it\nwill streamline its case to primarily focus on the four accusers are helpful, these gestures do not\neliminate the need for a continuance. As set forth above, the government’s hyperbolic claim that\nit can “ensure that the defense will be fully prepared to proceed to trial on July l2, 2o2l” (Govt\nItr at 4-5) ignores the reality that time is needed to:\n\n= supplement pending pretrial motions;\n\n* critically review voluminous discovery produced in November 2o2o that the\ngovernment represented was not relevant to the case against Ms. Maxwell;\n\n= re-review discovery for the new time period and charges;\n\n= commence new investigations based on the new charges and the government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of 35oo material for non-testifying witnesses; and\n\n« refocus trial preparation and strategy.\n\nThe government originally represented to the Court and counsel that this trial would last\ntwo weeks. The government nou predicts the trial will last a month. The estimates are mere\nguesses which do not factor in time-consuming COVID jury selection in a high-publicity case\nnecessitating sensitive and personal disclosures by prospective jurors or the presentation of\ndefense evidence. In the absence of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the number and identity of government trial\n\na\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3ll\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES007/DOJ-OGR-00020312.jpg": "Cas6dse@- tran S3osaTentDGcWAErW/ 2o2l , RINRDO3B, 57Abe Rage Dof 8\nLAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIA\\\n\nwitnesses, including potential FRE 4o4(b) witnesses, and trial exhibits, the government’s\nspeculation about the length of the trial is entirely one-sided and lacking in any reliable estimate\nof a defense case. The government’s April l2\" <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information and statements\nregarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.\nThe delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial\nseverely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.\n\nTo assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.\nMaxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list of trial witnesses, its\nalleged FRE 4o4(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the\nCourt and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.\n\nAt the barest minimum, we require a 9o-day continuance. In reliance on the firm trial\ndate set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July l4%, 2o2o, counsel prioritized the\nJuly l2, 2o2l trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference. Counsel\nhave other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follou the\nsummer trial of this case. These commitments make us unavailable from September through\nDecember, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,\nbefore mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one\nwhich will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to\nproperly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,\ncausing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.\n\nIn addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding\nexpert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not\nlimited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been setled. Yesterday, we met with the\n\n6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o3l2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020397.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagell of 9l\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 36 | PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be\nfolloued that shall govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o397\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020398.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document l-2, o7/o8/2o22, 33444l7, Pagel2 of 9l\nentered on the docket.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the\nGovernment's leter, the Court will request November 29, 2o2l from the Clerk's Office\nas the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office\nconsistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to\nthe jury. Houever, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury\nselection occur during the week of November l5. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in\nadvance of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be\nfully briefed no later than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial\ncommencement date of November 29. The parties shall meet and confer to propose\nadjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22.

SO ORDERED:\n(Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o | 37 |MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the\nlanguage, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language\nallouing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on\nthe public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell\nor Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential\nGovernment witnesses and their counsel from using discovery materials for any\npurpose other than preparing for the criminal trial in this action. The Government has\nproposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the follouing reasons, the\nCourt adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of\nCriminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the court may, for good cause, deny,\nrestrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief.\" The good\ncause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests, including whether\ndissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others... whether the\nimposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,\" and \"the public's\ninterest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4).\nFirst, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause\nwith regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged\nvictims and witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this\nlitigation. As a general mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific\ninterest in protecting the privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that\nsupports restricting the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging\nthat as a baseline the protective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense\ncounsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity\nof any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see\nalso United States v. Corley, No. l3—cr—48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll\n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished\nfor individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey\nEpstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all\naccusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a\ncriminal investigation or prosecution is a far different mater than simply making a\npublic statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a\nstatement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in\nthis case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be\nsafeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the\nprotections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In\ncontrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms. Maxwell to publicly\nreference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also\nallous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be\nrelevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the\ninvestigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter\nnotes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the\nprotective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the\nCourt on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential\nwitnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than\npreparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented\ndespite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal maters that had\nrelated civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other\npolicies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously\nfollou. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential\nwitnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.\nNo. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to\nexamination on the record as to what materials were provided or shoun to them by the\nGovernment. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains hou its unprecedented\nproposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing\nreasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o498\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020499.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 3-2, o7/o8/2o22, 3344434, Pagel3 of 92\nentered on the docket.

Under this test, the Court must: (l) determine\nwhether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the weight of\nthe common law presumption of access to the materials; and (i) balance competing\nconsiderations against the presumption of access.

And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of\naccess ataches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of\naccess, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most\nnotably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the letersfavor her\nproposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the\nredacted versions of the two leters by December 4, 2o2o. For the reasons outlined in\nthe Government's leter dated December 2, 2o2o, Dkt.

Under this test, the Court must: (i)\ndetermine whether the documents in question are \"judicial documents;\" (i) assess the\nweight of the common law presumption access to the materials; and (i) balance\ncompeting considerations against the presumption of access.

In an Opinion and\nOrder concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's\nmotion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential\ninformation that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the\nparties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to\njustify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.\nPyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d llo(2d Cir. 2oo6). After determining which, if\nany, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the\nOpinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the\nGovernment has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and\nthat pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 3o, 2o2o, the\nparties are ORDERED to submit a joint leter indicating whether they propose any\nredactions and the justification for any such proposal.

(Everdell, Christian) (Entered: o4/l6/2o2l)\n\no4/l6/2o2l | 2o7 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a\nsix—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The\nGovernment filed a first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which\ncontained only small, ministerial corrections. The Sl superseding indictment included\ntwo counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in\nviolation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It\nalso included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil\ndeposition. Trial is set to begin on July l2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial\nmotions seeking to dismiss portions of the $l superseding indictment, suppress\nevidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand\njury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and\nanother related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently\npending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the\nCourt will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with\nthe Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added\nsex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies Maxwell's\nmotions to dismiss the $l superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her\nmotion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...\nConclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as\nbarred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann\nAct counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the\nindictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts\nfor lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable\n(Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three\nas multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47).\nThe Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial\n(Dkt. No. ll9). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week\nwhether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution\nagreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or\nwill disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final\nschedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,\nand Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness\nstatements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the\nindictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires\nthe parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing\nin light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submited by\nApril 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective\nproposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by April 2l, 2o2l why\nher motion to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.\nNo. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The\nCourt grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2o2l. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh\nthe interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is\nnecessary to permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in\nlight of the superseding indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in\nlimine; to permit the parties to make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to\nallou adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2o2l. In\norder to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will\nadjust the current pre-trial schedule.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his\nprior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not\ndeliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the\nDefendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new\ntrial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial\npursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the\npresentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby\nexcludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's\ndate through April 22, 2o22. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting\nthis exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and\nthe Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions\naffect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22\nleter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 65o. The\nCourt will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.\nSentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2o22. This resolves docket numbers 6l3,\n6l4, 642, 65o, and 65l.

Accordingly,\nthe Court ORDERS the follouing schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2o22 — First PSR\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; May 3l, 2o22 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2o22 — Government\nresponse due; June 9, 2o22 — Second PSR <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>; June l5, 2o22 — Defendant\nsentencing submission due; June 22, 2o22 — Government sentencing submission due;\nJune 28, 2o22 — Sentencing.

Nathan on 4/26/2o22)(bw) (Entered: o4/26/2o22)\n\no4/29/2o22 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order\n***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's\nRule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness\ntestimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the\nDefendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury\ninstructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core\nof criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any\nalleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its\nprosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the\nDefendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the\nDefendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is\nmultiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the\nDefendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the\nDefendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse\nunderage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts\nThree, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,\n2o22. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o573\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020633.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel5 of 2o8\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nthe Government's response is filed, the parties must meet and confer by phone regarding\nthis issue, and any response from the Government must contain an affirmation that the\nparties have done so.

SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge\nAlison J. Nathan on 7/3o/2o2o)(bw) (Entered: o7/3l/2o2o)\n\no7/3o/2o2o 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have\nasked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,\ntwo areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allouing her to\npublicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to\nthe media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.\nSecond, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and\ntheir counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the\ncriminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of\nthese issues. For the follouing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure l6(d)(l), \"[a]t any time the\ncourt may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other\nappropriate relief.\" The good cause standard \"requires courts to balance several interests,\nincluding whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...\nwhether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and \"the\npublic's interest in the information.\" United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 5o6, 522\n(S.D.N.Y. 2ol3). The party seeking to restrict <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> bears the burden of shouing\ngood cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d l33, l42 (2d Cir. 2oo4). First,\nthe Court finds that the Government has met its burden of shouing good cause with\nregard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and\nwitnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a\ngeneral mater, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the\nprivacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknouledging that as a baseline the\nprotective order should \"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the\ndefense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or\npotential witness referenced in the discovery materials\"); see also United States v. Corley,\nNo. l3-cr-48, 2ol6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS l94426, at *ll (S.D.N-Y. Jan. l5, 2ol6). The\nDefense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken\non the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily\nchosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.\nDeciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far\ndifferent mater than simply making a public statement \"relating to\" Ms. Maxwell or\nJeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and\n\nhtps://ecf.nysd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?2llo87ol522l896-L_l_o-l ll/ll3\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o633\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020634.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel6 of 2o8\n\n2/22/23, l:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version l.6\nhave no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant\nprivacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.\nand risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that\nis required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allou Ms.\nMaxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this\ncase. It also allous the Defense to \"referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe\nmay be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of\nthe investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial.\" Dkt. No. 33-l, 5. This\nproposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's leter notes,\nsee Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective\norder for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a\ncase-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their\ncounsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case\nare unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been\nmany high-profile criminal maters that had related civil litigation. The Government\nlabors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, the Privacy Act of l974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and\nthe U.S. Atorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court\nexpects the Government to scrupulously follou. Furthermore, the Government indicates\nthat it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses\nalready have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses\nwho do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials\nwere provided or shoun to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers\nexplains hou its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehou necessary to ensure a\nfair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed\nprotective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO\nORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.

As set forth in the Defendant's cover leter, the premise of\nthe proposed redactions is that the materials were produced in discovery and subject to\nthe protective order that has been entered in this case.

In June 2o2o, a grand jury returned a six-\ncount indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey\nEpstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around l994 to l997. The Government filed\na first (Sl) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which contained only small,\nministerial corrections.

It also included two counts of perjury\nin connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July\nl2, 2o2l. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Sl\nsuperseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully\nbriefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding\na sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of\nMaxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress\nevidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal\nexclusively with the Sl superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to\nthe newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follou, the Court denies\nMaxwell's motions to dismiss the Sl superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants\nher motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further\nexpedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its\nreasoning on the pages that follou:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by\nthe statute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment\ndelay (Dkt. No. l37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.\nl23), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike\nsurplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.\nl2l), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's\nmotion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9). The Court\nORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence\nrelated to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule l6\nmaterial and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further\nORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain\noutstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator\nstatements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity\nof victims alleged in the indictment; 4o4(b) material; and the Government's witness list.\nThe Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or\nsupplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint\nproposal to be submited by April 2l, 2o2l. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall\nsubmit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to shou cause by\nApril 2l, 2o2l why her motion to dismiss the $l superseding indictment under the Sixth\nAmendment (Dkt. No. l25) should not be denied as moot.

The Court finds that the\nends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the\nperiod from today's date through November 29, 2o2l, outweigh the interests of the public\nand the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense\nto continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;\nto permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make\nand review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allou adequate time for the parties to\nprepare for trial.

The Court concludes that Juror 5o\ntestified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior\nsexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.\nThe Court further concludes that Juror 5o harbored no bias touard the Defendant and\ncould serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under\nMcDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33\nis therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation\nreport. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy\nTrial Act, l8 U.S.C. § 3l6l(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2o22. The\nCourt finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial\ncomputations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on\nthese counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations\nset forth in the Government's January lo, 2o22 leter.

Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing\n\nIn the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct\nan evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.\n\nThe cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement\nmostly involved oral agreements where there was no writen record of the full set of terms\nreached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knouledge of\nnegotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly\nincreases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the\nterms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 9o (2d Cir. 2oo2). Thus, an\nevidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never commited to\nwriting. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive\nOPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors\npromised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the\nGovernment that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.\n\nFor the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it\nappears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her\nmotion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or\nevidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under\nthe NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any\nevidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,\nand, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o767\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020780.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel62 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l of 34\nMoreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus\nno unfairness here. See Stringer, 73o F.3d at l26. As discussed belou, the Court will require\nthe parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nIV. ‘The perjury charges are legally tenable\n\nThe Court turns next to Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from\nher answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are\nlegally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions\nwere not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are\nlegally tenable and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.\n\nThe applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\nproceeding before or ancillary to any court .. . knouingly makes any false material declaration.”\nl8 U.S.C. § l623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knouingly false and is material to the\nproceeding in which the defendant offered it.\n\nA. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge\n\nThe requirement of knouing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is\nfalse. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. l986). As a general mater, “[a] jury is\nbest equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question.” Jd.\nCourts have acknouledged a narrou exception for questions that are so fundamentally\nambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. /d. at 372, 375; see also\nUnited States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. l97o). A question is fundamentally\nambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d\nat 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a\nwitness who understood the question.\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o78o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020787.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel69 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 28 of 34\n\n(PGG), 2ol4 WL 3o579l7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2ol4) (collecting cases). The Court therefore\ndenies Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.\nVIL. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures\n\nMaxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it\nhas in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nGovernment’s witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator\nstatements, and Rule 4o4(b) material. Based on the Government’s response in briefing and\nleters the parties have since submited to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have\nbeen overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not\nentitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will\nrequire the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures.\n\nA. The Court accepts the Government’s representations that it has disclosed all\n\nBrady and Giglio Material\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963) and Giglio v.\nUnited States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain\nevidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of exculpatory evidence. Under\nGiglio, the Government has a duty to produce “not only exculpatory material, but also\ninformation that could be used to impeach a key government witness.” United States v. Coppa,\n267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool) (citing Giglio, 4o5 U.S. at l54). Asa general rule, “Brady and\nits progeny do not require immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all exculpatory and impeachment material\nupon request by a defendant.” /d. at l46. “[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in\ntime for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law\nsimply because it did not produce the evidence sooner.” /d. at l44.\n\n28\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o787\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020788.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7o of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 29 of 34\n\nMaxwell requests an order directing immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all Brady and Giglio\nmaterial and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to\ndisclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (l)\nrecords of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response\nto a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a\npersonal diary that is m the custody ofa civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the\nGovernment has issued for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation in this case.\n\nThe Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has\nreviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents\nincludes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the\nGovernment’s representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has\ncomplied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are\ncovered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the\nterms of the statute. See l8 U.S.C. § 35oo; Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. Next, the Government\nrepresents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and\nso that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third\nparty, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them.\nSee United States v. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9). Finally, Maxwell’s\nrequest for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal\nbasis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents.\n\nThe Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of Brady and\nGiglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady\nand that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no\n\n29\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o788\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020789.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel7l of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o of 34\nreason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus\nfar in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent leter to produce Giglio material six\nweeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a\nschedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively\nprepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at l44.\n\nB. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements\n\nMaxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory\nstatements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, l8 U.S.C.\n§ 35oo, “provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of\ndiscovery until that witness has testified on direct examination.” Coppa, 267 F.3d at l45. The\nstatute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of\nwitness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. “A coconspirator who testifies on\nbehalf of the government is a witness under the Act.” Jn re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d\nCir. l987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent pouer to expedite these disclosures. In any\ncase, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance\nof trial.\n\nThe Court also rejects Maxwell’s alternative request for a hearing to determine the\nadmissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admited at\ntrial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden\nto shou that the conditionally admited statements were made in furtherance of the charged\nconspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a\nmistrial. United States v. Tracy, l2 F.3d ll86, ll99 (2d Cir. l993). Although conditional\nadmissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government\n\n3o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o789\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020790.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel72 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3l of 34\nhas commited to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to\nallou Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any\nproffered co-conspirator testimony follouing the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.\n\nC. Witness list\n\nAs a general mater, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the\nidentity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 3oo (2d Cir. l975).\nIn deciding whether to order accelerated <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of a witness list, courts consider whether a\ndefendant has made a specific shouing that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is “both material to the preparation of the\ndefense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.\nBejasa, 9o4 F.2d l37, l39-l4o (2d Cir. l99o) (cleaned up).\n\nMaxwell has made a particularized shouing that the Government must produce a witness\nlist reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old\nallegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of\nthe defense. Houever, the Government’s proposed <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> schedule—which will afford\nMaxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allous Maxwell\nsignificantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this\nDistrict. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. oo-CR-9l (RWS), 2ool WL 96l77, at *9\n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2ool) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 9l F. Supp. 2d 565,\n58o (S.D.N.Y. 2ooo) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April l3, 2o2l, the\nGovernment produced over 2o,ooo pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related\nto non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the\nissues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of\ndiscovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.\n\n3l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020791.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel73 of 2o8\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 32 of 34\n\nD. Rule 4o4(b) material\n\nMaxwell’s final discovery request is for early <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of evidence the Government\nseeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 4o4(b). Under Rule 4o4(b), if the prosecutor in a\ncriminal case intends to use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a defendant, the\nprosecutor must “provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the\nprosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do so in writing before trial—or in any form\nduring trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The Government\nrepresents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 4o4(b) evidence at least 45 days in\nadvance of trial to allou Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final\npretrial conference. The Government’s proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge\nadmission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s atention any issues that require resolution\nbefore trial. “This is all that Rule 4o4(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson, No. l3-cr-378\n(AJN), 2ol3 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2ol3). The Court concludes this schedule is\ngenerally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of\ntrial is strongly encouraged.\n\nThe Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude\nthe parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account\nfor Maxwell’s specific concerns. “[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will redound to\nthe benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court.” United States v. Percevault, 49o F.2d l26, l32\n(2d Cir. l974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus\nschedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all of the above\nmaterials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o79l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020792.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 57_o2/28/2o23, 34759oo, Pagel74 of 2o8\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o7 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 33 of 34\n\nGiven the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the\nCourt encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks.\nIX. The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell’s grand jury challenge\n\nThe Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of\nthe S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.! Houever, Maxwell’s\nmotion seeking to dismiss the $l superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury\nsiting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury\ndrawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the\ncommunity, because her trial would proceed in the Manhatan Division. A grand jury siting in\nManhatan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 2l, 2o2l, Maxwell shall shou\ncause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Court DENIES Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein’s\nnon-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. l4l), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the\nstatute of limitations (Dkt. No. l43), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No.\nl37), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. l23), to dismiss the\nperjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. l35), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. l45), to\ndismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. l2l), and to expedite pretrial\ndisclosures (Dkt. No. l47). The Court GRANTS Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury counts\nfor a separate trial (Dkt. No. ll9).\n!

Instead, the $2 indictment provides a four-year time period from 2ool to\n2oo4 in which the alleged sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy occurred. Maxwell’s\nmotion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court’s April l6, 2o2l Opinion\n& Order.

The Court has ordered the Government to disclose all Jencks Act and Giglio material by\nOctober ll, 2o2l. Dkt. No. 297 at l. That date is seven weeks in advance of trial.

See United States v.\nCampo Flores, No. l5 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2ol6 WL 5946472, at *ll (S.D.N.Y. Oct. l2, 2ol6).\nSeven weeks in advance of trial is far more time than is standard in this district and no shouing\nhas been made that it will be insufficient for Maxwell to make effective use of the information in\npreparation of her defense.\n\nTo the extent Maxwell argues that the Government is in possession of prior statements\nthat are exculpatory under Brady (for example, if a witness denied Maxwell’s involvement),\nrather than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Government’s\nobligation to “disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes\nknoun to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the\npreparation of its case.” Dkt. 68 at l.

See United\nStates v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l44-46 (2d Cir. 2ool).

Yet Juror 5o did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his\nanswer to it on November 4.\n\nThese evolving answers do not reflect Juror 5o changing his story so much as an\nexplanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The\nCourt is cognizant that jurors may well assign their oun emotional connotations to terms like\n“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an atorney or judge.\nCf. United States v. Stewart, 3l7 F. Supp. 2d 432, 438 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo4) (“Would a reasonable\njuror necessarily consider an ex-girlfriend to be ‘someone close to him?””).\n\nFourth, the Defendant argues that Juror 5o’s proclaimed reluctance to disclose his sexual\nabuse is inconsistent with his post-trial conduct. Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6, lo-ll. In\nparticular, Juror 5o testified that he “[doesn’t] tell very many people” about his abuse. Hearing\nTr. at 22. Yet he conducted several interviews with international media outlets in which he\nrevealed his sexual abuse history. Further, Juror 5o posted a comment on social media to Annie\nFarmer, a witness in this case, in which he “thanked her for sharing [her] story.” /d. at 43.\nThese prominent disclosures of his sexual abuse, the Defendant argues, contradict Juror 5o’s\nstatement that he rarely disclosed that abuse.\n\nThe Court confronted Juror 5o at length about each of these purported contradictions. As\nto his interviews, the Court asked Juror 5o hou he “reconcile[d] what [he] just said” about\nnondisclosure with his high-profile <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> in media interviews. /d. at 22. Juror 5o primarily\nprovided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would\nhappen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or\nfriends would find this out,” despite the significant media atention that the case had received.\nId. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 5o added that in the\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o964\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00020965.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel39 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 653 Filed o4/ol/22 Page 22 of 4o\n\ninterviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 5o apparently understood reduced the\nchance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he\nexplained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial\noccurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not atract substantial atention.\n\nSecond, Juror 5o simultaneously acknouledged that because of his interviews, the fact\nthat he was abused “would be a knoun fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had\nmade a conscious decision in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> because, “[a]fter siting on this trial for several\nweeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.\nId.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s\nsomething that is relatively common that happened to multiple people throughout the world.”).\n\nIn short, Juror 5o’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent\nbetween November 4, 2o2l, and January 2o22. He made a conscious decision to share the fact\nof his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed\nthe questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his\ninterviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would\nnot be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not folloued the trial up to\nthat point. That explanation of partial public <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> is further consistent with the fact that in\nhis interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had\noccurred. Juror 5o’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to\nhis post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended\nto deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at lo n.4, Dkt. No. 648.\n\nThe Court also asked Juror 5o about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On\nTwiter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 5o and she said that\n\n22\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2o965\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021019.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 58_o2/28/2o23, 34759ol, Pagel93 of 22l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 657 Filed o4/29/22 Page 36 of 45\n\nIndictment. The Defendant has nevertheless failed to shou that she was substantially prejudiced\nby this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62l.\n\nWhen a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is\nnot prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l29-3o. Pretrial disclosures may put a\ndefendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5\nF.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a\ncontinuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or\nprejudiced. See Kaplan, 49o F.3d at l3o.\n\nHere, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of\nJane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The\nIndictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this\nscheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at\nvarious properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had\nlong recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at l6-l7, although she did not report\nthat Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the\nDefendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of\nsubstantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where\nshe recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2o2l, more than three weeks before trial. At\nthat point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the\nDefendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,\nNov. 23, 2o2l Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the\ndefendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed\nthe evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”).

At the outset, Juror 5o’s explanation\nfor his untruthful responses on the questionnaire only as to questions that would\nhave revealed his sexual abuse history were not credible, rendering his self-serving\nstatements that he was unbiased unreliable.

The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a Plea to Federal Charges\nNegotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September l8, 2oo7. Responding to\nVillafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkouitz suggested that Epstein plead to one federal charge\nwith a l2-month sentence, folloued by one year of supervised release with a requirement for home\ndetention and two years of state probation, with the first six months of the state sentence to be\nserved under community control. Villafafia replied, “I knou that the U.S. Atorney will not go\nbelou l8 months of prison/jail time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly\nthereafter, Villafafia emailed Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm Beach manager:\nHi all — I think that we may be near the end of our negotiations with\nMr. Epstein, and not because we have reached a resolution. As I\nmentioned yesterday, I spent about l2 hours over the weekend\ndrafting Informations, changing plea agreements, and writing\nfactual proffers. I was supposed to receive a draft agreement from\nthem yesterday, which never arrived. At that time, they were\nleaning touards pleading only to state charges and doing all of the\ntime in state custody.\nLate last night I talked to Jay Lefkouitz who asked about Epstein\npleading to two twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail\ntime being spent in home confinement pursuant to the guidelines.

As Lefkouitz\nfurther argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist\nsentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,\nLourie, and Villafafia discussed the mater in a conference call.\n\nLefkouitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omited identification of\n\nthe charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkouitz emailed Acosta:\n\nI got a call from [MJarie who said you had rejected our proposal.\n\nDoes that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit\n\nnou to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his l8 month\n\nsentence and then be sentenced to l2 month[s] community control\n\nfor that charge?

The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause\n\nThroughout that Sunday evening, Lefkouitz had numerous email exchanges with\nVillafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)\nand Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkouitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the\nfirst time, included a confidentiality term:\n\nIt is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be\ndisseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the\nevent the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to\na request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the\nGovernment agrees to provide Epstein notice before the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof this Agreement.\n\nAfter making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the\n“final” version, asking Acosta to let her knou what he thought of it.

SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7; ACOSTA MAKES FINAL EDITS, AND THE NPA IS\n\nSIGNED\n\nThe contemporaneous emails shou that Villafafia continued to update Acosta as the parties\nnegotiated the final language and that Acosta reviewed and edited the NPA. Shortly after midnight\non Monday, September 24, 2oo7, Acosta sent Villafafia “[s]mall edits” to the “final” NPA she had\nsent to him. Among his changes was language modifying provisions that appeared to require the\nState Atorney’s Office or the state court to take specific actions, such as requiring that Epstein\nenter his guilty plea by a certain date. Acosta explained in his email, “I’m not comfortable with\nrequiring the State Atorney to enter into a [joint sentencing] recommendation” or “requiring a\nState court to stick with our timeline” for entry of the guilty plea and sentencing. Accordingly,\nAcosta substituted language that required Epstein alone to make a binding sentencing\nrecommendation to the state court, and required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to enter his guilty\nplea and be sentenced by the specified dates. Acosta also instructed Villafafia to restore a reference\nto Epstein’s wish “to reach a global resolution of his state and federal criminal liabilities.” Lourie,\nwho had returned to the Department in Washington, D.C., had a phone conversation with\nLefkouitz and sent additional comments on the final draft to Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia sent\na new revision, incorporating edits from Acosta and Lourie, to Lefkouitz later that morning.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 24, 2oo7, Villafafia circulated the new “final” version of\nthe NPA to Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and other supervisors, and asked Lefkouitz to send her the\nsigned agreement. After Lefkouitz electronically transmited to Villafafia a copy of the NPA\nsigned by Epstein, she emailed her immediate supervisor and her co-counsel: “They have scanned.\nand emailed the signed agreement. It is done.”\n\nIn his transmital email, Lefkouitz asked Villafafia to “[p]lease do whatever you can to\nkeep this from becoming public.” Villafafia responded:\n\nI have forwarded your message only to Alex, Andy, and [the West\n\nPalm Beach manager].

A number of the victims raised concerns about having to\n\ntestify and/or their parents finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein.\n\nAdditionally, for some victims, learning of the Epstein investigation and possible\n\nexposure of their identities caused them emotional distress. Overall, many of the\n\nvictims were troubled about the existence of the investigation. They displayed\n\nfeelings of embarrassment and humiliation and were reluctant to talk to\n\ninvestigators. Some victims who were identified through the investigation refused\n\neven to speak to us. Our concerns about the victims’ well-being and geting to\n\nthe truth were always at the forefront of our handling of the investigation.\n\nIn addition, during the CVRA litigation, an atorney representing several victims filed a pleading to protect\nthe anonymity of his clients by preventing <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of their identities to the CVRA petitioners. See Response to\nCourt Order of July 6, 2ol5 and United States’ Notice of Partial Compliance (July 24, 2ol5). It is noteworthy that in\n2o2o, when OPR atempted to contact victims, through their counsel, for interviews or responses to writen questions\nregarding contacts with the USAO, OPR was informed that most of the victims were still deeply concerned about\nremaining anonymous. One victim described to OPR hou she became distraught when, during the USAO’s\ninvestigation, the FBI left a business card at her parents’ home and, as a result, her parents learned that she was a\nvictim of Epstein. At the time, the victim was a teenager; was “nervous, scared, and ashamed”; and did not want her\nparents to knou about the case.\n\nl45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l345\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021386.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON lD 3536o38, Page2l4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2l2 of 348\nparties.*°> The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a\nsignificant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification\nfor the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have\nitself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning\nimmigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The\npossibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal\nculpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused.\nmore careful consideration of the provision.\n\nSimilarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with litle apparent consideration\nof the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense\ninterpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of\nthe investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release\ninformation as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would\nbe violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.\nDecisions about <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information should have remained within the authority and province\nof the USAO to decide as it saw fit.\n\nThere is nothing improper about a U.S. Atorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA\nor other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given\ncase; indeed, U.S. Atorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.\nAnd Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical\ndecision to resolve the mater through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could\nnot be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, houever, was different\nfrom the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the\nusual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records shou that Acosta believed the case should be\nhandled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case\nunlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may\nwell have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing\n#o8 CEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Atorney\nGeneral John Roth commented, “I don’t knou hou it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I\njust don’t knou hou that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:\n\n[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed\n\nto do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .\n\n[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for\n\nexample, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense\n\nwhich was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and\n\nnobody else.

This is not one of\n\nthose.\nDeputy Atorney General Filip called the provision “prety weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR\nthat he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial\nexperience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for\nparticipants in such conduct.\n\nl86\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l386\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021401.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 397 3536o38, Page229 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 227 of 348\ngovernment informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through\na state plea.\nA.

In her 2ol7 declaration submited in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the\ntwo CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my\nrole was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and\nallou the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”*” She also noted that some\nvictims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would\nhave on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”\n\nIn the FBI case agent’s 2ol7 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During\ninterviews conducted from 2oo6 to 2oo8, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be\nprosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:\n\nThroughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]\n\nvictims ....

A number of the\n\nvictims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents\n\nfinding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,\n28l Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with\nnotations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The\nchart, houever, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the\nchart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or\nextent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2oo7, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous\nnotes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information\nabout the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential\nresolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.\n282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein\nprosecuted.”\n\n2ol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021405.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 33l 3536o38, Page233 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 23l of 348\nChief wanted to knou if the victims had been consulted about the deal.””°! Sloman forwarded this\nemail to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly\nafter he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]Jou can’t do that nou.” Villafafia did not recall\nSloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve\nbeen advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not\nrecall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with\nthem regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that\nwe had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek\napproval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution\nin... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and\nbecause the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the mater, Sloman “did not think that we\nhad to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no\nmemory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the\natorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the\nDepartment told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he\n“assumed that was being handled.”?”?\n\nAcosta did not recall the September 6, 2oo7 email, but told OPR that “there is no\nrequirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state\nprosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding\nvictim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the\nvictims before entering into the NPA.*™ Ultimately, Acosta acknouledged to OPR, “[C]learly,\ngiven the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had [consulted with the victims].”\n\nCEOS Chief Oosterban told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the\nCVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was\nnot “‘an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate\n29l Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterban in the email because “the was the head of CEOS and\nbecause I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s\nstatement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires\nconsultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the\npre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement\nto OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate\nthe USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent leters to victims in August 2oo6.\neee Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the\noffice, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knouledge” of the case.\n\n223 The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not\n“knou anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the\ncase. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do\nwith the [NPA] negotiations.”\n294 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order\nto... instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”\n\n2o5\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o5\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021406.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 339 3536o38, Page234 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 232 of 348\n\ndisagreement” regarding the CVRA’s requirements.””° Oosterban’s disagreement was based on\npolicy considerations, and he told OPR that “from a policy perspective,” CEOS would not “take a\nposition that you wouldn’t consult with [the victims].” Oosterban also told OPR that whether or\nnot the law required it, the victims should have been given an opportunity “to weigh in directly,”\nbut he did not fault the USAO’s motivations for failing to provide that opportunity:\n\nThe people I knou, Andy [Lourie], Jeff [Sloman], . . . were trying\n\nto do the right thing... . [T]hey weren’t acting unethically. I just\n\ndisagree with the outcome .. . but the point is they weren’t trying\n\n... to do anything improper . . . it was more of this question of . . .\n\nyou can let the victims weigh in on this, you can get their input on\n\nthis and maybe it doesn’t sway you. You still do what you’ re going\n\nto do but... it’s hard to say it was a complete, completely clean\n\nexercise of . . . prosecutorial discretion when [the USAO] didn’t\n\nreally knou what [the victims] would say.\n\nSloman told OPR, “I don’t think we had a concern about entering into the NPA at that point\nin terms of notifying victims. ... I was under the perception that once the NPA was entered into\nand [Epstein] was going to enter a guilty plea in state court that we were going to notify the\nvictims.”\n\nVII. SEPTEMBER 24, 2oo7 — JUNE 3o, 2oo8: AFTER THE NPA IS SIGNED, THE\n\nUSAO MAKES VARIOUS VICTIM NOTIFICATION DECISIONS\n\nThe contemporaneous emails make clear that once the NPA was signed, Villafafia and the\ncase agents planned to inform the victims about the resolution of the federal investigation.\nHouever, the emails also shou that the USAO was unclear about hou much information could be\ngiven to the victims in light of the NPA’s nondisclosure provision and consulted with Epstein’s\ndefense counsel regarding victim notifications.”°° As a result, although the expectation in the\nUSAO was that the victims would be informed about the NPA, the monetary damages provision,\nand the state plea, the USAO became entangled in more negotiations with the defense atorneys,\nwho strongly objected to the government’s notification plan. In addition, Villafafia and the case\nagents grew concerned that notifying the victims about the NPA monetary damages provision\nwould damage the victims’ credibility if Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to trial. In\nthe end, Acosta decided to defer to the State Atorney’s discretion whether to notify the victims\nabout the state plea, and information about the NPA and the monetary damages provision was not\nprovided to victims until after Epstein pled guilty in June 2oo8.\nana Oosterban stated that, in retrospect, “maybe I should have been more aggressive with hou . . . I dealt with\n[the USAQ].”\n\n226 The NPA nondisclosure provision stated: “The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part\nof any public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process\ncommanding the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.”\n2o6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l4o6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021442.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 366 3536o39, Pagel2 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 266 of 348\n\nobligated to amend her prior leter to victims to correct the reference to the December leter.?”°\nAccordingly, the September leter contained no information about the parties’ intent in\nimplementing l8 U.S.C. § 2255, but merely referred to the NPA language concerning Epstein’s\nwaiver of his right to contest liability under the provision. In addition, the September leter\ndescribed the appointment of a special master, the special master’s selection of an atorney to\nrepresent the victims in their l8 U.S.C. § 2255 litigation against Epstein, and Epstein’s agreement\nto pay the atorney representative’s fees arising out of such litigation. The leter also clarified that\nEpstein’s agreement to pay for atorneys’ fees did not extend to contested litigation against him.\n\nThe government also intended for the leter to comply with the court’s order concerning\nproviding victims with copies of the NPA. The initial draft included a paragraph advising the\nvictims that they could receive a copy of the NPA:\n\nIn addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make\navailable to any designated victim (and/or her atorney) a copy of\nthe actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United States, so\nlong as the victim (and/or her atorney) reviews, signs, and agrees to\nbe bound by a Protective Order entered by the Court. If [the victim]\nwould like to review the Agreement, please let me knou, and I will\nforward a copy of the Protective Order for her signature.\n\nThe government shared draft versions of the September leter with Epstein’s counsel and\nresponded to criticism of the content of the proposed leter. For example, in response to the above\nlanguage regarding the August 2l, 2oo8 court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued\nthat there was “no court order requiring the government to provide the alleged ‘victims’ with notice\nthat the [NPA] is available to them upon request and doing so is in conflict with the confidentiality\nprovisions of the [NPA].” In response, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafafia\nrevised the paragraph as follous:\n\nIn addition, there has been litigation between the United States and\ntwo other victims regarding the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the entire agreement\nbetween the United States and Mr. Epstein. [The atorney selected\nby the special master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or\nif you select another atorney to represent you, that atorney can\nreview the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].\n\nOn September l8, 2oo9, a state court judge unsealed the copy of the NPA that had been\nfiled in the state case.3””\n\nFb In the leter, Villafafia expressed frustration with defense counsels’ claim relative to the December l9, 2oo7\nleter that was included in the July 2oo8 notification leter, noting that the July 2oo8 leter had been approved by\ndefense counsel before being sent.\n377 See Susan Spencer-Wendel, “Epstein’s Secret Pact With Fed Reveals ‘Highly Unusual’ Terms,” Palm Beach\nPost, Sept. l9, 2oo9.\n24o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l442\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021462.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document SR 386 3536o39, Page32 of 2l7\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 286 of 348\n\nAcosta told OPR that there was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was\n“not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether or not victims’\nviews were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team and not something that I\nwas focused on at least at this time.” Acosta could not recall any particular concern that factored\ninto the decision not to consult with the victims before entering into the NPA, but he acknouledged\nto OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it may have been much beter if we had\n[consulted with the victims].’4°\n\nAs indicated, the contemporaneous records reflect litle about decisions made regarding\nvictim consultation prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafafia raised the issue in writing to her\nsupervisors in early September, but there is no evidence shouing whether her supervisors\naffirmatively rejected Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult with victims,\nignored the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the extended\nuncertainty as to whether Epstein would ever agree to the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes\nthat its subject interviews were conducted more than a decade after the NPA was signed, and the\npassage of time affected the recall of each individual OPR interviewed. Although Villafafia\nrecalled discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and\nMenchel contended that Villafafia’s recollection is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,\nthe timing is unclear. Sloman was on vacation before the NPA was signed, so a call with Villafafia\nabout victim notification at that point in time appears unlikely. Any discussion involving Menchel\nnecessarily occurred before August 3, 2oo7, when it was unclear whether the defense would agree\nto the government’s offer. Supervisors could well have decided that at such an early stage, there\nwas litle to discuss with victims.\n\nTo the extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not to consult\nvictims, Villafafia’s recollection suggests that the decision arose from supervisors’ concerns about\nthe confidentiality of plea negotiations and a belief that the government was not obligated to\nconsult with victims about a pre-charge disposition. That belief accurately reflected the\nDepartment’s position at the time about application of the CVRA. Importantly, OPR did not find\nevidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and\nVillafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor express concerns about victims objecting\nto the agreement if they learned of it. Because the subjects did not violate any clear and\nunambiguous standard in the CVRA by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR\nconcludes that they did not engage in professional misconduct.\n\nHouever, OPR includes the lack of consultation in its criticism of a series of government\ninteractions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government’s\ntreatment of the victims. Although the government was not obligated to consult with victims, a\nmore straightforward and open approach would have been consistent with the government’s goal\nto treat victims of crime with fairness and respect. This was particularly important in a case in\nwhich victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process.

Acosta personally involved himself by resolving the notification dispute with defense\ncounsel in his December l9, 2oo7 leter. Villafafia provided Acosta with a draft leter to state\nofficials that would have opened a dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified\nin the federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, houever, that Acosta sent the leter or any\nsimilar communication to the State Atorney’s Office or that he provided Villafafia and Sloman\nwith instructions concerning victim notification other than those contained in his December l9,\n2oo7 leter. Having inserted himself into the notification process, Acosta had a responsibility to\nensure that his expectation that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through the\nstate process.\n\nMany victims only learned of Epstein’s state court pleas when they later received a leter\nfrom the USAO informing them that those pleas had resolved the federal investigation, and some\nvictims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,\nalthough Villafafia and Sloman hastily atempted to ensure victim notification through Chief\nReiter, their effort was too litle and too late to ensure that victims had the opportunity to atend\nthe plea hearing or were given sufficient information about its significance to their oun cases.*””\nAlthough Acosta may have conferred with others about the decision to defer the responsibility for\nnotifying victims to the State Atorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.\nOPR concludes that under these unique circumstances, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta\npersonally decided to change the process initiated by his staff, and although he expected that the\nfederal victims would be notified, he did not take the necessary steps to ensure that they would be.\nAcosta could have authorized <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the plea hearing to victims, even if he did not believe\nthe CVRA required it, to ensure that the victims identified in the federal investigation were aware\nof the state court proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s\nconduct, ensuring that the victims were notified of the state plea hearing would have been\nconsistent with the Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,\nand sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize notification and coordinate communication about the\nl28 As noted, in his comments on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel strongly objected to OPR’s finding of\npoor judgment with respect to victim notification, arguing that OPR “unwarrantedly applies a standard never before\nexpected of any US Atorney,” and inappropriately criticizes Acosta for “not personally confirming that the State\nAtorney had the information needed” to notify the victims and for “not personally confirming” that Chief Reiter had\nactually notified the victims. For the reasons discussed, the issue is not whether Acosta “personally” took certain\nspecific steps but that he stopped his staff from implementing a notification plan they had devised, and instead, shifted\nresponsibility for notification to another entity while failing to consider hou or even whether that entity would be able\nto accomplish the notification that Acosta expected to happen.\n\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter soon after the state plea hearing was scheduled, and the resulting\nwindou of time for Reiter to make any notifications was short. Had the USAO coordinated with the State Atorney\nat some point in time closer to Acosta’s December l9, 2oo7 leter and decision, the USAO could have ensured that\nthe State Atorney had an appropriate notification process in place to act quickly when the hearing was scheduled and\nthat issues concerning the victims’ appearance at the hearing were appropriately considered by state authorities.\nSimilarly, if the USAO believed that Reiter should make the notifications, it could have coordinated with Reiter in the\nmonths that the mater was under review by the Department.\n\n272\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l474\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021481.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document EN 3o5 3536o39, Pagedl of 2l7\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 3o5 of 348\nand they often cannot fully reveal either the facts or the status of an investigation, even with\nvictims. The 2oo5 Guidelines advise that in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited\nin their disclosures: “Because victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government,\nand may disclose whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations\nmay be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only nonsensitive data and\npublic information.”*?\n\nVillafafia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence by informing\nvictims of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not unreasonable.\nIndeed, the case agents initially raised the impeachment issue, and after considering the problem,\nVillafafia agreed with the agents’ concerns. Villafafia raised those concerns with the USAO’s\nProfessional Responsibility Officer in October 2oo7 after the agents brought the issue to her\natention, and she ultimately raised the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom\nadvised her that those concerns were improper or unsound. OPR also considered that although\nVillafafia had sought to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was signed, her\nsupervisor, the U.S. Atorney, had decided otherwise. When authorized to inform Edwards of the\nscheduled change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that the plea\nwas part of a global resolution that would end the federal investigation, the evidence does not shou\nthat Villafafia acted for the purpose of deceiving Edwards or preventing him from atending the\nhearing. Had she sought to exclude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected not to\ninform Edwards at all, or she could have discouraged him from atending the state proceedings.\nRather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafafia told him the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought\nto strike a difficult balance of securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) atendance at the state court\nplea, while obeying her management’s directive that informing victims of the resolution of the\nfederal investigation should not be done until completion of the state plea.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR concludes that the\nevidence does not establish that Villafafia violated her obligations under FRPC 4-4.l or 4-8.4(c)\nor (d).4* Nonetheless, as discussed belou, Villafafia’s interactions with victims and victims’\natorneys without informing them of the NPA and the potential conclusion of the federal\ninvestigation contributed to the likelihood that the victims would feel that the government was\n443 2oo5 Guidelines, Art. IV, 9 B.2.c(l). As noted, some victims continued to express favorable views of Epstein\nduring interviews with the government and they, or their atorneys, could have provided information to Epstein about\nthe government’s communications. For example, within a day of Villafafia contacting a victim’s atorney about a\npotential victim notification leter, Starr complained to Acosta that the government had recently inappropriately\nprovided “oral notification of the victim notification leter” to one girl’s atorney, even though it was clear from the\ngirl’s recorded FBI interview that she “did not in any manner view herself as a victim.”\nee The case most directly on point is Smith, lo9 A.3d ll84, in which the Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed\na violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(d) based on a prosecutor’s failure to notify the victim of the\nresolution of a sex abuse case. Houever, as noted previously, in Smith, the criminal defendant had been arrested and\ncharged before entering a plea, and various specific statutes afforded victims the right to receive notices and an\nopportunity to be heard concerning “a case originating by indictment or information in a circuit court.” In this case,\nfor the reasons previously discussed, Villafafia did not have a clear and unambiguous obligation to inform the victims\nor Edwards of the NPA.\n\n279\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l48l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021509.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page79 of 2l7\nSA-333\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 333 of 348\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

The grand jury in-\nvestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-\nfer in the same agreement (A.l75), and not any poten-\ntial federal grand jury investigations in other districts.\nFurthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United\nStates” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-\nSDFL.

The Complete Inspector General’s Report, as Well as the Other Reports\nRequested Are Necessary for Michael Thomas to Prepare His Defense\n. Mr. Thomas’ requests for the aforementioned discovery is authorized and contemplated\nby the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Fed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)E, provides:\n“(E) Documents and Objects. Upon a defendant’s request, the\ngovernment must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or\nphotograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible\nobjects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these\nitems, if the item is within the government’s possession, custody,\nor control and:\n(l) the item is material to preparing the defense;\n(i) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-\nchief at trial; or\n(i) the item was obtained from or belongs to the\ndefendant.”\nRule l6(a)(l)(E)(@) entitles a defendant to documents or other items that are material to preparing\narguments in response to the prosecution's case-in-chief. See United States v. Armstrong, 5l7\nU.S. 456, 462 (l996). The key term for present purposes is \"material.\" A document is material if:\n[I]t could be used to counter the government's case or to bolster a\ndefense; information not meeting either of those criteria is not to\nbe deemed material within the meaning of the Rule merely because\nthe government may be able to use it to rebut a defense position...\nNor is it to be deemed material merely because it would have\ndissuaded the defendant from proffering easily impeached\ntestimony. U.S. v. Rigas, 258 F.Supp.2d 299 ($.D, N.Y. 2oo3)\n\nThe federal courts have consistently taken an expansive view of what the tenn “material” means .\nwhen it comes to ruling in favor of <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under Rule l6. Evidence is material if its pretrial -\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> will enable a defendant to alter significantly the quantum of proof in his favor. See\nUnited States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 895 (S.D.N.Y.l99l) and U.S. v. Giffen, 379 F.\nSupp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4) Numerous federal districts have repeatedly ruled that “evidence\nis material under Rule l6 as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o35\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022037.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l4 of 38\ninformed that there were severe staffing shortages in the SHU where the alleged crime took place\nand that these staffing shortages created a significant safety risk. (See excerpt atached as Exhibit\nBY\n\nAdditionally, Michael Thomas is charged with making false statements for signing\ncertain count slips and round sheets. Houever, what the government has deliberately failed to\nclarify is that those documents have to be approved by supervisors and are signed and/or initialed\nby other BOP employees. Ifthis is the case, why is Michael Thomas and Tova Noel the only two\n. employees charged with making false statements. Indeed, according to the government, they\nhave video shouing Mr. Thomas sleeping and surfing the internet instead of doing the rounds as\n\nrequired. Importantly, on the night in question, there is at least one BOP employee tasked with .\n. watching the surveillance cameras. Presumably, this person would have watched Mr. Thomas sit\nin his chair and sleep and then observe him present a document stating that he conducted rounds.\nIt is defendants’ burden to make a prima facie shouing that documents sought under Rule\nl6({a)(l)(E)G@) are material to preparing the defense. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. at 894. \"To\n| establish a shouing of materiality, a defendant must offer more than the conclusory allegation\nthat the requested evidence is material.\" See United States v. Ashley, 9o5 F. Supp. ll46, ll68\n(E.D.N.Y.l995) The defendant submits that he has carried this burden. Plainly, the documents\nupon which the government procured an indictment based on making a false statement have to\n\n' be reviewed, verified and signed by other BOP employees and/or supervisory personnel. |\nHouever, inexplicably none of those individuals are charged with violating the law. This issue\nstanding alone establishes the import of hou the requested disclosures will assist “the defendant _\nsignificantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.” United States v. Maniktala, 934 F.2d 25,\n28 (2d Cir.l99l) The requested reports go to the heart of Mr. Thomas’ defense. He needs to\nknou if these issues are addressed in the Inspector General’s eport or in any other reports by\nlo\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o37\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022038.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l5 of 38\ngovernment agencies because it is highly relevant to Mr. Thornas’ defense in this case.\nFurthermore, the government had Mr. Thomas sign a consent form specifically from the\nInspector General’s office. (See Exhibit C.) Thereafter, the government tumed over the results of\nthis search in the normal course of discovery production. This fact shous that the Inspector\nGeneral was investigating this incident thus all information they receive is discoverable. This\nCourt should order the production of the documents within forty-five (45) days from the entry of\nan order on this motion.\n\nB. Rule l6 and Brady-Giglio Include the Production of Documents and —\n\nReports Generated by Other Agencies\n\nThe facts, shoun above as reported in the media and secondary sources, clearly shou that\nother agencies were involved in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein’s death and the defendant’s\narrest and indictment. Thus, clearly, this Court should not permit the government to selflimit\ndiscovery. A prosecutor is not \"alloued to avoid <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of evidence by the simple expedient\nof leaving relevant evidence to repose in the hands of another agency while utilizing his access to\nit in preparing his case for trial.\" United States v. Trevino, 556 F.2d l265, l272 (5th Cir.l977);\n\nU.S. v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337 (S.D. N.Y. 2oo4)\n\nIn United States v. Bryan, 868 F.2d lo32 (9th Cir.l989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 858, llo\nS.Ct. l67, lo7 L.Ed.2d l24 (l989), after a nationwide investigation by the IRS, Bryan had been\nconvicted of, among other things, conspiracy to defraud the United States. Bryan sought\ndiscovery, under Rule l6(a)(l)(C) of items that were in the possession of the FBI. The charges\nagainst Bryan stemmed from the IRS investigation, and this difference, together with the further\nobjection that production should be limited only to documents found in the District in which the\nmater was pending, Oregon, formed the basis of the government’s objection.\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o38\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022039.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l6 of 38\n\nBryan argued, conversely, that the ‘government’ under the Rule, included not only the\nprosecutors, but also any closely connected investigative agencies. The Court dispensed with the\n‘out of District’ argument by the government, ruling that Rule l6 was not so limiting.\n\nWith respect to the issue of production of items from other closely connected agencies,\nthe Court found in favor of Bryan as far as discovery of items by such agencies. In seting forth\nthe rule, the Court said: “The prosecutor will be deemed to have knouledge of and access to\nanything im the possession, custody and control of any federal agency participating in the same\ninvestigation of the defendant.” Jd.at lo36.\n\nThe District Courts of New York have folloued Bryan, supra. In United States of\nAmerica v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 2o4 (E.D.N.Y. l999), also a corrections/police officer case,\nthe Court found that the materials were discoverable from any other agencies “allied with the\nprosecution.” Jd. at 2l, In addition, in citing to Bryan, supra, the Court stated that: “Another\nfactor in the analysis is whether or not the prosecution has access to the materials.” fd\n\nIn this mater, defendant, Thomas, has shoun that other agencies ‘allied with the\nprosecution,” have and/or are, participating with each other. The statement of Atorney General,\nWilliam Barr, confirms that a separate investigation was initiated by the Inspector General.\nAdditionally, it seems more than obvious that the internal affairs division within the BOP\nconducted a separate investigation into the events in questions. Importantly, Rule l6 focuses on\nthe preparation of the defense. Therefore, documents are material under Rule l6 and subject to\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> if they help the defense to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the government’s\ncase. Marshall, l32 F.3d at 67-68.\n\nOther Districts have also folloued Bryan. In United States v. Libby, 432 F. Supp. 8l\n(D.D.C. 2oo6), the Court was faced with a motion to compel, by defendant, I. ‘Scooter’ Libby, in\nthe Valerie Plame CIA leak case. The mater concerning Libby concerned whether he lied as to\nthe disclosures as to Plame. Libby sought documents which, as the Court pointed out, were of a\n\n: 42\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o39\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022041.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l8 of 38\nUndoubtedly, the government is going to assert that the requested documents in this\nmotion are not relevant or material and do not bear on the charges as they relate to the conduct\nthat did or did not take place on August lo, 2ol9. The documents sought are material if they will\nhelp the defense with trial preparation tasks such as evaluating the strength of the government’s\ncase, investigating possible defenses, finding additional relevant evidence, and developing\nstrategies to impeach government witnesses. See United States v. Safavian, 233 F.R.D. l2\n(D.D.C. 2oo5) It is not up to the government to define Mr. Thomas’ defenses to the indictment or\nto determine what is useful in preparing them.\nFor these reasons, this Court should include the requirement of the production of both\ninculpatory and exculpatory evidence in any order granting this motion to compel.\nAt this juncture, houever, the government has made, at best, a token objection to the\n| discovery by citing to a terse denial made at a previous court appearance.\nMr. Thomas, therefore, cannot guess what may be other objections, but this Court should\noverrule any such atestations as going against fundamental fairness.\nC. The Reports and Documents Requested Are Discoverable Under Bradv\nThis motion has articulated several rationales ypon which the defendant in this mater is\nentitled to much more information than the government is voluntarily willing to disclose. The\ngovernment’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations do not end with Rule l6. Much of the discovery sought by\nthis motion is firmly rooted within the scriptures of documents that must be disclosed under the\ndoctrine set forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963), and its progeny.\nUnder Brady, the government has an affirmative duty to produce any evidence favorable\nto the defendant that is material to cither guilt or punishment. See United States v. Bagley, 473\nU.S. 667, 674-75 (l985) (the prosecution is required “to disclose evidence favorable to the\naccused that, if suppressed, would deprive the defendant of a fair trial”). Both exculpatory\ninformation and evidence that can be used to impeach the prosecution’s witnesses are considered\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o4l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022042.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 33 Filed o4/o9/2o Page l9 of 38\n“favorable” under Brady and must be disclosed by the government. Jd. at 676-77; see also Giglio\nv. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o, l54-55 (l972); In re Sealed Case No. 99-3o96 (Brady\nObligations), l85 F.3d 887, 892 (D.C. Cir. l999). Moreover, the defense is already in possession\nof witness statements that one or both of the defendants in this indictment may have conducted\nrounds or inmate counts on August lo, 2ol9. Accordingly, there is a logical assumption that\nthere might be additional exculpatory statements contained in the Inspector General’s report or\ncertain internal reports maintained by the BOP internal affairs division or other government\nagencies that were conducting a contemporaneous investigation with FBI.\n\nThe prosecution must produce to the defense not only all favorable evidence that is\nadmissible, but also all evidence “that is likely to lead to favorable evidence that would be\nadmissible.” Safavian, 233 at l7 (quoting United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 2d ll96, ll98-\n99 (C.D,Cal, l999)). Just as with Rule l6 <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, the government must interpret its Brady\nobligations broadly. “Where doubt exists as to the usefulness of the evidence to the defendant,\nthe government must resolve all such doubts in favor of full <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>.” fd. (citing United States\nv. Paxson, 86l F.2d 73o, 737 (D.C. Cir. l988). Without question, the Brady <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nobligation is broader than Rule l6 because it requires production not just of documents, but also\nof information knoun to the government that has been documented in some fashion.\n\n. In Safavian, the court explained the materiality standard under Brady that applies to\npretrial discovery: .\n[T]he government must always produce any potentially\n\nexculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to hou\nthe withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the\nbenefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial. The\nquestion before trial is not whether the government thinks that\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the information or evidence it is considering\nwithholding might change the outcome of the trial going forward,\nbut whether the evidence is favorable and therefore must be\ndisclosed.\nl5\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o42\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022064.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 2 of 34\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nI.

Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials\n\nThe defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in\nresponse to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with\nRule l6 and its other <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations, as described belou.\n\nAt the initial pretrial conference on November ll, 2ol9, Thomas, through counsel, raised\nthe issue of an “ongoing . . . report” by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the\n“status” of the report and when it would be completed.* (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2ol9, at 3-4, 7-9).\nIn response, the Government explained that “to the extent counsel’s asking for a summary of the\nresults of the criminal investigation, obviously we’ll be turning over in discovery all of the\nunderlying results of the criminal investigation. . . . I don’t have a time frame on the [I]nspector\n[G]eneral report, but the [G]overnment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery\nmaterials in this mater, which includes the Rule l6 materials relevant to the criminal charges that\nhave been brought against the defendants.” (/d. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve,\nthe Court declined to rule at that time.\n\nOn January 29, 2o2o, Thomas and Noel each submited discovery requests to the\nGovernment. Thomas’s leter reiterated his prior request for “any and all reports, memorandums,\n\n3 The January 3o, 2o2o production was made to Noel’s counsel on January 24, 2o2o, while\nthe Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas’s counsel.\n\n* Based on conversations with atorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the\nGovernment understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of\nJeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures.\n\n4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o7l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022072.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page lo of 34\nwriten statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the\nUnited States Inspector General.” Noel’s January 29 leter sought materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating\nparticular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously\nproduced in discovery.\n\nAt the pretrial conference the follouing day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request\nfor “whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with\nrespect to the Inspector General’s report.” (Conf. Tr., Jan. 3o, 2o2o, at 6, 9). The Court directed\nThomas to file a motion formalizing his request.

As for Thomas’s request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General’s\nreport, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2ol9\npretrial conference. With respect to Noel’s requests for additional materials related to the MCC\nvideo surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the\nGovernment’s possession and currently subject to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, they had already been produced. In\naddition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel’s questions,\nincluding video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage.\n\nOn March 27, 2o2o, Thomas submited another discovery request to the Government,\nseeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and\ninformation about the Government’s charging decisions. The Government responded by leter\n\n> Thomas, through counsel, previewed that he would also likely file a motion to dismiss\nthe indictment based on “selective prosecution.” (Conf.

Applicable Law\n\nA. Brady & Giglio\n\nThe Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972); see also\nUnited States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l39-4o (2d Cir. 2ool). Evidence is “material” in this sense\nonly if “its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome ofa trial.” United States v. Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 678 (l985). “The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all\nthe evidence in the Government’s possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of\nhis defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only\nknoun to the Government.” United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 6lo, 6l9 (2d Cir. l982) (citing\nUnited States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 6o4 (2d Cir. l973)).\n\nImpeachment evidence is material only “where the witness at issue supplied the only\nevidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness’s\ncredibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution’s case.” United States v.\nPayne, 63 F.3d l2oo, l2lo (2d Cir. l995) (internal quotation marks and citations omited).\nSimilarly, “where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to\nchallenge a witness whose credibility has already been shoun to be questionable or is subject to\nextensive atack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as\ncumulative, and hence not material.” United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, ll (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit,\nin Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o74\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022075.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l3 of 34\ndemand for it. 267 F.3d at l46. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do\nnot require immediate <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of all impeachment material upon a defendant’s request. Jd. It\nfound that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence\nas well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of material it deems material as a mater of case management. Jd.

Rule l6\n\nRule l6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Government to permit the\ndefendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government’s possession,\ncustody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to\nuse them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant.\nFed. R. Crim. P. l6(a)(l)(E). An item is “material to preparing the defense” under Rule l6 “if it\ncould be used to counter the Government’s case or bolster a defense.” United States v.

The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span> Obligations\n\nAs an initial mater, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy\nits discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations.\n\nThe Government has met its Rule l6 discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations. As set forth\nabove, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among\nother things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2ol9 (despite the fact\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o75\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022076.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page l4 of 34\nthat the Indictment relates to a l4-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and\nstaffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone\nrecords; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of writen\nBureau of Prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and\nwhile not required by Rule l6, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and nou,\napproximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the\ninvestigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants\n<span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them.\n\nThe Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio\nobligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably\nexculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or\natorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the\nGovernment intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in\nadvance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant’s motion\nshould be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. l9 Cr. l23-2 (NRB), 2o2o WL l8o9293, at\n*5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2o2o) (denying a motion to compel because the government “represented\nthat it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule l6 obligations);\nUnited States v.

Applicable Law\n\nAs described above, Rule l6, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government’s\n“possession.” As a general mater, while “[a]n individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have\nknouledge of all information gathered in connection with his office’s investigation of the\ncase, .. . knouledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does\nnot in all instances warrant the imputation of knouledge to the prosecutor.” United States v.\nAvellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998) (citations omited). The imposition of such “an\nunlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor’s office\non the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government’\nthat would ‘condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.” Jd. (citation &\nquotation marks omited); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 5l4 U.S. 4l9, 437 (l995) (Government’s\ndiscovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor\nor “others acting on the government’s behalf in the case”). Thus, discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nobligations only extend “information knoun to persons who are a part of the ‘prosecution\nteam’ ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of\nthe case,” including “police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the\nprosecutor and participate in the investigation.” United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App’x 36, 38 (2d\nCir. 2ol5) (citation omited). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information\nin the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d\n\nl6\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o83\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022085.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 23 of 34\n\nMoreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an\ninvestigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 72o, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6) (“While the prosecution’s [Rule\nl6] <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knouledge\nof the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knouledge of\nthe entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned.”’); United\nStates v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d l97, 2l8 (3d Cir. 2oo5) (“[T]hat other agents in the ([Department of\nLabor (“DOL”)] participated in this investigation does not mean that the entire DOL is properly\nconsidered part of the prosecution team.”’); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 949 (2d\nCir.l993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to impute to AUSAs prosecuting that action with the\nassistance of certain FBI agents knouledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were\n“uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants’); but see United States v.

Supp. 2d 365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other\nmembers of the Department of Justice who were involved in making decisions about timing and\nprogress of the case were part of the “government” for Rule l6 purposes).\n\nThus, as the foregoing precedents recognize, the factors relevant in determining whether\nan agency or a component of an agency are part of the prosecution team, and therefore their records\nare in the “possession” of the Government include whether the agency or component: “(l)\nparticipated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the\ngrand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4)\nplayed a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to\ncourt proceedings.” Middendorf, 2ol8 WL 3956494, at *4.\n\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o85\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022086.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 24 of 34\n\nee Discussion\n\nAs described above, the Government has produced Brady, Giglio, and Rule l6 material in\nthe possession of the prosecutors and agents at the United States Atorney’s Office, the FBI, and\nthe DOJ-OIG who have worked on this investigation and prosecution. Thomas seeks materials\nthat are not in the possession of the United States Atorney’s Office or the case teams at the FBI\nand DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation.\n\nThomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the\nprosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic\ndecisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the\nMCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and writen\nrequests to the MCC’s legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any\ninternal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s suicide. Notwithstanding\nthose facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is “allied with the prosecution” and therefore the\nGovernment’s discovery and <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligations extend to materials exclusively in the\npossession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is setled law in this\nCircuit that a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or\ncontrol of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a “joint\ninvestigation” with that agency. None of the indicia of a “joint” or “allied” prosecution, as\ndiscussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors\nconsidered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did\nnot participate in the prosecution’s witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case\nto the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the\n\nl9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o86\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022087.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 25 of 34\nGovernment; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel\naccompanied the prosecution to court proceedings.\n\nMoreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into\nthe events of August 9 and lo, 2ol9 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe\nthat most if not all of the records that he seeks—such as records of other instances of BOP\nemployees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP’s investigation. There\nis simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the\npossession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case,\nregarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct\nrequired rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other\ntimes also allegedly falsified records.\n\nThe cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the\nNinth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents\nlocated in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS\ninvestigation. 868 F.2d lo32, lo35-37 (9th Cir. l989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit\nexplained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might\nhave documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule l6’s <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> requirements are cabined\nto anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the\ndefendant.” /d. at lo36 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d\n2o4, 22l (E.D.N.Y. l999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that\n“TcJourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrouly to mean the prosecutors in the\nparticular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant,\nand not the ‘government’ in general.” And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp.\n\n2o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o87\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022088.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 26 of 34\n2d l, 9 (D.D.C. 2oo6), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice\nPresident and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not\nparticipate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited\nby another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit.\n\nFinally, even if such materials had any conceivable relevance to the charges at hand (which,\nas discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the\nBOP’s records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of\ndocuments, atempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2oo5, and parsing through\natorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for atorneys for\nthe Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knous\nof no effective way to search them. It would, as the Circuit warned against in Avellino, “condemn\nthe prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis.” l36 F.3d at 255. Such a result is not\nlegally required by Rule l6, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas’s motion should be denied.\n\nD. Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to <span class=\"highlight\">Disclosure</span>\n\nThomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be\nproduced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP,\nincluding purported staffing shortages at the MCC. (Mot. 5, 9-lo). For the reasons set forth above,\nany draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will\ndiscuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports,\nto the extent they exist, are protected from <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> by the deliberative process privilege. While\nthe prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the\nGovernment understands that those atorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report\nhave not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term. As\n\n2l\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o88\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022089.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 27 of 34\nsuch, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas’s motion can be denied on that\nreason alone. Moreover, Thomas’s request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet\nexist—fails for two additional reasons.\n\nFirst, drafts of the Inspector General’s Report, which has not been completed and will\nlikely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> under the\ndeliberative process privilege, which “covers ‘documents reflecting advisory opinions,\nrecommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions\nand policies are formulated.’” Dep ’t of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass’n, 532\nU.S. l, 8 (2ool) (quoting V.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 42l U.S. l32, l5o (l975)). The\nprivilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Fernandez, 23l F.3d l24o, l246-47 (9th Cir. 2ooo) (government’s death penalty\nevaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative\nprocess privilege); In re Sealed Case, l2l F.3d 729, 737-4o (D.C. Cir. l997) (indicating that the\nprivilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284\n(S.D.N.Y. l998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). “In order for the privilege to apply,\nthe agency record at issue must be (l) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or leter; (2)\npre-decisional; and (3) deliberative.” Nat’l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d\nl5o, l55 (2d Cir. 2o2o). “Tt is well-setled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically\npre-decisional and deliberative [because] [t]hey reflect only the tentative view of their authors;\nviews that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their\nsuperiors.” Color of Change v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y.\n2ol8) (quoting Amnesty Int’l USA v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 5l8 (S.D.N.Y. 2olo)).\n\nThe Inspector General’s Report is both pre-decisional and deliberative. A full draft has not\n\nye)\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o89\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022090.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 28 of 34\nbeen completed, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public.\nIt is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those\nrecommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being\nfinalized and publicly announced. Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in\nreaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these\ndiscussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>\nof any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine\nthe DOJ-OIG’s ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to\ninmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on\nthe issues. Accordingly, Thomas’s motion should be denied for the reason that the materials\nsought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9.\n\nSecond, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector\nGeneral’s Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials\nupon which the Report is based—are subject to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>. To the extent that the forthcoming\nInspector General’s Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and\nprosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and lo,\n2ol9, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed\nto the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may “possibl[y]”\nhave generated additional witness statements and “other information” that has not been produced\nby the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides\nmere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based atorneys who are\npreparing the Inspector General’s Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution’s\nunderstanding that those atorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise\n\n23\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022091.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 29 of 34\ndiscovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector General’s\nReport is not subject to <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that “nothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks “information and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP” and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\n“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.” Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022099.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 36 Filed o6/o9/2o Page3of9\ncustody, or control and: (l) the item is material to preparing the defense; (il) the [G]overnment\nintends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (i) the item was obtained from or belongs\nto the defendant.” Fed.

Supp. 3d 786, 79o (S.D.N.Y. 2ol8) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomited). “There must be some indication that the pretrial <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of the disputed evidence\nwould enable the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.” United\nStates v. Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 26l (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3) (internal quotation marks, citation,\nand alterations omited).\n\nEvidence is “within the [G]overnment’s possession, custody, or control” if “(l) it has\nactually reviewed [the evidence], or (2) [the evidence is] in the possession, custody, or control of\na government agency so closely aligned with the prosecution so as to be considered part of the\nprosecution team.” United States v. Finnerty, 4ll F. Supp. 2d 428, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo6).\n\n“Legal ounership of the requested documents or things is not determinative, nor is actual\npossession necessary if the party has control of the items. Control has been defined to include\nthe legal right to obtain the documents requested upon demand. The term ‘control’ is broadly\nconstrued.” United States v. Stein, 488 F.

United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28,\n34 (S.D.N.Y. 2oo5).\n\nB. Brady/Giglio\n\nUnder the Supreme Court’s decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government “has a\nconstitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material\nto guilt or punishment,” and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to\n“not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key\n[GJovernment witness.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l35 (2d Cir. 2ool). “Evidence is\nmaterial within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the\nevidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Turner v.\nUnited States, l37 S. Ct. l885, l893 (2ol7) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration\nomited)); see also Coppa, 267 F.3d at l35 (“[T]he prosecutor must disclose evidence if, without\nsuch <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span>, a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome of a trial in which the\nevidence had been disclosed would have been different.”).\n\n“The prosecution’s obligation to disclose Brady material extends to any material in the\npossession of any entity that has acted as an ‘arm of the prosecutor’ in a given case.” United\nStates v.

Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol9) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomited). In determining whether the prosecution has conducted a joint investigation, courts in\nthis district look to a number of non-exhaustive factors, “including whether the other agency: (l)\nparticipated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to\nthe grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution,\n(4) played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the\nprosecution to court proceedings.” /d.

The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to\nproduce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.’\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of materials related to the Inspector\nGeneral’s investigation is DENIED.\n\nIll. |BOP Materials\n\nThomas also seeks <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP]\nregarding” Epstein’s death, and “any and all documents, reports, witness statements and\ndisciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct” similar to\nthat alleged against Thomas. Motion at 6. Houever, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the\nGovernment reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shoun that\nBOP officials “participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews,” were “involved in\npresenting the case to the grand jury,” “reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents\nwith the prosecution,” “played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy,”\n“accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings,” or in any other way played a role in the\ninvestigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 4o9 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal\nquotation marks, citation, and alteration omited). There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP\npersonnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas’ indictment. Thus, the\nCourt concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule l6 and\nBrady.\n\nTo be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing\nalone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution. “The court cannot find that\n' Because the Court denies Thomas’ motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address\nwhether the Inspector General’s report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it ls protected\nby the deliberative process privilege.

Merlino, 349 F.3d l44, l55 (3d Cir. 2oo3) (holding that\nGovernment did not violate Brady obligation in failing to turn over tapes in BOP possession\nbecause “the BOP was not part of the prosecutorial arm of the federal government as it was not\nat all involved in either the investigation or the prosecution of the defendants”); United States v.\nBatle, 264 F. Supp. 2d lo88, l2ol-o2 (N.D.

Avellino, l36 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. l998)).\n\nAccordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence in the\npossession of the BOP is DENIED.\n\nIV. Other Materials\n\nFinally, Thomas seeks <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of information that he argues will tend to shou that the\nconduct for which he is being prosecuted was: “l) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with\nknouledge and acquiescence by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies\nthat forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is nou being charged criminally,\nand; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory application of BOP policies\nby [G]overnment prosecutors.” Motion at 7.

To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its\ndatabases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked\ncabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These\nsearches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 3oo gigabytes of data\nand physical evidence.\n\nThe files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos\nof victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand dounloaded videos\nand images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,\natorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary\nevidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while\nsimultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only\na fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal\nserved only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of\nillegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> of those\nmaterials and will not permit the release of child pornography.\n\nThis systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible\nevidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not\nuncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\n\nConsistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one\nthousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is\nintertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and\nlikenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.\n\nOne of our highest priorities is combating child exploitation and bringing justice to\nvictims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.\n\nTo that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information\nregarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is\nthe determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no\nfurther <span class=\"highlight\">disclosure</span> would be appropriate or warranted.\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22l66\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023497.jpg": "interviews with any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23\nor on August 9-lo, 2ol9 relating to Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC\nemployee or independent contractor or any other person in the MCC midnight-8 AM August lo, 2ol9,\nany and all medical and EMS and hospital records from July 23 and/or August lo, 2ol9, and the future\npathology and toxicology and medical examiner's reports.
