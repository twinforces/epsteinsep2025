R. Civ. P.\n3o(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct l7 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal\nsupport, Plaintiff atempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of\nseven hours with a right to take a total of 7o hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of\nthe Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and\nspeaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent\nlimitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.\n\nThe heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied\nPlaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth Amendment.

First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is\n<span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg\n(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*\n(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former\nEpstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants\nto Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may\nhave is identical to that of each other â what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff\ngoes so far as to state that Maria Alessiâs deposition is expected to âcorroborateâ the\nobservations of her husbandâs.\n\nPlaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is âobtaining\nwitnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.â Yet, Ms.\nSjoberg did not âcorroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.â Instead, she testified that [jj\nees\nâââââââââââ Ss\nâââ$<ââ OOOO\nI\nRegardless, Plaintiff is looking in vain for more testimony of exactly the same character,\nprecisely the type of testimony the presumptive limit is intended to prevent.\n\nSimilarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe\nRecarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.\n\n* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the\nscheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less\nburdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying\naffidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour\ndeposition to accomplish the same end.\n5\nDOJ-OGR-oooo42o8", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004209.jpg": "Casask 4olg -Qn83aPARWSPasuaueneeehes FitdechemMene! pdgage & afil2\nPuting aside the admissibility of this testimony, it appears that both men were involved in the\ninvestigation of Mr. Epstein and are expected to testify about their investigation. Plaintiff's\nallegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the\ncountry. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell. Again, such duplicative\nand irrelevant deposition testimony speaks to the intended purpose of the ten-deposition limit,\nnot a reason to exceed that limit.\n\nThe same holds true for Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or\nSarah Vickers) and Jeffrey Epstein, each of whom Plaintiff anticipates will not respond to\nquestions and invoke their Fifth Amendment right. As discussed above, such invocation has no\nbearing on the issues in this mater. Moreover, it is obviously <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> and duplicative.\n\nPlaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any\ninformation from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject mater of their\nexpected testimony. Thus, it is unclear hou these individuals have information that differs from\nor would add to the other proposed deponents.

She simply fails to provide any\ninformation by which the Court can assess these factors, and thus should not be permited to\nexceed the deposition limit based on her proffer.\nTi. THE TESTIMONY SOUGHT IS IRRELEVANT TO THIS SINGLE COUNT\n\nDEFAMATION CASE\n\nThis case is a simple defamation case.

Because this Motion does not challenge the relevance of the\ngovernmentâs allegations regarding Accuser-l and Accuser-2, the inflammatory and prejudicial\nnature of those allegations alone would not provide a basis to strike them. See United States v.\nScarpa, 9l3 F.2d 993, lol3 (2d Cir. l99o) (noting that if evidence of allegation is relevant,\nallegation may not be stricken regardless of hou prejudicial it is). Houever, the governmentâs\nsuggestion that Ms. Maxwell is not prejudiced by the inclusion of false, irrelevant allegations\nthat Ms. Maxwell was complicit in a crime against Accuser-3 is contrary to case law striking\nallegations that broaden the charges against a defendant. See, e.g., United States v. Greebel, No.\nl5-cr-637 (KAM), 2ol7 WL 36lo57o, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2ol7) (âAn unsupported . . .\nallegation that Mr. Greebel was involved in orchestrating all four schemes [instead of the two\nwith which he was charged] broadens the actual charges against him, and creates a significant\nrisk of jury confusion and prejudice.â); United States v. DeFabritus, 6o5 F. Supp. l538, l547\n(S.D.N.Y. l985) (striking âamong other thingsâ language as prejudicial where it âwould lead the\njury to draw improper inferences regarding other crimes not charged in the indictmentâ).\n\nThe governmentâs allegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the âsexual abuseâ of\nAccuser-3 is both untrue and highly prejudicial. The government is simply trying to bolster a\nweak case by including irrelevant, prejudicial allegations from a third accuser that have no\nbearing on the charged crimes. The allegations regarding Accuser-3 should be stricken.\n\n8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4224", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005416.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 38o _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 23 of 54\nA.

See, e.g., United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. l984) (criticizing\nadmission of evidence about the propriety of a prosecution âfor turning the trial away from a\ndetermination of whether the elements of the offense charged had been proved beyond a\nreasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into maters far beyond the scope of legitimate\nissues in a criminal trialâ).\n\nEvidence about charging decisions made by law enforcement officials is rarely\nadmissible because such evidence typically consists of hearsay, is not relevant, and is likely to\nconfuse and mislead the jury.

Thus, if the government elicits prior consistent\nstatements from third-party witnesses, then they will be obliged to make the declarant-Accuser\navailable for recall to be subjected to cross examination concerning those statements.\n\nIn sum, the Court's rulings regarding admissibility of prior consistent statements can only\ncome at the time the government proffers them, explains the purpose for which they are offered\n(whether under subpart (l) or (ll) of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)) and clears the other evidentiary hurdles\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo549o", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005587.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 383 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI.

It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendantâand only the defendantâwho will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo5587", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00005761.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 394 _ Filed lo/29/2l Page5of9\n\nUnder the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant\nevidence is categorically inadmissible.

Thus, if the government elicits prior consistent\nstatements from third-party witnesses, then they will be obliged to make the declarant-Accuser\navailable for recall to be subjected to cross examination concerning those statements.\n\nIn sum, the Court's rulings regarding admissibility of prior consistent statements can only\ncome at the time the government proffers them, explains the purpose for which they are offered\n(whether under subpart (l) or (ll) of Rule 8ol(d)(l)(B)) and clears the other evidentiary hurdles\n\nDe\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6452", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006549.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 44o Filed ll/l2/2l Page 33 of 4o\nVictim-4 on the substance of her earlier statements to the FBI. Whether those statements translated\ninto a charging decision is irrelevant, among other reasons, because the decision relied on other\nfactors and was based on different evidence than will be presented at this trial. (See Govât Mot. at\n24-28). Even at best, it is <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> of cross-examination of the substance of Minor Victim-4âs\nstatements. See United States v. Borrero, No. l3 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2ol3 WL 6o2o773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.\nNov. l, 2ol3) (excluding evidence of charging different people for the same crime because âthe\npoint will be made and can be duly âhammered homeâ on cross-examinationâ without using the\ncharging decision, which âimplicate[s] a variety of additional considerationsâ).\n\nIn any event, introducing that charging decision would invite the jury to speculateâ\nfalselyâthat the Florida investigation generated no other inculpatory evidence against the\ndefendant. It would therefore open the door to testimony rebuting that speculation. For instance,\nthe defense proposes to call a special agent to testify that the defendant was not named in a draft\nindictment that was never presented to a Florida grand jury. (Def. Opp. at 39). On cross, the\nGovernment would be entitled to elicit inculpatory information from the Florida investigation that\nit currently is not planning to offer. In combination, an examination along these lines would create\na bizarre spectacle, largely based on discussions of hearsay and prosecutorial discretion. The Court\nshould preclude this distracting and irrelevant line of questioning. The jury should decide this case\nbased on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial, not the evidence or lack of evidence\nevaluated by prosecutors in another jurisdiction in 2oo7. As much as the defendant hopes to ask\nthe jury to evaluate the prosecutorial discretion of multiple sets of prosecutors in different\njurisdictions, it is the defendantâand only the defendantâwho will be on trial.\n\n32\nDOJ-OGR-oooo6549", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00006699.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 449 _ Filed ll/l2/2l Page6eof8\nfrom proof specific to the offense charged.â Old Chief v. United States, at l8o.

Introduction of Exhibits 25l and 288 will likely\nnecessitate Defense production of evidence surrounding the photographs including testimony\n{+ol7\n\nThere is no Government witness who claims that they ever saw or used the âTwin\nTorpedosâ allegedly seized in 2oo5.

To the extent\nthat the Government claims that they intend to establish an intimate relationship between Ms.\nMaxwell and Mr. Epstein, that fact is provable by other photographs and testimony.\n\nThe Manual contains multiple hearsay statements and reflects a lifestyle that many jurors\nmay find offensive.

The evidence\n\n2 outlined in the defense's papers, including who was interviewed\n3 and when, what documents were subpoenaed and other details of\n\n4 investigations in two different states and different time\n\n5 periods would substantially expand the scope of the trial.\n\n6 Exactly what steps investigators took is not a simple question,\n7 of course. The government would likely present a contrary\n\n8 account of events, leading to trials within trials on what law\n9 enforcement did over the course of years.

This evidence includes\n23 but is not limited to the Miami Herald article, statements from\n24 Atorney General William Barr and the like.\n25 The evidence presented by the government in this trial\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(2l2) 8o5-o22o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo7o73", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00007078.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 465 Filed ll/l5/2l Page 27 of l27 27\nLBlTMAXl\n\nl to the jury's decision nou, which is whether there is evidence\n2 of Ms. Maxwell's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as the\n\n3 government will put its case to the jury.\n\n4 Nou there is a difference between admiting a witness'\n5 prior statements for impeachment purposes, which is protected\n\n6 by the confrontation clause, and admiting prior charging\n\n7 decisions. In a case analogous to this one on this issue,\n\n8 United States v. Borrero, another district court judge held\n\n9 that a defendant could permissibly cross-examine a witness\n\nlo about their prior statement to law enforcement in which they\n\nll accused a different individual of the crime for which the\n\nl2 defendant was later charged. 2ol3 WL 6o2o773 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\nl3 That case docket is l3 CR 58.

As I have explained, the same would\n\nl8 appear to be true here.\n\nl9 Fifth piece of guidance: In contrast to what I\n2o indicated may not come in, the Court will permit relevant\n2l crossâ-examination of the government's witnesses. Defense seeks\n22 to imoeach the credibility of some witnesses by admiting those\n23 witnesses' prior statements to the government that purportedly\n24 did not implicate Ms. Maxwell.

This risk of confusing\nor misleading the jury substantially outweighs the litle permissible relevance that the opinion\nhas.\n\nThe Defense in its response does not mention the third piece of Dr. Dietzâs opinion on\nwitness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and\nsubstance abuse that âcan affect memory and recall.â Notice at ll. It is unclear to the Court\nwhy this opinion is helpful to the jury or relevant to the Defenseâs case. Indeed, it seems directly\ncontrary to the Defenseâs position at the Daubert hearing that it intends to impeach the\ncredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. lo Tr. at l56â57.\nWithout more, the Court excludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 as irrelevant, as\nneedlessly <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> with Dr. Rocchioâs opinion about substance abuse, and because it is likely\nto confuse the jury or needlessly inflame biases about individuals with mental illness.\n\nDr. Dietzâs last opinion is âdrawn nearly verbatimâ from an academic article that lists\neleven âpathways to false sexual assault allegations,â which are: lying, implied consent, false\nmemories, intoxication, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic\npersonality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and intellectual disability.\nNotice at 7-lo; Govât Br., Ex. C (âPathways Articleâ). The Government argues that this\ntestimony should be excluded because it is not based on reliable methods, it involves lay topics\nwithin the ken of the jury, and it does not fit the facts of the case. Govât Br. at l8-2l.\n\nBased on the facts currently before it, the Court will not admit this opinion. First, Dr.\nDietzâs opinion relies on a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but\nprovides no empirical basis for hou frequent any of them are. /.g., Pathways Article at 97\n\nll\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l83", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008185.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document5l6- Filed ll/2l/2l Pagel3oofl7\nlying,â âfalse memories,â âintoxication,â and âa variety of psychiatric disordersâ can lead to\nfalse accusations. Nov. lo Tr. at l54. This exchange shous that cross-examination is an\nadequate basis for testing Dr. Rocchioâs opinion and that jurors do not require an expert to\nunderstand the content of that cross-examination. Because this testimony goes to âlay maters\nwhich a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expertâs help,â the Court\nexcludes testimony on these maters. United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 9l, lol (2d Cir. 2ool)\n(quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d l227, l232 (2d Cir. l99l)).\n\nThird, Dr. Dietzâs opinion on false memories rests on the research of Dr. Loftus.\nBecause the Court will admit Dr. Loftusâs testimony on false memories, the Court will preclude\nDr. Dietzâs testimony on the same issue as needlessly <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> and causing undue delay.\n\nFourth, in the second pathway, Dr. Dietz states that implied consent can lead to false\naccusations. Notice at 7-8. Based on the offenses charged, the alleged victimsâ willingness or\nverbal consent to engage in sexual conduct is irrelevant here: Whether there was consent turns\nentirely on the alleged victimsâ ages. See Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 252-53. The Court therefore\nexcludes this opinion under Rules 4ol and 4o3 because it is not probative but risks confusing\njurors about the proper standard of guilt.\n\nIn sum, on the present record, the Court will exclude Dr. Dietzâs âpathways to false\naccusationsâ opinion.\n\nII. The testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus\n\nThe Defense also seeks to admit the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus as an expert on the\nscience of memory. The Defenseâs notice listed approximately five opinions. Notice at lâ2.\nFirst, the âcreationâ and âcharacteristics of false memories.â Second, âhou memory fades and\nweakens over time.â Third, âhou memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.â Fourth,\n\nl3\nDOJ-OGR-oooo8l85", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES003/DOJ-OGR-00008375.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document545 Filed l2/l5/2l Page2of9\nestablished and cannot be established without infringing on privilege. Finally, even if the proposed\ntestimony were relevant to some minimal extent, the Court should deny the motion under Rule 4o3\nrather than compel victimsâ counsel to testify against their oun clients. The defendantâs approach\nhere is strongly disfavored by courts because, even if not implicating privileged, forcing an\natorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-client relationship,\nespecially for a vulnerable victim like the victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI. Applicable Law\n\nFederal Rule of Evidence 4o2 provides that â[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.â\nAccordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendantâs guilt or innocence of the charges\nin the indictment should be excluded as irrelevant. Rule 4o3 further states that the Court may\nâexclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or\nmore of the follouing: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay,\nwasting time, or needlessly presenting <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> evidence.â It is generally disfavored for a party\nat a trial to call an atorney as a witness against the atorneyâs client, because doing so intrudes on\nthe atorney-client relationship. Cf, e.g., l Atây-Client Privilege in the U.S. Â§ 3:24 (2o2l)\n(âAlthough atorneys are subject to subpoena just like any other witness, courts discourage the\ngovernment from calling the atorney of a defendant, or of the target of a criminal investigation,\nbecause forcing an atorney to testify against his client comes at the direct expense of the atorney-\nclient relationship. âThe serving of a subpoena will immediately drive a chilling wedge between\nthe atorney/witness and his client.ââ); United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527 F.2d 249, 253 (2d Cir.\nl975) (holding that the defendant may not call Government counsel as a witness unless ârequired\nby a compelling and legitimate needâ); Edebali v.

In a case analogous to this one on this issue,\n\n8 United States v. Borrero, another district court judge held\n\n9 that a defendant could permissibly cross-examine a witness\n\nlo about their prior statement to law enforcement in which they\n\nll accused a different individual of the crime for which the\n\nl2 defendant was later charged. 2ol3 WL 6o2o773 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol3).\nl3 That case docket is l3 CR 58. But the court there did not\n\nl4 admit the charging decision that the early investigation had\n\nl5 ended in a nolle, because it would confuse jurors, require\n\nl6 extended factual disputes, and was, at best, <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> of the\nl7 witness's statement. As I have explained, the same would\n\nl8 appear to be true here.\n\nl9 Fifth piece of guidance: In contrast to what I\n2o indicated may not come in, the Court will permit relevant\n2l crossâ-examination of the government's witnesses. Defense seeks\n22 to imoeach the credibility of some witnesses by admiting those\n23 witnesses' prior statements to the government that purportedly\n24 did not implicate Ms. Maxwell.

Professor Mary Giannini observes that by delivering a victim impact statement in court, âthe\nvictim gains access to a forum that directly and individually acknouledges her victimhood. The\nmoment of sentencing is among the most public, formalized, and ritualistic parts of a criminal case.\nBy giving victims a clear and uninterrupted voice at this moment on par with that of defendants and\nprosecutors, a right to allocute signals both society's recognition of victimsâ suffering and their\nimportance to the criminal process.â Mary Margaret Giannini, Equal Rights for Equal Rites?: Victim\nAllocution, Defendant Allocution, and the Crime Victims Rights Act, 26 YALE L. & POLâY REV. 43l,\n452 (2oo8); Richard A. Bierschbach, Allocution and the Purposes of Victim Participation Under the\nCVRA, l9 FED. SENTâG REP. 44, 46â47 (2oo6)).\n\nThese healing effects are not unusual.

See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at l2 (Nov. 5, 2o2l). For example, in a recent murder\ntrial, the Court permited the nephew of the victim to describe his uncleâs wounds because the\nnephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> of the\nmedical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit\nemotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:\n\n[I]t's clearly a 4o3 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you\n\nhave graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well\n\nproduce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical\nfacts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off\nthe line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through\nquestions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are â it will\nhave to be stopped.\nUnited States v. Berry, No. 2o Cr. 84 (AJN), Dkt. No. l38 at l3; see also id. at l5. In that case,\nthe Government agreed that the line had to be carefully guarded. /d. at l3-l4. The transcript of\nthat ruling is atached for counselâs reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the\nGovernment to proceed carefully because the Court will not allou testimony that steps over this\n4o3 line. The Court will allou some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help\nensure that it does not.\n\nFinally, the Court concludes that this witnessâs anticipated testimony as to the sex\ntrafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Governmentâs leter points to some relevant\ndirect evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov.

I think that's borne out by the\n\n2 substance of the document. Count One only talks about Jeffrey\n3 Epstein, the first defendant. Count Two only talks about Sarah\n4 Kellen, the second defendant. I think that that makes sense\n\n5 and it wouldn't be expected that Ghislaine Maxwell or anyone\n\n6 else would be included in allegations in a complaint against\n\n7 those two.\n\n8 More broadly, I think defense counsel has already\n\n9 goten the point that he wants to make across to the jury. He\nlo has made very, very clear, repeatedly, that this witness sued\nll Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen and not Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nl2 They have nou heard that she has filed multiple court documents\nl3 that are lengthy in which the defendant's name is not\n\nl4 mentioned.

Applicable Law\n\nA. Brady & Giglio\n\nThe Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely\ndisclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (l963); Giglio v. United States, 4o5 U.S. l5o (l972); see also\nUnited States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d l32, l39-4o (2d Cir. 2ool). Evidence is âmaterialâ in this sense\nonly if âits suppression undermines confidence in the outcome ofa trial.â United States v. Bagley,\n473 U.S. 667, 678 (l985). âThe rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all\nthe evidence in the Governmentâs possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of\nhis defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only\nknoun to the Government.â United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 6lo, 6l9 (2d Cir. l982) (citing\nUnited States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 6o4 (2d Cir. l973)).\n\nImpeachment evidence is material only âwhere the witness at issue supplied the only\nevidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witnessâs\ncredibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecutionâs case.â United States v.\nPayne, 63 F.3d l2oo, l2lo (2d Cir. l995) (internal quotation marks and citations omited).\nSimilarly, âwhere the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to\nchallenge a witness whose credibility has already been shoun to be questionable or is subject to\nextensive atack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as\n<span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span>, and hence not material.â United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, ll (2d Cir. 2oll)\n(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit,\nin Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a\n\n7\nDOJ-OGR- ooo22o74", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00022091.jpg": "Case l:l9-cr-oo83o-AT Document 35 Filed o4/24/2o Page 29 of 34\ndiscovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced\nin discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG atorneys preparing the Report, the\nunderlying materials for the Report would be merely <span class=\"highlight\">cumulative</span> of information in the defendantsâ\npossession. Any analysis of those materials by the atorneys preparing the Inspector Generalâs\nReport is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule l6 and cannot constitute Brady material. See\nUnited States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d l48, l5o (4th Cir. l994) (noting generally that ânothing contained\nin [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverableâ).\n\nAt botom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,\nunpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not\nrequired by Rule l6, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.\n\nE. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material\n\nin Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim\n\nThomas seeks âinformation and statistics that shou the conduct in which the defendant is\nbeing charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOPâ and that the application of\ncriminal laws to him is âpossibl[y] discriminatory.â (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a\ndemand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only\nfor the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite\nshouing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas\nhas failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\nl. Applicable Law\n\nâA selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,\nbut an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by\nthe Constitution.â Armstrong, 5l7 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is âa demanding\n\n24\nDOJ-OGR-ooo22o9l", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES012/DOJ-OGR-00031236.jpg": "Albuquerque Tribune Online Page 6 of 28\nSanta Fe Art dealer\ne $5o,ooo American Federation of\nTeachers Washington D.C.
