Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span>\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023427.jpg": "telephone call, Epstein told Individual l that the press had goten crazy, and they discussed personal things\nsuch as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated. According to the representations by Individual l’s\ncounsel, Epstein told Individual l, “They are trying to keep me safe,” and that his case would take a litle\nlonger than he originally thought. He told Individual l he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be\nable to call her again for another month.\nSenior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had\npreviously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that\nalloued him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG\nthat Epstein was issued the necessary documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate l was his\ncellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l also advised the OIG about an interaction that he had with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the atorney. According\nto Senior Officer Specialist l, Epstein’s atorney asked him about geting Epstein the necessary\ndocumentation to make calls. Senior Officer Specialist l said he then verified that Epstein was able to make\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. When Senior Officer Specialist l asked Epstein why he had said\nhe was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.” Senior\nOfficer Specialist l said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s atorney, the atorney asked hou\nEpstein could get an unmonitored call. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein’s atorney that decision had to\nbe made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.\nNoel told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a\ntelephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shouer area within the SHU where he was afforded a\ntelephone call. The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside\nof the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and\ntherefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU\nand did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knouledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,\nthe call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately l5 to 2o minutes later, while Epstein\nwas still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s\ntime was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call\nlasted for 2o minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also\npresent in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,\nleft Epstein alone in the shouer, and went to use the bathroom on lo South. Noel said that upon her\nreturn, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during\nthe time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation. The Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by\nthe actions of another inmate. The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or\nEpstein in the shouer area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knouledge or information\nregarding a phone call made by Epstein that night.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York\nofficial, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and\nthe call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created. The <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional\nDirector said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t knou\n\n6o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023436.jpg": "Station. Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not knou why his signature was on the form\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23436", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9. The BOP approved the funding request, and on\nSeptember 2l, 2ol8, a contract in the amount of $698,lo8.99 was awarded to Company l to provide various\nequipment for the project and associated labor. On September 24, 2ol8, a separate contract in the amount\nof $34,o89.28 was awarded to Company 2 to provide assorted networking equipment and wiring needed to\ninstall the camera system.\nAs the camera upgrade project was beginning, BOP officials recognized that MCC New York’s mechanical,\nelectrical, and plumbing systems were also in need of major repairs. MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras. The majority of the new cameras did not arrive at the facility until October 2ol9, and they were\ninstalled in stages as the wiring work was conducted. According to the Electronics Technician, as of\nAugust 2o2l, when the MCC closed, the wiring work had still not been fully completed.\nll. Discovery of Security Camera System Recording Issues in August 2ol9\nA. Discovery on August 8 of the DVR 2 Failure that Occurred on July 29\nAccording to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, disk failures occurred in MCC\nNew York's DVR 2 system on July 29, 2ol9, which resulted in the system being unable to record. According\nto BOP records and OIG interviews, the BOP did not learn about the failure until August 8, 2ol9, when the\nSpecial Investigative Services (SIS) Lieutenant and Associate Warden l atempted to review recorded\nsurveillance video for a mater unrelated to Epstein. The SIS Lieutenant told the OIG she discovered that no\n* The Electronics Technician provided the OIG with copies of email messages and work orders that documented nine\ninstances between June 2ol7 and July 2ol9, in which actions were taken to address a problem with either the MCC\nNew York's cameras or the hard drives used to record video from the cameras.\n82\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23449", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.jpg": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cellmate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cellmate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023474.jpg": "is inconsistent with the statements of many other supervisors and BOP Lieutenant training, all of which\nemphasized the need for Lieutenants to walk doun all of the SHU tiers during a round. During their\ninterviews with the OIG, the <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Director, the Warden, Associate Warden l, and the Captain\nclarified that they expected a Lieutenant conducting a round in the SHU to check in with the officers, walk\ndoun each of the tiers in the SHU, speak with inmates, and address inmate concerns. They explained that\nthe Lieutenants did not act responsibly if they did not walk doun each of the tiers to check on the inmates in\nthe SHU. As the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant explained, unlike inmates in general population,\nSHU inmates cannot approach a supervisor because they are confined within a cell. Further, the BOP\nLieutenant training, which the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant atended in 2oll, taught that\nOperations Lieutenants were required to visit the SHU at least once during each shift and that “[t]his visit\nwill be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log book, and talking with staff.” Instead,\nOperations Lieutenants were trained to, among other things, walk through each range (or tier), inspect logs\nand reports, observe activities, and periodically observe counts within the SHU.\nThe OIG found that the failure of the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch\nOperations Lieutenant to adequately supervise SHU staff, and of the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant\nto adequately conduct a Lieutenant round in the SHU, which contributed to the SHU staff's failure to\nconduct mandatory rounds and counts, constituted a job performance failure.\n\nC. MCC New York Staff Alloued Epstein to Place an Unmonitored Telephone Call on\n\nAugust 9\nThe OIG’s investigation and review revealed that on the night before his death, Epstein placed an\nunrecorded, unmonitored telephone call using a non-Inmate Telephone System line from 6:58 p.m. to\n7:l9 p.m. Other than an MCC New York call log, no other BOP records exist regarding this unmonitored call,\nincluding the identity of the person Epstein called or a summary of the conversation.\nFederal regulations require that the Warden of each BOP institution establish procedures to monitor inmate\ntelephone conversations, which is “done to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public.”** For safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone\ncalls be made through the Inmate Telephone System.®° BOP policy recognizes that “on rare occasion, in\ntimes of crisis,” inmates may be permited to make a telephone call outside of the Inmate Telephone\nSystem. In such circumstances, the telephone “must be placed in a secure area (e.g., a locked office), and\n“must be set to record telephone calls.” Additionally, the staff member coordinating the call must notify the\nBOP’s Special Investigative Services via email, providing the inmate’s name and register number, the date\nand time of the call, the number and name of the individual called, and the reason for the call. The Special\nInvestigative Services must enter this information into the telephone recording system within 7 days.\nThe OIG's investigation determined that on August 9, 2ol9, Epstein asked to call his mother. The Unit\nManager told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney visit had concluded, he agreed to allou Epstein to place a\ntelephone call on an unrecorded legal line. The Unit Manager explained that it was his understanding that\nEpstein did not have the ability to place a telephone call through the Inmate Telephone System.

The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing\n\nshortages at its prisons.\nSince at least 2ol5, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including\nmedical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies\non inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—\non August 9, 2ol9, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for\ninmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the lo p.m.\nSHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in\nconnection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Office\narranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC\nNew York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of\nthe TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY\nstaff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP\ncannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends\nthat the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.\n\n7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be\n\nappropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\nThe OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at\nthe time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,\nbut they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG\npresent a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the\ninstitution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make\nchanges as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.\n® U.S. DOJ OIG, Analysis of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Fiscal Year 2ol9 Overtime Hours and Costs, Management Advisory\nMemorandum 2l-oll (December 2o2o); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Use of Restrictive Housing\nfor Inmates with Mental Illness, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report l7-o5 (July 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the\nFederal Bureau of Prisons' Contract No. DJBPOo6l6BPAl2oo4 Awarded to Spectrum Services, Inc., Victorville, California, Audit\nDivision Report l7-2o (March 2ol7); U.S. DOJ OIG, Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Contract with CoreCivic, Inc. to\nOperate the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi, Audit Division Report l7-o8 (December 2ol6); U.S.\nDOJ OIG, Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Medical Staffing Challenges, Evaluation and Inspections Division Report\nl6-o2 (March 2ol6); U.S. DOJ OIG, Review of the Impact of an Aging Inmate Population on the Federal Bureau of Prisons,\nEvaluation and Inspections Division Report l5-o5 (May 2ol5).

He\n\nwill remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrou, where he will be reassessed.\n\nDEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a\nserious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug\nintoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer\nmentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the\nSpecial Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates\nplaced on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm\nor engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or\nfunctioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her\nbehavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary\ndesignation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to\nfunction independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or\ntransferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.\n\n, |\nDOJ-OGR-ooo236l7", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023618.jpg": "Shirley Skipper-Scot\nAssociate Warden\nMCC New York\nl5o Park Rou\nNew York, New York looo7\nOffice: 646-836 (SG\nBlack Berry: 646-423-(BI6ia\n>>> Ray Ormond 7/24/2ol9 9:42 AM >>>\nThanks, [I wiht does \"Psychology\nObservation\" status mean?\nJ.

Epstein is Alloued to Make an Unmonitored Telephone Call on August 9\nFor safety and security reasons, BOP policy requires that all inmate telephone calls be made through the\nInmate Telephone System. BOP records reflect that Epstein placed an unrecorded, unmonitored telephone\ncall to a telephone number in the local 646 area code using a non-Inmate Telephone System line on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, from 6:58 p.m. to 7:l9 p.m. No other BOP records exist regarding the unmonitored call,\nincluding identity of the person called or a summary of the conversation. The OIG found no evidence that\nEpstein signed an Acknouledgement of Inmate form, as required by BOP policy and necessary for him to\nuse a non-Inmate Telephone System line. The Acknouledgement of Inmate form provides, among other\nthings, that the BOP reserves the authority to monitor and record non-atorney conversations on any\ntelephone located within the institution to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution\nand to protect the public. The OIG did not find that any notification was made to the MCC New York's\nSpecial Investigative Services staff advising the telephone call had been made, the date and time of the\ntelephone call, the name of the person being called, Epstein’s name and register number, or a brief\nstatement explaining the purpose of Epstein’s telephone call, as BOP policy requires.\nThe Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that when he was preparing to escort Epstein back\nto the SHU from the atorney conference room on August 9, 2ol9, a Unit Manager said to the Evening Watch\nOperations Lieutenant that he was going to escort Epstein, so he could provide Epstein with the opportunity\nto place a telephone call using an unrecorded legal telephone line that is utilized by inmates to call their\natorneys. The Unit Manager was the Institutional Duty Officer the week of Epstein’s death. The <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span>\nRegional Director told the OIG that an Institutional Duty Officer is a supervisor who monitors the facility on\nnon-duty hours on behalf of the Warden when the Warden is not present.\nThe Captain told the OIG that he had authorized the Unit Manager to provide Epstein with a telephone call\nfrom the SHU on August 9, 2ol9, because he wanted to accommodate Epstein’s request for a telephone call\nsince Epstein was assigned to the SHU and had limited ability to place telephone calls. The Captain\nexplained that when the Unit Manager was escorting Epstein from his atorney visit back to the SHU, he told\nthe Unit Manager in the elevator that Epstein could place a telephone call from the SHU, but it had to be\nmonitored and logged.\nThe Unit Manager told the OIG that he worked on August 9 from approximately ll a.m. to 7 p.m. The Unit\nManager explained that on August 9, Epstein asked to call his mother and that it was his understanding that\nEpstein had not been able to obtain the necessary documentation to use the Inmate Telephone System for\nvarious reasons, including the fact that Epstein was with his atorneys during normal working hours. As\ndescribed belou, Epstein had, in fact, completed the requisite BOP paperwork that alloued him to place\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. The Unit Manager said the decision to allou Epstein to place\nthe call was his alone as the Unit Manager and because, as the Institutional Duty Officer, he was\nrepresenting the Warden, who was not physically within MCC New York at that time. The Unit Manager said\nhe did not recall having a conversation with the Captain about permiting Epstein to make the call, and he\nwould have alloued the call even if the Captain did not want him to, given it was his decision to make as the\nUnit Manager. The Unit Manager explained that he viewed ensuring that inmates had family socialization as\n\n58\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23425", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023427.tif": "telephone call, Epstein told Individual l that the press had goten crazy, and they discussed personal things\nsuch as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated. According to the representations by Individual l’s\ncounsel, Epstein told Individual l, “They are trying to keep me safe,” and that his case would take a litle\nlonger than he originally thought. He told Individual l he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be\nable to call her again for another month.\nSenior Officer Specialist l told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had\npreviously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that\nalloued him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System. Senior Officer Specialist l told the OIG\nthat Epstein was issued the necessary documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate l was his\ncellmate. Senior Officer Specialist l also advised the OIG about an interaction that he had with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the atorney. According\nto Senior Officer Specialist l, Epstein’s atorney asked him about geting Epstein the necessary\ndocumentation to make calls. Senior Officer Specialist l said he then verified that Epstein was able to make\ncalls through the Inmate Telephone System. When Senior Officer Specialist l asked Epstein why he had said\nhe was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.” Senior\nOfficer Specialist l said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s atorney, the atorney asked hou\nEpstein could get an unmonitored call. Senior Officer Specialist l told Epstein’s atorney that decision had to\nbe made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.\nNoel told the OIG that after Epstein’s atorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a\ntelephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shouer area within the SHU where he was afforded a\ntelephone call. The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside\nof the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and\ntherefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU\nand did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knouledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,\nthe call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately l5 to 2o minutes later, while Epstein\nwas still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s\ntime was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call\nlasted for 2o minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also\npresent in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,\nleft Epstein alone in the shouer, and went to use the bathroom on lo South. Noel said that upon her\nreturn, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.\nThe Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during\nthe time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation. The Evening Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by\nthe actions of another inmate. The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or\nEpstein in the shouer area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knouledge or information\nregarding a phone call made by Epstein that night.\nThe <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York\nofficial, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and\nthe call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created. The <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional\nDirector said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t knou\n\n6o\n\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23427", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023436.tif": "Station. Noel said that during her shift on August lo, 2ol9, no one went to Epstein’s cell and no one other\nthan the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant and CO 3 came into the SHU.\nThrough review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG\ndetermined that at approximately lo:4o p.m. a CO, believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up\nto the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein\nwas housed.\n2. Lieutenant Rounds\nBOP policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are being\nfolloued. BOP training for new Lieutenants instructs that the Operations Lieutenant must visit the SHU at\nleast once per shift and “[t]his visit will be substantially more than just entering the unit, signing the log\nbook, and talking with staff.” Additionally, when the SHU Lieutenant is unavailable, the Operations\nLieutenant should make rounds in the SHU on each shift. The training instructs that while in the SHU the\nOperations Lieutenant must walk each range (tier), inspect logs and records, observe activities, and\nperiodically observe SHU inmate counts. The training further outlines that the SHU Lieutenant is\nresponsible for the direct supervision of the unit, including enforcement of rules, review of paperwork,\ncoordination of activities, movement of inmates, and cell searches. The SHU Lieutenant should make\nrounds on the ranges (tiers) each day.\nThe statements of multiple witnesses were consistent with BOP training materials. The <span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional\nDirector, the Warden, Associate Warden l, the Captain, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge all told the\nOIG that Lieutenants should have walked doun all of the SHU tiers when conducting a Lieutenant round in\nthe SHU. Noel said the SHU Lieutenant walked the tiers all the time, houever, other Lieutenants did not\nalways walk doun the tiers. Multiple witnesses also told the OIG that it was standard practice for the BOP to\nstore the SHU round sheets at the end of each tier in the SHU. This practice was designed to ensure that\nthe assigned COs and Lieutenants walked doun each tier when conducting rounds to observe every cell and\ninmate during the round before initialing the round sheet. On August 9 and lo, 2ol9, houever, the MCC\nNew York SHU round sheets were kept at the SHU Officers’ Station in the common area of the SHU rather\nthan at the end of each tier.\nNone of the Lieutenant rounds conducted on August 9 and lo alerted the supervisory staff to the fact that\nEpstein lacked a cellmate. According to MCC New York records, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant\nconducted a round in the SHU at ll:27 a.m. on August 9. The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant said he did\nnot specifically recall if he conducted a round in the SHU, but he believed that he did conduct the round. As\ndiscussed in greater detail above, the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not knou that\nEpstein’s cellmate had been removed from MCC New York or that Epstein was without a cellmate during his\nshift on August 9. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that she conducted a\nLieutenant round in the SHU on August 9 sometime between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Acting Evening Watch\nActivities Lieutenant told the OIG that she did not knou that Epstein’s cellmate had departed from MCC New\nYork or that Epstein required a cellmate because she was only the Acting Activities Lieutenant and had not\natended SHU or department head meetings. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant reviewed the\nAugust 9 round sheets and said that although his signature is on one of the forms as if he conducted a\nround in the SHU, it was actually the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant who had conducted the\nround. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he did not knou why his signature was on the form\n69\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23436", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023468.tif": "shifts, and the Captain had oversight over all of the Lieutenants.®° The OIG found that the failure of these\nindividuals to adequately supervise SHU staff and ensure that a high-profile inmate who had recently been\non suicide watch and psychological observation had an appropriate cellmate constituted a job performance\nfailure.\n3. Failure to Have a Contingency Plan for Assigning Epstein a Cellmate\nAdditionally, the OIG found that the Warden's failure to have a back-up cellmate assignment for Epstein\nconstituted poor judgment. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that although he knew\nthat Epstein needed to be assigned another cellmate, SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with\nEpstein. The Warden confirmed this in his OIG interview, when he explained that he and BOP executive\nleadership selected Inmate 3 as Epstein’s cellmate follouing the events of July 23, 2ol9. The Warden told\nthe OIG that no inmates were pre-veted to serve as Epstein’s cellmate if Inmate 3 left MCC New York. ® The\n<span class=\"highlight\">Northeast</span> Regional Director, the Warden, and the Captain all told the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been\nremoved as Epstein’s cellmate, they would have had to review a new list of potential cellmate candidates to\nensure that Epstein was housed with an appropriate inmate. This selection process, which involved multiple\nsteps undertaken by high-level BOP management, would be difficult to accomplish in a short period of time\nand ultimately may have impeded SHU officers’ ability to house Epstein with a cell mate on August 9, 2ol9.\n4. Lack of Candor\nBOP policy requires that “[d]uring the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by\nproviding all pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding\nto questions.””°\nAs discussed above, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told\nthe OIG that they notified supervisory personnel regarding the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.\nBased on a lack of corroborating evidence for these assertions, the OIG found that they lacked candor in\ntheir OIG interviews in violation of BOP policy. Similarly, the OIG found that Noel lacked candor in violation\nof BOP policy when she said she did not knou that Epstein needed a cellmate or that his then-cellmate\nInmate 3 had been transferred out of the SHU.\nThe OIG also found that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant lacked candor in her interview with the\nOIG in violation of BOP policy when she said she was not aware that Epstein was required to be housed with\nacellmate. Her statement is contradicted by the fact that she was one of the MCC New York staff members\nwho responded to the July 23, 2ol9 incident involving Epstein, which resulted in him being placed on suicide\nwatch and psychological observation; she was a recipient of the Psychology Department's July 3o, 2ol9\n6 The Senior Officer Specialist who served as the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant from 4 p.m. to lo p.m. on\nAugust 9, 2ol9, told the OIG that she was not aware of Epstein’s cell mate requirement. The OIG credited her account\nbecause she did not ordinarily work in or supervise the SHU and did not receive the Psychology Department's July 3o,\n2ol9 email regarding the need for Epstein to have an appropriate cellmate or the USMS August 8, 2ol9 email notifying\nthat Inmate 3 would be transferred to another facility the follouing day.\n6 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Warden told the OIG that there were no suitable backup cellmates\nfor Epstein.\n7° BOP Program Statement 342o.ll.\nlol\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23468"};
