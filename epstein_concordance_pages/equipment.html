Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l6\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003219.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo32l9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003220.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-oooo322o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003238.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”>° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3238\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003247.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

If our personality differences\nthreaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case\nwhom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights.\nIn the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to\nbegin preparing a revised indictment package containing your\nsuggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by\nEpstein’s atorneys... . If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”°\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span> Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003248.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3248\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003249.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3249\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003251.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was ‘“‘a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3262\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003277.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “TI don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3277\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003288.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.'°!

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo3372\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003378.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase,\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.*°? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “‘we want to get\nthe computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “‘conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo3379\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003380.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo338o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00003509.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 333 of 348\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, ““Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.’\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\n8 Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n? In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4338\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004341.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 44 of 349\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\n\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'* At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-oooo434l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004342.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 45 of 349\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”°\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n7o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed.\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4342\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004360.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 63 of 349\ndamages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA. June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-oooo436o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004369.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 72 of 349\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else.

She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.””, Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\nB. Villafana Atempts to Obtain the Computer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span> Missing from\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\n» Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n4 Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4369\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004370.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 73 of 349\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n2 In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004371.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 74 of 349\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.” After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\n\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern . . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\nm Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\nlS The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-oooo437l\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004373.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 76 of 349\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged.”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”*°\nl8 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillafafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\n2 OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n8o From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafana’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.”?’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR- oooo4384\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004399.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page lo2 of 349\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[g]ood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4399\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004410.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page ll3 of 349\nit had identified as victims.'°!

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA. Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 US.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-oooo4494\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004500.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o3 of 349\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> associated with those\ncameras had been removed.

Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.**? Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\nae l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who .. . induces . . . any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate . . .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate ... commerce .. .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain “an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45ol\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004502.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 2o5 of 349\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.7”4\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-oooo45o2\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES002/DOJ-OGR-00004631.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document 293-l Filed o5/25/2l Page 334 of 349\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Questions to Determine the Nature of Juror 5o’s Sexual Abuse and Whether Juror\n5o’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury Questionnaire Were False\nUnder the McDonough test, the Court must first determine whether Juror 5o’s responses to\nQuestions 48 and 25 were, in fact, false as reflected in his post-trial statements to the media.\nUnited States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (citing McDonough Pouer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span>,\nInc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)). It is also necessary for the Court to inquire about\nthe nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 5o experienced. Had Juror 5o disclosed in response to\nQuestion 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of\nthat abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is\nimportant for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 5o’s sexual abuse to determine hou\nsimilar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United\nStates v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2ol2) (“Courts imply bias ‘when there\nare similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’”\n(quoting United States v. Sampson, 82o F. Supp. 2d l5l, l63-64 (D. Mass. 2oll)). Accordingly,\nthe defense requests that the Court ask Juror 5o the follouing questions:\nl. The Independent and the Daily Mail reported that you said you were the victim of\nsexual abuse when you were child, correct?\n2. Did you say that?\n3.

STERNHEIAA\n\nQuestion 49, which asked “Have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual\nharassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #l at 25). Juror 5o had answered\n“No.” (/d.). Although Juror 5o initially claimed that this was an accurate response because he\ndid not consider his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 5o eventually admited that this was\nnot an accurate answer and that the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”\nbecause a stepbrother is a family member and Juror 5o’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual\nabuse to the police when Juror 5o disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, ll-\nl3).\n\nAccordingly, the record is clear that several of Juror 5o’s voir dire responses were false,\nsatisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273,\n3o3 (2d Cir. 2oo6) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must\ndemonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” (citing McDonough\nPouer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span>, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (l984)).'\n\nII. Had Juror 5o Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for\n\nCause\n\nThe Court must next consider whether the correct responses to the voir dire questions\nwould have provided Ms. Maxwell with a valid basis to challenge Juror 5o for cause. See\nStewart, 433 F.3d at 3o3. The Court must determine whether Juror 5o was capable of being an\nimpartial, unbiased juror “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before\nl Ms. Maxwell reiterates her position that it is not necessary for the false statement to be intentional or deliberate to\nsatisfy the first prong of the McDonough test. See Motion at 23-28; Reply at 9-lo. Nevertheless, the record\nestablishes that Juror 5o’s false statements were intentional. (See discussion infra). Even if the Court determines\nthat they were not, and that Af/cDonough requires an intentional false statement, Ms. Maxwell is still entitled to a\nnew trial based on Juror 5o’s bias. See Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., l64 F.3d 5ll, 5l6 (lo% Cir. l998) (“Although\nunable to prove a juror’s incorrect response to a material question was intentional, a movant may introduce evidence\ndemonstrating bias on the part of a juror who gave an incorrect but not intentionally dishonest answer during voir\ndire.”).\n\n3\nDOJ-OGR-ooolo3o9\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES004/DOJ-OGR-00010335.jpg": "Case l:2o-cr-oo33o-PAE Document653_ Filed o4/ol/22 Page l2 of 4o\nwilling to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.” Smith v.

One important means of ensuring an impartial jury is voir dire examination, which\n“expos[es] possible biases, both knoun and unknoun, on the part of potential jurors,” by\neliciting information under oath. McDonough Pouer Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,\n554 (l984).\n\nOnce a jury has returned a verdict, a motion to set aside that verdict is “disfavored” and\nthe moving party must overcome an “exacting hurdle” of proof. United States v. Ventura, No.\no9-CR-lol5 (JGK), 2ol4 WL 259655, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 2l, 2ol4); see United States v.\nTanniello, 866 F.2d 54o, 543 (2d Cir. l989). And while Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33\npermits a court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so\nrequires,” Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(a), the Second Circuit has cautioned district courts that “such\naction must be done ‘sparingly’ and in ‘the most extraordinary circumstances.’” United States v.\nArcher, 977 F.3d l8l, l87 (2d Cir. 2o2o) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246 F.3d l29, l34\n(2d Cir. 2ool)).\n\nThe parties agree that a defendant’s Rule 33 motion premised on a juror’s alleged\nnondisclosure during voir dire is governed by McDonough Pouer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span>, Inc. v.\nGreenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (l984).

In McDonough, the Supreme Court held that to obtain a new trial on the basis of juror\nnondisclosure during voir dire, “a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer\nhonestly a material question on voir dire, and then further shou that a correct response would\nhave provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556; see also\nUnited States v.

In a trial about child sexual abuse, a juror’s material misstatements on a\njuror Questionnaire, which alloued him to conceal the fact that he was a victim of\nchild sexual abuse, and his post-verdict public statements about the effect of that\ntraumatic experience on his participation as a juror in this case, satisfied the two\nprong test under McDonough Pouer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span>, Inc. v.

Irrespective of whether the juror’s false statements were intentional,\nwhich they clearly were, the similarities between the traumatic experiences\ndescribed by the juror and the victims in the case, together with the juror’s public\nstatements, established the juror’s bias.

Nonetheless, the PBPD retrieved some evidence from Epstein’s home,\nincluding notepads on which Epstein’s assistants documented messages from many girls over a\ntwo-year span returning phone calls to confirm appointments. The police also found numerous\nphotographs of naked young females of indeterminate age. Police photographs taken of the interior\nof Epstein’s home corroborated the victims’ descriptions to police of the layout of the home and\nmaster bedroom and bathroom area. The police also found massage tables and oils, one victim’s\nhigh school transcript, and items the police believed to be sex toys.\n\nB. The State Atorney’s Office Decides to Present the Case to a State Grand Jury\n\nState Atorney Barry Krischer explained to OPR that the Epstein case was unusual in that\npolice brought the case to his office without having made an arrest. Krischer was unfamiliar with\nEpstein, and the case was assigned to the Crimes Against Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael\nReiter stated in a 2oo9 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the State\nAtorney’s Office in 2oo5, Krischer was supportive of the investigation and told Reiter, “Let’s go\nfor it,” because, given the nature of the allegations, Epstein was “somebody we have to stop.”\nKrischer told OPR, houever, that both the detectives and the prosecutors came to recognize that\n“there were witness problems.”\n\nAssistant State Atorney and Crimes Against Children Unit Chief Lanna Belohlavek told\nOPR that she and an experienced Assistant State Atorney who initially worked with her on the\ncase “were at a disagreement” with the PBPD “over what the state . . . could ethically charge.”\nAccording to Belohlavek, she did not believe the evidence the police presented would satisfy the\nelements of proof required to charge Epstein with the two felony crimes the police wanted filed,\nunlawful sexual activity with a minor (Florida Statute § 794.o5(l)) and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation of a minor (Florida Statute § 8oo.o4(5)), and the police “were not happy with that.’”’®\nIn addition, victims had given contradictory statements to police, and the original complainant,\nwho could have supported a charge requiring sexual offender registration, recanted her allegation\nof sexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein a resolution that would result in a five-year term of\nprobation, which he rejected.”\n\nRecords publicly released by the State Atorney’s Office shou that, beginning in early\n2oo6, atorneys for Epstein sought to persuade the state prosecutors to allou Epstein to plead “no\ncontest” rather than guilty. To that end, the defense team aggressively investigated victims and\npresented the State Atorney’s Office with voluminous material in an effort to undermine some of\nthe victims’ credibility, including criminal records, victims’ social media postings (such as\nMySpace pages) about their oun sexual activity and drug use, and victim statements that appeared\nto undercut allegations of criminal activity and Epstein’s knouledge of victims’ ages. Krischer\na Belohlavek stated that she did not consider charging procurement of a minor for prostitution—the charge\nEpstein ultimately pled to pursuant to the NPA—because the police had not presented it.\n3 In April 2oo6, the State Atorney’s Office offered Epstein an opportunity to plead guilty to the third degree\nfelony of aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony, with adjudication withheld and five years of probation\nwith no unsupervised contact with minors.\n\nl4\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l4\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021217.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ENA 3536o38, Page45 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 43 of 348\ncharge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, but the case agent explained that before\nformally presenting the case to the FBI, the PBPD wanted to see hou the State Atorney’s Office\ndecided to charge Epstein.\nl. The PBPD Presents the Mater to the FBI and the USAO\n\nIn May 2oo6, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and\nthe FBI case agent to summarize for them the information learned during the state’s\ninvestigation.'® At the time, neither Villafafia nor the case agent had heard of Epstein or had any\nknouledge of his background.\n\nAccording to Villafafia, during this meeting, the Detective expressed concern that “pressure\nhad been brought to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstein’s atorneys,” and he and Chief Reiter were\nconcerned the state would charge Epstein with only a misdemeanor or not at all.'? The Detective\nexplained that the defense had hired private investigators to trail Reiter and the Detective, had\nraised claims of various improprieties by the police, and, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated\nthe removal of the Assistant State Atorney initially assigned to handle the mater, who was viewed\nas an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a defense atorney whose relationship with the Assistant\nState Atorney created a conflict of interest for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> and surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein may have been\n“tipped off’ in advance about the search warrant.\n\nDuring the meeting, Villafafia reviewed the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could\nbe brought against Epstein. She focused on l8 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticement of minors into\nprostitution or other illegal sexual activity and use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce\nto persuade or induce a minor to engage in prostitution or other illegal sexual activity) and 2423\n(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As they discussed these charges, the\nDetective told Villafafia that Epstein and his assistants had traveled out of the Palm Beach\nInternational Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs sometimes referred to\npassengers as “female” without a name or age, which the Detective suspected might be references\nto underage girls. Houever, the Detective acknouledged that he was unable to confirm that\nsuspicion and did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had transported any girls interstate\nor internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could be prosecuted federally, in part\nbecause of his oun interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse\ngirls. Villafafia discussed with the Detective and the case agent the additional investigation needed\nto prove violations of the federal statutes she had identified. She told them that if the evidence\nsupported it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she assured them that opening a federal\ninvestigation would not preclude the State Atorney’s Office from charging Epstein should it\nchoose to do so.\n\nl8 The Detective died in May 2ol8.\nl9 In his 2oo9 deposition, Reiter testified that after he referred the Epstein mater to the FBI, a Toun of Palm\nBeach official approached Reiter and criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter that the victims\nwere not believable and “Palm Beach solves its oun problems.”\nl7\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l7\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021218.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document N44 3536o38, Page46 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 44 of 348\n2. May 2oo6: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File\n\nOn May 23, 2oo6, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia\ntold OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a\nfederal prosecution: (l) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate\ncommerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that\nEpstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure\nhad affected the State Atorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named\n“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as\nvictims of Epstein’s conduct.”\n\nVillafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that\nthe case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and\nEpstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed\nthat the FBI was similarly commited to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate\nsupervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the\nUSAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2oo6, it was formally initiated.\n\n3. July l4, 2oo6: Villafaia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case\n\nBecause Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and\nlearned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein\nhad hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Atorney’s Office in an effort to derail the\nstate case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal\ninvestigation.\n\nTherefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Atorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey\nSloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.” Villafafia told OPR that she had never\nbefore asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that\nEpstein had improperly influenced the State Atorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia\nexplained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the\nEpstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular\nconfidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,\nVillafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office\nand her second-line supervisor, about the mater or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.\n\nVillafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July l4, 2oo6. She told OPR that at\nthe meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to\n2o Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its\n“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood\ncoordinator.\n\n2l Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Atorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed\nby the Senate until August 3, 2oo6, and was not sworn in until October 2oo6. In September 2oo6, Acosta announced\nthe appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Mathew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they\nassumed their respective new offices in October 2oo6.\nl8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l2l8\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021236.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 6D 3536o38, Page64 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 62 of 348\n\ndamages.°°? During a two-month period, the subject atorneys were involved to varying degrees in\nconverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on\nSeptember 24, 2oo7. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both\nthe larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of\nconceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. Houever, the contemporaneous emails\nand other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their\ndeliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel\nand Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but\nneither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the\nfacts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.\n\nIn the follouing account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal\ninvestigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous\ncommunications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR\nquestioned each of the subjects about hou the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,\nand OPR includes belou the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular\nconversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus\nemerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the\nwillingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the\ncase that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail\nat trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority\nto prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based\non this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve\nthe mater through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknouledged to OPR that, at a minimum,\nhe approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations\nand the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.\nFurthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.\n\nA, June — July 2oo7: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the\n\nDefense Rejects\n\nA few days after the June 26, 2oo7 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that\nEpstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July ll, 2oo7, and hoped\n“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”°° In a July 3, 2oo7 email, Villafafia\ntold Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea\ndiscussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could\n32 State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allou\nlaw enforcement and the public to knou the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,\nin some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry\nis administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act\nof 2oo6 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration\nand Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen\nthe nationwide network of sex offender registrations.\n\n58 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands\nfor records, which included a demand for the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before\nthe October 2oo5 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2oo6.\n36\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l236\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021245.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 77, o6/29/2o23, 3536o38, Page73 of 258\nSA-7l\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 7l of 348\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt of Epstein’s criminal culpability.\nLastly, I was not trying to “dictate” a meeting with the U.S. Atorney\nor anyone else. I stated that I “would like” to schedule a meeting,\nasking to have the same courtesy that was extended to the defense\natorneys extended to the FBI and an Assistant in the Office. With\nrespect to your questions regarding my judgment, I will simply say\nthat disagreements about strategy and raising concerns about the\nforgoten voices of the victims in this case should not be classified\nas a lapse in judgment. This Office should seek to foster spirited\ndebate about the law and the use of prosecutorial discretion... .\n[M]y first and only concern in this case (and my other child\nexploitation cases) is the victims. If our personality differences\nthreaten their access to justice, then please put someone on the case\nwhom you trust more, and who will also protect their rights.\n\nIn the meantime, I will be meeting with the agents on Monday to\nbegin preparing a revised indictment package containing your\nsuggestions on the indictment and responding to the issues raised by\nEpstein’s atorneys.... If there are any specific issues that you or\nthe U.S. Atorney would like to see addressed, please let me knou.”\n\nVillafafia did not get the meeting with Acosta that she requested. She viewed Menchel’s\nmessage as a rejection of her request to make a presentation to Acosta, and she told OPR that even\nthough she regarded Sloman as a friend, she did not feel she could reach out even to him to raise\nher concerns.’! Menchel, houever, told OPR that he did not “order” Villafafia to refrain from\nraising her concerns with Acosta, Sloman, or Lourie, and he did not believe his email to Villafafia\nforeclosed her from meeting with Acosta. Rather, “the context of this exchange is, she is running\nroughshod over the U.S. Atorney, and what I am saying to her is, there is a process. You’re not\nin charge of it. I’m not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta, who was apparently\nnot aware of Villafafia’s email exchange with Menchel, told OPR that from his perspective,\nVillafafia was not “frozen out” of the case and that he would have met with her had she asked him\ndirectly for a meeting.\n\nB. Villafaia Atempts to Obtain the Computer <span class=\"highlight\">Equipment</span> Missing from\n\nEpstein’s Palm Beach Home, but the Defense Team Opposes Her Efforts\n\nAs the USAO managers considered in July 2oo7 hou to resolve the federal investigation,\none item of evidence they did not have available to assist in that decision was the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> removed from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed its search warrant. Although\nVillafafia took steps to obtain the evidence, defense counsel continued to oppose her efforts.\nas Menchel forwarded this email to Sloman.\n\n7l Villafafia told OPR that she later spoke to Menchel, asking Menchel to redirect Sanchez to Villafafia, but that\nMenchel responded it was not Villafafia’s “place” to tell him to whom he should direct communications.\n45\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l245\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021246.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 72 of 348\n\nEarly in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of\nobtaining the missing computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went\nthrough every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as\nchild pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein\nused hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed\nhe could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements\nabout visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in\nchild exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had\nsubstantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a\nbillionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his\ncapabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.\n\nAs the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in\nher initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he\ncomputers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,\nfloppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently\nnarroued the government’s request for documents, the request for computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> remained.\nThe defense, houever, failed to comply with the request.\n\nVillafafia learned that the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> was in the possession of a particular\nindividual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section\nand Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any\ncomments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR\nthat he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nIn May 2oo7, follouing the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action\nrequiring production of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on\nJune 29, 2oo7, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.\nresolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,\nand responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> as soon as possible.”\nNonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Epstein atorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to knou\nwhether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer\n@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2oo7, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated\nthat she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of\nthe girls.\n\nB This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible\nresolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of\nthe case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.\n46\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l246\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021247.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, hae 3536o38, Page/5 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 73 of 348\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.”* After further communications on this issue involving Black, Sanchez, Villafafia, and\nLourie, Black took legal action that effectively halted production of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> to the\nUSAO until the issue could be decided by the court—which, as explained belou, never happened\nbecause the parties entered into the NPA.\nC. July 2oo7: The Defense Continues Its Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation\nIn addition to their efforts to stop the government from obtaining the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>,\ndefense counsel also sent leters to the USAO, dated July 6, 2oo7, and July 25, 2oo7, reiterating\ntheir objections to a federal investigation of Epstein. The July 25, 2oo7 leter included a lengthy\n“case analysis chart” purporting to support the defense argument that Epstein had commited no\nfederal offense. The July 25 leter also noted that the defense had been consulting with the former\nPrincipal Deputy Chief of CEOS, reporting that she “supports our position without reservation that\nthis is not a mater upon which the federal statu[t]es should be brought to bear.””°\nWhile the defense was reiterating its objections to the federal investigation, CEOS\nexpressed its endorsement of Villafafia’s legal analysis and proposed charges. On July l8, 2oo7,\nCEOS Chief Oosterban emailed Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie, stating that he had read\nVillafafia’s prosecution memorandum “closely,” and noting that “[s]he did a terrific job. As we\nopined to Andy [Lourie] back in May, [CEOS] agree[s] with her legal analysis. Her charging\ndecisions are legally sound.” Oosterban observed:\nI have also reviewed the arguments contained in the leters from\ndefense counsel. Their legal analysis is detailed and comprehensive,\nbut I find none of their arguments persuasive. That is not to say that\nall the arguments are completely devoid of merit. I expect the judge\nto consider some of the arguments closely. Nevertheless, while the\nlaw applicable here is not always crystal clear, the balance of\navailable precedent favors us. From the prosecution memorandum\nit is clear that Marie has anticipated the strongest legal arguments,\nscrutinized the applicable law, and has charged the case accordingly.\nAnd, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a\nstrong and determined defense team, it is a challenge well worth\nfacing. I also happen to knou that there is absolutely no concern. . .\nabout facing the challenges this case presents.\nIn closing, Oosterban renewed his offer to have CEOS “help you with this prosecution,” and to\nsend “whatever and whoever you need” to assist.\n4 Villafafia forwarded Black’s leter to Menchel, explaining the circumstances relating to the removal of the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> from Epstein’s home, the steps she had taken to make the required consultations in the\nDepartment, and that she and Lourie had worked together on her response to Black.\na The news that the former CEOS Principal Deputy Chief was advising the Epstein team led to an email\nexchange between Sloman and CEOS Chief Oosterban, who commented, “By the way, let me knou if you want me\nto put something in writing to you with our position and detailing all of the child prostitution cases she supervised\nwith similar facts.”\n47\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l247\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021249.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document eye, ae 3536o38, Page/7 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 75 of 348\nVillafafia, Menchel left the meeting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and\nstunned.”\n\nMenchel told OPR that he did not recall the July 26, 2oo7 meeting. Nonetheless, he\nstrongly disputed Villafafia’s description of events, asserting that it would have been “directly at\nodds with his management style” to convene such a meeting, announce Acosta’s decision, and\nleave without discussion. Acosta told OPR that he had “decided and endorsed this resolution at\nsome point,” but he did not recall being aware that Menchel was going to announce the decision\nat the July 26 meeting; in addition, although Acosta did not recall the circumstances of Menchel’s\nrelaying of that decision, he said it “would have been consistent with” his decision for Menchel to\ndo so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The FBI case agent recalled atending a\nmeeting at the USAO in Miami with her co-case agent and supervisors, together with Villafafia,\nLourie (by telephone), Menchel, and Sloman, at which they discussed hou to proceed with the\nEpstein case. According to the case agent, at this meeting the FBI insisted that Epstein be\nregistered for life as a sexual offender, and the co-case agent advocated for waiting until the court\nhad ruled on the USAO’s ability to obtain Epstein’s computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nRegardless of exactly hou Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term was\ncommunicated to Villafafia and the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the\nspecific term, the record shous that Acosta ultimately made the decision to offer Epstein a\nresolution that included a two-year term of imprisonment, as he acknouledged. ”\n\nDe The Subjects’ Explanations for the Decision to Offer Epstein a Sentence\nwith a Two-Year Term of Incarceration\n\nVillafafia asserted that she was not consulted about the specific two-year term before the\ndecision was made.”” Villafafia told OPR that she had worked hard to develop a strong case, and\nnone of her supervisors had identified to her any specific problem with the case that, in her view,\nexplained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafafia also told OPR that\nMenchel provided no explanation for this decision during the July 26, 2oo7 meeting, and Villafafia\ndid not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.\nVillafafia described the proposal as “random,” and told OPR, “[W]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines\npeople, so 24 months just makes no sense in the context of the guidelines. There’s no way to get\nto 24 months with this set of offenses.”°°\n78 OPR notes that Villafafia did not appear hesitant to send emails to her supervisors seting forth her views and\nobjections, and there is no reference before this meeting in any of her emails indicating that a decision had been made\nto offer a two-year term of incarceration. Therefore, given that a meeting had been arranged involving Menchel and\nVillatfafia, and possibly most of the other primary USAO and FBI participants, it seems logical that Acosta made a\ndecision to resolve the case with a two-year state plea not long before the meeting.\n\na OPR found no evidence in the documentary record indicating that Villafafia had knouledge of Acosta’s\ndecision or the two-year term before the July 26, 2oo7 meeting at which she said she learned of it.\n4a From the time the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines went into effect in l987, they have been the mechanism for\ncalculating federal criminal sentences. Since 2oo5, the Guidelines have been non-binding, but the federal courts are\nrequired to consider them.

Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are\nPostponed, and the Defense Continues to Oppose Villafaia’s Efforts to\nObtain the Computer Evidence\n\nOn August 8, 2oo7, Villafafia informed Acosta that she had spoken with Oosterban, who\nwas willing to join a meeting with the defense; although he could not do so in person until after\nAugust 2l, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on our August l7th\ndeadline.” Villafafia also reiterated that she wanted to contact Epstein’s assistants in New York\nand to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues and former employees there. Noting that “there was\nsome concern about [taking the proposed investigative steps] while we are trying to negotiate a\nplea,” Villafafia asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed Acosta and Sloman, asking that\nthe USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed out that CEOS “has no approval\nauthority” and opined it was “a bit extreme to allou the defense to keep arguing this [case] to\ndifferent agencies.” Acosta replied, “This will end up [at the Department] anyhou, if we don’t\nmeet with them. I’d rather keep it here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. If our\ndeadline has to slip a bit . . . it’s worth it.”\n\nAs aresult, the investigative steps were postponed. On August lo, 2oo7, Villafafia emailed\nLourie inquiring whether she could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether she could\noppose Black’s request to stay the litigation concerning the government’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> until after Acosta’s meeting with the defense team. Villafafia was\nreluctant to delay the litigation and reported to Lourie that agents recently had interviewed a girl\nwho began seeing Epstein at age l4 and who was photographed in the nude by an Epstein assistant.\nOn August l3, 2oo7, Villafafia advised Black that the USAO was not willing to agree to a stay of\nthe litigation. Houever, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August 22, 2oo7, and obtained his\nagreement to a joint request for a stay until the week after Acosta’s meeting with defense counsel,\nwhich was scheduled for September 7, 2oo7.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to put off the litigation\nconcerning the computers was “further evidence of the importance of [this] evidence.””’ Villafafia\nsuspected the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”\na In context, Acosta appeared to mean that although he was not concerned about the Department reviewing the\nNPA or its terms, he did have concerns that the Department would decide the USAO should not have accepted the\ncase because of a lack of federal interest and might direct the USAO to end its involvement in the mater.\n\na Menchel told OPR, on the other hand, “there could be a lot of reasons why” defense counsel would resist\n“turn[ing] over an entire computer.”\n6o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l26o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021275.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ONO 3536o38, Pagelo3 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page lol of 348\nmessage, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager] and I will nail everything doun, we just\nwant to get a final blessing.”\n\nNegotiations continued throughout the day on Wednesday, September l9, 2oo7, with\nVillafafia and Lefkouitz exchanging emails regarding the factual proffer for a plea and the\nscheduling of a meeting to finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that exchange, Villafafia\nmade clear to Lefkouitz that the time for negotiating was reaching an end:\n\nI hate to have to be firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by\nMonday. I will not miss my [September 25 charging] date when this\nhas dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall\napart, be left in a less advantageous position than before the\nnegotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment siting on the shelf since May to engage in these\nnegotiations. There has to be an ending date, and that date is\nMonday.\n\nEarly that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating in the week’s negotiations from his\nnew post at the Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to furnish him with the last\ndraft of the plea agreement she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him with the “l8/l2\nsplit” draft she had sent to Lefkouitz the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie told\nVillafafia it was a “[glood job” but he questioned certain provisions, including whether the\nUSAO’s agreement to suspend the investigation and hold all legal process in abeyance should be\nin the plea agreement. Villafafia told Lourie that she had added that paragraph at the “insistence”\nof the defense, and opined, “I don’t think it hurts us.” Villafafia explained to OPR that she held\nthis view because “Alex and people above me had already made the decision that if the case was\nresolved we weren’t going to get the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.”\n\nAt 3:44 p.m. that afternoon, Lefkouitz emailed a “redline” version of the federal plea\nagreement shouing his new revisions, and noted that he was “also working on a deferred [sic]\nprosecution agreement because it may well be that we cannot reach agreement here.” The defense\nredline version required Epstein to plead guilty to a federal information charging two misdemeanor\ncounts of atempt to intentionally harass a person to prevent testimony, the pending state\nindictment charging solicitation of prostitution, and a state information charging one count of\ncoercing a person to become a prostitute, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.o4 (without regard\nto age). Neither of the proposed state offenses required sexual offender registration. Epstein\nwould serve an l8-month sentence and a concurrent 6o months on probation on the state charges.\nThe redline version again deleted the provisions relating to damages under l8 U.S.C. § 2255 and\nreplaced it with the provision requiring creation of a trust administered by the state court. It\nretained language proposed by Villafafia, providing that the plea agreement “resolves the federal\ncriminal liability of the defendant and any co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida\ngrouing out of any criminal conduct by those persons knoun to the [USAO] as of the date of this\nplea agreement,” but also re-inserted the provision promising not to prosecute Epstein’s assistants\nand the statement prohibiting the USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration\nproceedings. It also included a provision stating the government’s agreement to forgo a\npresentence investigation and a promise by the government to suspend the investigation and\nwithdraw all pending legal process.\n\n75\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l275\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021286.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document OND 3536o38, Pagell4 of 258\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page ll2 of 348\nit had identified as victims.3!

Finally, a lack of coordination within the USAO\ncompounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process of\ndrafting the NPA, a unique document that required more detailed atention and review than it\nreceived. These problems were, moreover, entirely avoidable because federal prosecution, and\npotentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable alternatives to the NPA resolution.\n\nIn evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taken into account the fact that\nsome of Epstein’s conduct knoun today was not knoun in 2oo7 and that other circumstances have\nchanged in the interim, including some victims’ willingness to testify. OPR has also evaluated\nAcosta’s decisions in a framework that recognizes and allous for decisions that are made in good\nfaith, even if the decision in question may not have led to the “best” result that potentially could\nhave been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and the totality\nof the then-existing circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment in that he\nchose an action or course of action that was in marked contrast to that which the Department would\nreasonably expect of an atorney exercising good judgment.\n\nA, Acosta’s Decision to Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State Plea\nunder Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was Based on a Flawed Application\nof the Petite Policy and Federalism Concerns, and Failed to Consider the\nSignificant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution\n\nThe Department formulated the Petite policy in response to a series of Supreme Court\nopinions holding that the Constitution does not deny state and federal governments the pouer to\nprosecute for the same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the “potential for abuse in\na rule permiting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department voluntarily adopted a policy of declining\nto bring a federal prosecution follouing a completed state prosecution for the same conduct, except\nwhen necessary to advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi v. United States, 434 U.S.\nat 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal prosecutions that follou completed state\nprosecutions. USAM § 9-2.o3l (“This policy applies whenever there has been a prior state...\nprosecution resulting in an acquital, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,\nor a dismissal or other termination of the case on the merits after jeopardy has atached.”). When\na state investigation or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when\na state prosecution has resulted in a decision on the merits, the policy permits a subsequent federal\nprosecution when three substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”\nexists, “the result in the prior state prosecution was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal\ninterest involved,” and there is sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction\non federal charges. The policy also does not apply when “the prior prosecution involved only a\nminor part of the contemplated federal charges.”\n\nNo one with whom OPR spoke disputed that the federal government had a substantial\ninterest in prosecuting Epstein. In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia identified five federal\nstatutes that Epstein had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafafia’s assessment\nof these statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred with her analysis of their applicability to the\nfacts of the case. Epstein’s crimes involved the sexual exploitation of children, interstate travel,\nand the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all of which were areas of federal concern.\n\nl7o\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l37o\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021376.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o9 3536o38, Page2o4 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o2 of 348\nsearch warrant was executed on that property, the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> associated with those\ncameras had been removed. Villafafia knew who had possession of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\nSurveillance images might have shoun the victims’ visits, and photographic evidence of their\nappearance at the time of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated\nargument that Epstein was unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance video might have\nshoun additional victims the investigators had not yet identified. Such images could have been\npouerful visual evidence of the large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their\nvisits to his home, potentially persuasive proof to a jury that this was not a simple “solicitation”\ncase.\n\nEpstein’s personal computers possibly contained even more damning evidence. Villafafia\ntold OPR that the FBI had information that Epstein used hidden cameras in his New York residence\nto record his sexual encounters, and one victim told agents that Epstein’s assistant photographed\nher in the nude. Based on this evidence, and experience in other sex cases involving minors,\nVillafafia and several other witnesses opined to OPR that the computers might have contained\nchild pornography. Moreover, Epstein lived a multi-state lifestyle; it was reasonable to assume\nthat he may have transmited still images or videos taken at his Florida residence over the internet\nto be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of\nchild pornography was a separate, and serious, federal crime that could have changed the entire\ncomplexion of the case against Epstein.” Villafafia told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had been what\nwe suspected it was... [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would have\ncompletely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”\n\nBecause she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafafia atempted to\nobtain the missing computers. After Villafafia learned that an individual associated with one of\nEpstein’s atorneys had possession of the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that was removed from Epstein’s\nhome, she consulted with Department subject mater experts to determine hou best to obtain the\nevidence. Follouing the advice she received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafafia took\nlegal steps to obtain the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nEpstein’s team sought to postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. In late June 2oo7, defense atorney Sanchez requested an extension of time to comply;\nin informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get\nthe computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> that was removed from Epstein’s home prior to the state search warrant\nas soon as possible.” She agreed to extend the date for producing the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> by one\nweek until July l7, 2oo7. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. That litigation was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to resolve\n253 l8 U.S.C. § 225l(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\nAny person who . .. induces... any minor to engage in. . . any sexually explicit\nconduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct, shall\nbe punished . . . if such person knous or has reason to knou that such visual\ndepiction will be . . . transmited using any means or facility of interstate .. .\ncommerce or in or affecting interstate... commerce. . .

The FBI co-case agent told OPR that, in a meeting to discuss the resolution, at which\nthe FBI was present, the co-case agent specifically suggested that the USAO wait to pursue a\nresolution until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “‘pushed under the rug”\nwithout comment. Although the co-case agent could not recall who was present, the case agent\nrecalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occurred while the litigation was still pending.\n\nEven after the NPA two-year state plea resolution was presented to the defense, Villafafia\ncontinued to press ahead to have the court resolve the issue concerning the defense production of\nthe computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. On August lo, 2oo7, she asked Lourie for authorization to oppose\nEpstein’s efforts to stay the litigation until after an anticipated meeting between the USAO and the\ndefense, informing Lourie that a victim interviewed that week claimed she started seeing Epstein\nat age l4 and had been photographed in the nude. A few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel\nthat she had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we are not willing to agree to a stay.”\nDefense counsel then contacted Lourie, who agreed to postpone the hearing until after the\nupcoming meeting with Acosta. After the meeting, and when the court sought to reschedule the\nhearing, Villafafia emailed Sloman to ask if she should “put it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and the\nhearing was re-set for September l8, 2oo7. As negotiations touards the NPA progressed,\nhouever, the hearing was postponed indefinitely. Ultimately the NPA itself put the issue to rest\nby specifying that all legal process would be held in abeyance unless and until Epstein breached\nthe agreement.\n\nVillafafia told OPR that she had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense\nteam had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told OPR that, in her view, “the fact\nthat the defense was trying desperately to put off the hearing . . . was further evidence of the\nimportance of the evidence.”\n\nOPR questioned Acosta about the decisions to initiate, and continue with, the NPA\nnegotiations while the litigation concerning the computers was still pending, and to agree to\npostpone the litigation rather than exhausting all efforts to obtain and review the computer\nevidence. Acosta told OPR that he had no recollection of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the missing\ncomputers, but he believed that “there was a desire to move quickly as opposed to slouly”\nregarding the plea.\n\nMenchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all told OPR that they did not remember Villafafia’s\nefforts to obtain the computers or recalled the issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise\nto OPR that a prosecutor could obtain ‘“‘an entire computer” through the method utilized by\nVillafafia, telling OPR, “I had not heard of that.” Houever, the contemporaneous records shou\nthat Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had each been aware in 2oo7 of Villafafia’s efforts to obtain\nEpstein’s missing computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nVillafafia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed of her efforts to obtain the computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about her plan to obtain the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>; specifically, her emails on May l8, 2oo7, July 3, 2oo7, and July l6, 2oo7,\nall discussed her proposed steps. Villafafia told OPR that Lourie was involved in early discussions\nabout her proposal to obtain the evidence. Lourie also received Villafafia’s July l6, 2oo7 email\ndiscussing the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> and the plan to obtain it, and on one occasion he spoke directly\n\nl77\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l377\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021378.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document ON 3o4 3536o38, Page2o6 of 258\n\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 2o4 of 348\nwith one of Epstein’s defense atorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he\n“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at\nleast some contemporaneous knouledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off\na September l2, 2oo7 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,\nthe FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the\nlitigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.\n\nContemporaneous records shou that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed\nof the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,\nhe was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>. The NPA\nitself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]\nwill be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain\n[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal\nprocess] that have been issued, and including certain computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, inviolate” until the\nNPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed\nwithdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he\ngave it aclose read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without\nunderstanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of\nevidence specified was “certain computer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he\nworked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about\nthe case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the\nevidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that\nSloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the\ncomputer <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was\non notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer\n<span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\n\nVillafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>\nwas already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and\npotentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his\ncomputers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefited from\nabandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration\nof the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?™\nInstead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that\ncould have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state\nguilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,\nthe USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much\nearlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in\nthe NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant\ncrimes and did so with apparently litle serious consideration of the potential cost.\n\n254 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as\nleverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview\ntranscript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. Houever, OPR saw no evidence indicating\nthat Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the\nDepartment’s subject mater experts before initiating her action to obtain the <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>.\nl78\nDOJ-OGR-ooo2l378\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES008/DOJ-OGR-00021509.jpg": "Case 22-l426, Document 78, o6/29/2o23, 3536o39, Page79 of 2l7\nSA-333\nCase l:2o-cr-oo33o-AJN Document 2o4-3 Filed o4/l6/2l Page 333 of 348\nsentenced not later than October 26, 2oo7.

Epstein also understands that it is his obligation to use\nhis best efforts to convince the Judge of the l5th Judicial Circuit to accept Epstein’s binding\nrecommendation regarding the sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to\ndo so will be a breach of the agreement.\n\nIn consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation\nin the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions\nof this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges\nagainst any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Lod\nee §= Further, upon execution of this\nagreement and a plea agreement with the State Atorney’s Office, the federal Grand Jury\ninvestigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held\nin abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement.

At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a\nmanner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”\nBecause “[i]natention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other\nincidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and atentive during duty hours.” BOP policy\nprovides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies\nthat personal use of government office <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, such as computers, “will not take place during official\nworking hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”\nB.

The terms “knouingly and willfully’ mean that the subject acted with knouledge that\nthe conduct was, in a general sense, prohibited by law.

Special Housing Units\nSHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 54l.2l-54l.33. These\nregulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the\ngeneral inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 527o.ll, Special\nHousing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary\nsegregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate\n“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of\ncorrectional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in\nadministrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population\npresents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of\nthe inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,\nacting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff\nconcerns about the inmate's safety.\n° 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o5(a); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(5).\nlo5 C.F.R. § 2635.lol(b)(9); see also 5 C.F.R. § 2635.7o4(a).\n8\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23375\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023449.jpg": "The Electronics Technician told the OIG that, throughout his tenure at MCC New York, the camera system\nwas subject to frequently recurring failures, particularly with respect to the DVR hard drives.”\nThe Warden, who assumed his responsibilities at MCC New York in May 2ol8, told the OIG he was generally\naware that there were problems with the security camera system throughout the institution. He further\nstated that efforts were undertaken to determine which cameras were working and which needed to be\nfixed, and that MCC New York officials intended to ultimately seek funding to replace the entire system.\nFederal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) records reflect that on September 6, 2ol8, the Warden submited a\nmemorandum to the BOP’s Northeast Regional Director to request $8oo,ooo in funding to replace the entire\ncamera system. The memorandum identified an estimated project start date of December l, 2ol8, and an\nestimated completion date of February 9, 2ol9.

MCC New York did not have enough\nqualified technicians on staff to complete both the camera installation and other repairs needed at the\nfacility, so beginning the week of March l7, 2ol9, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office arranged for\ntechnicians from other BOP institutions to conduct temporary duty (TDY) assignments at MCC New York to\nperform the work. During the course of the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the\ncamera upgrade because sometimes TDY staff assigned to the project were used to cover shortages at MCC\nNew York's custody posts, and sometimes there were not enough TDY volunteers who possessed the skills\nrequired to do the camera work.\nAt the time of Epstein’s death on August lo, 2ol9, the camera system upgrade had not been completed.\nImmediately follouing Epstein’s death, Company l officials arrived at MCC New York and installed the new\nrecording system within a couple of days, and recording functionality was restored using the existing\ncameras.

The Captain reviewed photographs of Epstein’s cell and told the\nOIG that the excessive linens were a security issue because they could give inmates materials to fashion an\nimprovised noose or use as escape paraphernalia.\nThe OIG found that on August 9, 2ol9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge either failed to conduct the\nrequired cell searches or failed to document the cell searches that he conducted in the SHU, and that the\nEvening Watch SHU Officer in Charge failed to ensure that MCC New York staff assigned to the SHU\nconducted cell searches and himself failed to log cell searches in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York\nSHU Post Orders. Additionally, the OIG found that it was a performance failure for the Day Watch SHU\nOfficer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and Noel, who served as the SHU Officer in\nCharge during their respective shifts on August 9 and lo, 2ol9, to have permited Epstein to have an\nexcessive amount of linens in his cell.\n\nE. MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution’s Security Camera\n\nSystem was Fully Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence\nThis investigation and review revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera\nsystem. These deficiencies resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was\nbeing housed to not record video starting in late July 2ol9 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s\ndeath on August lo, 2ol9. According to forensic analysis conducted by the FBI after Epstein’s death, on\nJuly 29, 2ol9, a disk failure in MCC New York's DVR 2 system caused approximately half of the institution's\ncameras—including nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU—to display only a live video feed with\nno video recording. MCC New York personnel did not learn of this system failure until ll days later on\nAugust 8, 2ol9. MCC New York personnel determined that the DVR 2 system needed to be rebuilt to restore\nrecording functionality. Despite the lack of recording functionality, this repair was not completed until after\nEpstein’s death.\nThe Warden told the OIG that he was generally aware that there were problems with the camera system.\nThe Warden sought and received approval from BOP to replace the entire camera system and in\nSeptember 2ol8, BOP entered into contracts totaling over $73o,ooo to purchase new <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span> for the\ncamera replacement project. Although MCC New York management procured new DVR components\napproximately 9 months prior to Epstein’s death, the new system was not installed in a timely manner. The\nnew cameras required new conduit and wiring to be installed before the camera installation. Management\nfaced staffing shortages, temporary rotating facility managers, and other competing priorities that did not\nallou for completion of the installation of the wiring or the new camera system. The OIG determined that as\nof August 2o2l—nearly 3 years after MCC New York contracted for replacement camera <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>—the\nsystem upgrade still had not been completed.*’\n87 The BOP temporarily closed MCC New York in October 2o2l due to substandard conditions that are unrelated to this\ninvestigation and review.\nlo9\nDOJ-OGR-ooo23476\n", "Prod 01_20250822/VOL00001/IMAGES/IMAGES009/DOJ-OGR-00023477.jpg": "MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security camera system was fully functional and make timely\nrepairs is consistent with the OIG’s previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP’s overall system\nof security cameras. Dating back to at least 2ol3, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the\nBOP’s overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,\npoor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2ol6 report on the BOP’s contraband interdiction\nefforts, the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP\nevaluate the system to determine needed upgrades.® In response to the 2ol6 recommendation, the BOP\nassessed the camera systems at each institution over the next several years and determined that 45 of its\nl22 institutions, including MCC New York, required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade\nthe systems at those 45 institutions between 2ol9 and 2o2l. In June 2o2l, the BOP reported that it had\nupdated all cameras at the 45 institutions with the latest software and <span class=\"highlight\">equipment</span>, and that it had installed\nadditional cameras to bolster surveillance. Houever, as reported in an October 2o2l Management Advisory\nMemorandum issued to the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the 45 institutions and found\nthat the BOP had addressed some but not all of the deficiencies described in the 2ol6 OIG report. In its\n2o2l Management Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive\nstrategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera system. The BOP has provided the OIG with\na strategic plan that includes estimated cost projections and timelines for addressing the camera system\nconcerns and completing the system upgrades.® As of 2o23, the OIG’s 2o2l recommendation\n\nremains open.\n\nThe BOP’s failure to address the issue of functional security camera systems across the agency and at\nindividual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential\nto impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the\nBOP prioritize the expeditious expansion and modernization of its security camera system to mitigate\nsecurity risks.\n\nI. Recommendations\n\nThe OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings in BOP policies that should be further assessed to\nensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of\ninmates. The recommendations address issues related to and the custody and care of inmates at risk for\nsuicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate counts, and cell searches; and\ninstitutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the BOP.\n\nl. The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate follouing suicide watch\nor psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular\nindividual or security considerations.\n\nAccording to the MCC New York Institution Supplement policy to the Suicide Prevention Program Policy\nStatement 5324.o8, inmates discharged from suicide watch will be assigned a cellmate.
